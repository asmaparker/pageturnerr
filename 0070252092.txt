{'book': {'publisher': 'Tab Books', 'synopsis': "With this unique book, you can broaden your knowledge about intriguing natural occurrences like earthquakes, sunspots, and lightning strikes by building and using inexpensive, yet sensitive and accurate, devices for monitoring seismic activity, atmospheric anomalies, and solar disturbances. By combining the more than 40 projects included inside, you can construct your own complete scientific monitoring station!<br/>You'd pay thousands for this type of hard-to-find equipment at commercial outlets, yet these devices can be made from readily available parts at an average cost of just $25. Each skill-building project has been field-tested by author Gary G. Giusti, a National Weather Service spotter and longtime student of earthquakes and weather phenomena. Giusti provides a handy parts list and complete instructions for all projects.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/97/9780070252097.jpg', 'title_long': 'How to Build Earthquake, Weather, and Solar Flare Monitors', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 1.13758527192 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.13758527192}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 290, 'date_published': '1995', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Earth Sciences', 'Atmospheric Sciences'], 'authors': ['Gary G.
