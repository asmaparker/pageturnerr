{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': "Wesley, spurting with kinetic energy, nasty wit, and kindness to animals, ought to be a star. Or so it seems to those who nip at his heels, turn up everywhere he goes, and lie in wait for him around every corner. They are his followers -- he calls them Behindlings. And they make quite an ensemble, with their own questionable intentions, irritating habits, and weird manners. But they bury all disagreement in the common pursuit of their prize, their Wesley.<br/>Then there are those who simply stay put. Catherine Turpin lies defiantly in the bed she makes for herself while, outside, her failings are broadcast widely, painted on walls, even. When one of Wesley's newest followers, Jo Bean, turns out to be more interested in confronting Catherine than sticking with the behindlings, plots that have been twisted up come undone.<br/>With Behindlings, the inimitable Nicola Barker takes a character who is perhaps her most compelling creation to date, and lets him run off with her readers.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/95/9780060185695.jpg', 'title_long': 'Behindlings: A Novel', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.9 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 544, 'date_published': '2003-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Humorous'], 'authors': ['Nicola Barker'], 'title': 'Behindlings: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060185695', 'msrp': 27.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060185694', 'isbn10': '0060185694'}}
