Plus the shock of morning classes isn't the only change in store.<br/>An unexpected letter turns up at Alexander's mansionâ€”announcing his parents will be coming to town. And once they arrive, just about everyone has had a sighting of the macabre couple except Raven. What could be delaying Alexander from introducing Raven to them? Could Alexander be hiding something about his parents' homecoming?<br/>When Raven is finally invited to the most thrilling dinner party of her life, the next turn of events could transform her entire future with Alexander.
