{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Beauty and her beast . . .<br/>Viscount Nicholas Stoneworth is infamous—even being mentioned in the same breath with him is enough to ruin a lady's reputation. Why, the man's spent years in London's underworld pursuing every sort of vice while parlaying his hard muscled body into fame and fortune as a fighter! With his brother's untimely death, Nicholas must assume the title and relearn the civilized ways of the ton . . . and proper Jane Fenton is more than willing to teach him everything she knows.<br/>Circumstances may have forced Jane into the role of ladies' companion, but she knows the danger of associating with a notorious man like Nicholas, a man who could tempt any woman into certain scandal. But her brother disappeared into the same underworld four long years ago, and if she transforms the libertine into a gentleman, he will use his connections to find him. Still, Jane will not—cannot—lose control. She must ignore the promise of sinful pleasure in his eyes . . . and her own wild desires desperate to break free.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/13/9780061470813.jpg', 'title_long': 'Her Notorious Viscount', 'edition': 'Original', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41005980732 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41005980732}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2009-03-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Jenna Petersen'], 'title': 'Her Notorious Viscount', 'isbn13': '9780061470813', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061874159'}, 'isbn': '0061470813', 'isbn10': '0061470813', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061874154', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
