Day argues persuasively that old ways of competing and much of the conventional wisdom about organizations are being overturned by a convergence of forces: mass markets are fragmenting into narrow segments that are themselves becoming global markets; information technologies are blurring the boundaries between markets and organizations while accelerating the pace of decisions; technological change continues to shrink product life cycles while customers are demanding ever higher levels of responsiveness and quality.
