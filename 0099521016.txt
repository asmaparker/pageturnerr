{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "Gun shots rang out in the grandest mansion in Savannah, Georgia, in the early hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder, or self-defence?<br/><br/>For nearly a decade, the shooting, and its aftermath, reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks, and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.<br/><br/>It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the 'soul of pampered self-absorption'; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/13/9780099521013.jpg', 'title_long': 'Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil: A Savannah Story', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.42769678828 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.42769678828}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '1994', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Murder & Mayhem', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology', 'Customs & Traditions'], 'authors': ['John Berendt'], 'title': 'Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil: A Savannah Story', 'isbn13': '9780099521013', 'msrp': 16.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099521016', 'isbn10': '0099521016'}}
