{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'Herbert Molin, a retired police officer, lives alone in a remote cottage in northern Sweden. Two things seem to consume him; his passion for the tango, and an obsession with the "demons" he believes to be pursuing him. Early one morning shots shatter Molin\'s windows...by the time his body is found it is almost unrecognisable. Stefan Lindman is another off-the-job police officer. On extended sick leave due to having cancer of the tongue, Lindman hears about the murder of his former colleague and, in a bid to take his mind off his own problems, decides to investigate. As his investigation becomes increasingly complex, it is with both horror and disbelief that Lindman uncovers links to a global web of neo-Nazi activity. Written with all the usual flair so highly commended by Mankell fans this intricate crime novel, with its cast of new characters, heralds the end of the Kurt Wallander Mysteries and yet, ultimately, it leads the story back to Wallander\'s Ystad where a new outstanding series of thrillers can begin.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/62/9780099455462.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Return of the Dancing Master', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.3307 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 1.29921 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.3307}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.29921}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59965735264}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.00786}}, 'pages': 520, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Historical', 'International Mystery & Crime', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Henning Mankell'], 'title': 'The Return of the Dancing Master', 'isbn13': '9780099455462', 'msrp': 14.45, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099455463', 'isbn10': '0099455463'}}
