{"book": {"publisher": "HarperTorch", "synopsis": "Bernie Rhodenbarr has gone legit -- almost -- as the new owner of a used bookstore in New York"s Greenwich Village. Of course, dusty old tomes don"t always turn a profit, so to make ends meet, Bernie"s forced, on occasion, to indulge in his previous occupation: burglary. Besides which, he likes it.<br/>Now a collector is offering Bernie an opportunity to combine his twin passions by stealing a very rare and very bad book-length poem from a rich man's library.<br/>The heist goes off without a hitch. The delivery of the ill-gotten volume, however, is a different story. Drugged by the client's female go-between, Bernie wakes up in her apartment to find the book gone, the lady dead, a smoking gun in his hand, and the cops at the door. And suddenly he's got to extricate himself from a rather sticky real-life murder mystery and find a killer -- before he's booked for Murder One.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/12/50/9780060731250.jpg", "title_long": "The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling (Bernie Rhodenbarr)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.33 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.76}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.33}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2005-03-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Cozy', 'International Mystery & Crime', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Lawrence Block'], 'title": "The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling (Bernie Rhodenbarr)", "isbn13": "9780060731250", "msrp": 7.5, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "006182819X", "ePub": "006182819X"}, "isbn": "0060731257", "isbn10": "0060731257", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061828195", "binding": "print"}]}}
