{"book": {"publisher": "Harvest Books", "synopsis": "Congressman John Lewis takes readers inside the civil rights movement in"Walking with the Wind"and shares rare insight into the personalities at its heart.<br/>As Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Congressman John Lewis was at the epicenter of the civil rights movement in the late \"50s and \'60s. Arrested more than forty times, he was one of its youngest and most courageous leaders. Writing with charm, warmth, and honesty, Lewis moves from the Nashville lunch counter sit-ins as he reflects on the era to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where he led more than five hundred marchers on what became known as 'Bloody Sunday.' Though there have been exceptional books on the movement, Lewis\'s profound personal story is 'destined to become a classic in civil rights literature' ('Los Angeles Times').', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/85/9780156007085.jpg", "title_long": "Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement", "edition": "1st Harvest ed", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.79 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.79}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 496, "date_published": "1999-10-18", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political', 'History', 'Americas', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John Lewis', 'Michael D'Orso'], 'title": "Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement", "isbn13": "9780156007085", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0156007088", "isbn10": "0156007088"}}
