{"book": {"publisher": "Wisdom Publications", "synopsis": "Is Yoda a Zen Master? What might Jedi training be like? Is the story of Luke Skywalker a spiritual epic?<br/><br/>The answers--as well as excitement, adventure, and a lot of fun--are here!<br/><br/>The Dharma of Star Wars uses George Lucas" beloved modern saga and the universal discoveries of the Buddha to illuminate each other in playful and unexpectedly rewarding ways. Bortolin even reveals satisfying depths to the second trilogy of movies-the ones that met with what can understatedly be called a less-than-warm critical reception. The Dharma of Star Wars gives you an inpsiring and totally new take on this timeless saga, from A New Hope all the way up to 2005"s Revenge of the Sith. Great fun for any Star Wars fan.
