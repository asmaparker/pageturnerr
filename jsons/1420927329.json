{"book": {"publisher": "Digireads.com", "synopsis": ""In his clear preface, Gilbert Murray says with truth that The Trojan Women, valued by the usage of the stage, is not a perfect play. "It is only the crying of one of the great wrongs of the world wrought into music." Yet it is one of the greater dramas of the elder world. In one situation, with little movement, with few figures, it flashes out a great dramatic lesson, the infinite pathos of a successful wrong. It has in it the very soul of the tragic. It even goes beyond the limited tragic, and hints that beyond the defeat may come a greater glory than will be the fortune of the victors. And thus through its pity and terror it purifies our souls to thoughts of peace.' So begins the introduction to 'The Trojan Women' by Euripides as translated by Gilbert Murray.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/20/9781420927320.jpg", "title_long": "The Trojan Women", "dimensions": "Height: 7.99211 Inches, Length: 4.99999 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.1917319 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.99999}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.1917319}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.25}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.99211}}, "pages": 80, "date_published": "2006", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Ancient & Classical'], 'authors": ["Euripides'], 'title": "The Trojan Women", "isbn13": "9781420927320", "msrp": 5.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1420927329", "isbn10": "1420927329"}}
