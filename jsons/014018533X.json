{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "The Third Man is Greene\"s brilliant recreation of post-war Vienna, a city of desolate poverty occupied by four powers. Rollo Martins, a second-rate novelist, arrives penniless in Vienna to visit his old friend and hero Harry Lime. Harry is dead, but the circumstances surrounding his death are highly suspicious, and his reputation, at the very least, dubious.<br/><br/>Graham Greene said of The Third Man that he 'wanted to entertain [people], to frighten them a little, to make them laugh' and the result is both a compelling narrative and a haunting thriller. The Fallen Idol is the chilling story of a small boy caught up in the games that adults play. Left in the care of the butler, Baines, and his wife, Philip realizes too late the danger of lies and deceit. But the truth is even deadlier.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,
        700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.
