{'book': {'publisher': 'Copenhagen Business School Pr', 'synopsis': 'Product Description      This book deals with the main aspects of globalisation, namely trade, global financial flows, technology and transnational corporations, and international convergence of real wages. Its concern is with the beneficial and harmful aspects of globalisation.The author examines the impact of globalisation on growth, productivity, unemployment, income distribution, technology and institutions, as well as on culture. He discusses the role of government in the era of globalisation. One generally expects the scope of government to be diminished as globalisation proceeds. Instead, he argues that globalisation and free markets call not for less government but for more, as well as for pressures from the civil society.
