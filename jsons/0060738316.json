{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "The murder of a particularly difficult mother-of-the-bride has cast a pall on wedding planner Annabelle Archer's latest triumph -- and suspicion falls heavily on her sometime-business partner and friend Richard Gerard. Annabelle knows that even her trusted wedding emergency kit won't be able to salvage their careers if she and Richard can't find the real culprit.<br/>It's no easy task since the slain matron was perhaps the most hated socialite in D.C., but Annabelle navigates through the city's colorful wedding industry and powerful social scene on the deadly trail of a killer. Always the bridal consultant and never the bride, she's seen her fair share of bouquet tosses. But there's no telling what surprises a ruthless killer will throw her way if she gets too close.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/10/9780060738310.jpg', 'title_long': 'Better Off Wed: An Annabelle Archer Mystery', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.64}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2005-01-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Laura Durham'], 'title': 'Better Off Wed: An Annabelle Archer Mystery', 'isbn13': '9780060738310', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060738316', 'isbn10': '0060738316'}}
