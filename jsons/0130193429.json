Its strong coverage of traditional assessment vehicles is apparent in its comprehensive treatment of standardized tests. Non-traditional vehicles are also thoroughly examined in several chapters on informal evaluation methods. An objective perspective on issues surrounding the efficacy and effectiveness of assessment strategies is presented, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each type, to give readers a balanced rather than biased view. The book is divided into four parts\x97Introduction, Standardized Tests, Informal Assessments, and Assessment Systems\x97and organized to help readers understand assessment components. Coverage includes current trends and issues, as well as information on performance assessment, portfolios, and other methods of reporting a child's performance\x97such as observation, checklists, and rating scales that are appropriate for young children.
