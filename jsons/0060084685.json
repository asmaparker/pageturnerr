{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': 'For the sake of salt, Rome created a system of remuneration (from which we get the word salary), nomads domesticated the camel, the Low Countries revolted against their Spanish oppressors, and Gandhi marched against the British. Through the ages, salt has conferred status, preserved foods, and mingled in the blood, sweat, and tears of humankind.

With "enthusiasm and freshness" (Le Monde), he mixes literary analysis, history, anthropology, biology, physics, economics, art history, political science, chemistry, ethnology, and linguistics to create a full body of knowledge about the everyday substance that rocked the world and still brings zest to the ordinary.<br/>Salt is a tour de force about a substance that is one of the very foundations of civilization.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/84/9780060084684.jpg', 'title_long': 'Salt: Grain of Life', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.56}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.56}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2002-06-04', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Cooking by Ingredient', 'Herbs, Spices & Condiments', 'Cooking Education & Reference', 'History', 'Science & Math', 'Chemistry', 'General & Reference'], 'authors': ['Pierre Laszlo'], 'title': 'Salt: Grain of Life', 'isbn13': '9780060084684', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060084685', 'isbn10': '0060084685'}}
