{"book": {"publisher": "Broadway Books", "synopsis": "Spunky, sweet-natured Jessica Monroe is thirty-four years old and perfectly happy being single. Her girlfriends, however, disapprove. And when they secretly place a personal ad on a hot singles website on her behalf, Jess is reluctantly hurtled into the topsy-turvy world of online dating. A laugh-out-loud whirlwind of disastrous dates ensues, from Simon, who seems dreamy over e-mail but ditches her at the dinner table, leaving her with the bill, to Graham, a self-described “Ferrari driver” who turns out to be a car salesman—with several (old, fat, bald, creepy, cheap, stuck-up) men in between. When an unforeseen event turns her world upside down, Jess starts to wonder if the qualities she thinks she wants in a man—gorgeous, wildly successful, with a taste for fun and the finer things—really are what she ultimately needs . . . and whether, as a new mystery suitor appears in her e-mail inbox, Cupid has other possibilities up his sleeve.<br/><br/>Told with Jane Moore’s sparkling wit, wisdom, and sass, Love @ First Site is an irresistible tale about what happens when we start to look for love between the lines on a computer screen—and a winning, unputdownable look at contemporary romance.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/12/9780767916912.jpg", "title_long": "Love @ First Site: A Novel", "edition": "First Trade Paperback Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.89 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.23}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.82}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.6}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.89}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2006-05-09", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Women's Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Romance', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors": ["Jane Moore'], 'title": "Love @ First Site: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780767916912", "msrp": 11.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0767916913", "isbn10": "0767916913"}}
