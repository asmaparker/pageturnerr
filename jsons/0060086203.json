{"book": {"publisher": "HarperEntertainment", "synopsis": "The starship Oberon is searching for its AWOL pilot when it crash-lands on an unknown planet, leaving all but a handful of its crewmembers dead. And those who remain are not alone in this strange, inhospitable world. A savage insectile race waits just below the surface, massing to obliterate the unwanted invaders. And the Oberon"s last human survivors must look to unlikely allies for help: the apes they carried onboard. Using controversial gene technology, the starship"s scientists hope to transform the primates into a powerful army -- strong, agile, subservient...and intelligent. But the consequences of playing God promise to be more devastating than anyone could have ever anticipated, ushering in a dark and terrifying future that will pit slave against master, ape against Man.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/62/06/9780060086206.jpg", "title_long": "Planet of the Apes: The Fall", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.72}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "2002-06-04", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors": ["William T Quick'], 'title": "Planet of the Apes: The Fall", "isbn13": "9780060086206", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0060086203", "isbn10": "0060086203"}}
