{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "At an astonishingly young age, Edwidge Danticat has become one of our most celebrated new novelists, a writer who evokes the wonder, terror, and heartache of her native Haiti--and the enduring strength of Haiti"s women--with a vibrant imagery and narrative grace that bear witness to her people"s suffering and courage.<br/><br/>At the age of twelve, Sophie Caco is sent from her impoverished village of Croix-des-Rosets to New York, to be reunited with a mother she barely remembers. There she discovers secrets that no child should ever know, and a legacy of shame that can be healed only when she returns to Haiti--to the women who first reared her. What ensues is a passionate journey through a landscape charged with the supernatural and scarred by political violence, in a novel that bears witness to the traditions, suffering, and wisdom of an entire people.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/45/9780375705045.jpg", "title_long": "Breath, Eyes, Memory (Oprah"s Book Club)", 'edition": "2", "dimensions": "Height: 8.02 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.55 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.55}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.02}}, "pages": 234, "date_published": "1998-05-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Travel', 'Caribbean', 'Haiti', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Edwidge Danticat'], 'title": "Breath, Eyes, Memory (Oprah"s Book Club)", 'isbn13": "9780375705045", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "037570504X", "isbn10": "037570504X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781569477960", "binding": "print"}]}}
