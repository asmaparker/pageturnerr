{"book": {"publisher": "Gallery Books", "synopsis": "What"s a girl to do when she discovers she"s the main course on the menu?<br/><br/>Hip, funny Milagro de los Santos thinks she"s finally found love and a home at the California ranch of fabulous Oswald Grant and his urbane relatives, who have a rare genetic disorder that some call vampirism. But Milagro is bewildered when she's excluded from an ancient and mysterious midnight ceremony whose participants include Oswald's unfriendly parents, a creepy family elder, and Milagro's ex-lover, the powerful and decadent Ian Ducharme. What skeletons are the vampires keeping in their designer closets?<br/><br/>When Milagro's life is threatened by a rogue family member, she flees to the desert to hide. Instead of solitude, she encounters an egomaniacal actor, a partying heiress, a sly tabloid reporter, and a lavish spa full of dark secrets -- all of which might help her find a way home.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/99/9781416520399.jpg", "title_long": "Midnight Brunch (Casa Dracula Series, Book 2)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.2499835 Inches, Length: 5.3125878 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.999998 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.3125878}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.999998}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.2499835}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2007-04-24", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Hispanic', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Vampires', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Marta Acosta'], 'title": "Midnight Brunch (Casa Dracula Series, Book 2)", "isbn13": "9781416520399", "msrp": 20.22, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1416520392", "isbn10": "1416520392"}}
