{"book": {"publisher": "Chosen Books Pub Co", "synopsis": "Is there a God who cares about me? Will he show me the right thing to do? Will he forgive and heal me? In Meeting God at Every Turn, Catherine Marshall gives readers a resounding "Yes!" to these questions and more as she describes how she met God at the confusing, troubled, and scary points in her life.<br/>The twelve "turnings' that Marshall describes are the type of events that shape a person: growing up, love and marriage, facing death, making a living, starting over in relationships and business, and more. Meeting God at Every Turn tells what happened each time Catherine turned a corner-how she surprisingly encountered grace. It\'s her story, but every reader\'s too. Thirteen pages of family photographs are included.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/85/9780800792985.jpg", "title_long": "Meeting God at Every Turn", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2002", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["Catherine Marshall'], 'title": "Meeting God at Every Turn", "isbn13": "9780800792985", "msrp": 5.25, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "080079298X", "isbn10": "080079298X"}}
