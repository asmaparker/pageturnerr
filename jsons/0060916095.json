{"book": {"publisher": "HarperOne", "synopsis": "‘The material contained in this volume was originally presented in the form of talks to students, teachers and parents in India, but its keen penetration and lucid simplicity will be deeply meaningful to thoughtful people everywhere, of all ages, and in every walk of life. Krishnamurti examines with characteristic objectivity and insight the expressions of what we are pleased to call our culture, our education, religion, politics and tradition; and he throws much light on such basic emotions as ambition, greed and envy, the desire for security and the lust for power – all of which he shows to be deteriorating factors in human society.’From the Editor’s Note‘Krishnamurti’s observations and explorations of modern man’s estate are penetrating and profound, yet given with a disarming simplicity and directness. To listen to him or to read his thoughts is to face oneself and the world with an astonishing morning freshness.’Anne Marrow Lindbergh", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/60/91/9780060916091.jpg", "title_long": "Think on These Things", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.61}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.440924524}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "1989-10-11", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Happiness', 'History', 'Military', 'Strategy', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Other Eastern Religions & Sacred Texts', 'Taoism', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Eastern', 'Ethics & Morality', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Jiddu Krishnamurti'], 'title": "Think on These Things", "isbn13": "9780060916091", "msrp": 14, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "0062026399", "ePub": "0062026399"}, "isbn": "0060916095", "isbn10": "0060916095", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780062026392", "binding": "print"}]}}
