{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "The story no–one else can tell. Scott Peterson's sister gives her account of his marriage and his disturbing behaviour – and tells how she realised that her brother was capable of murder.<br/>What happens if, after being given up for adoption in childhood, you reestablish contact with your biological family – only to discover that your true brother is a killer? Anne Bird, the sister of Scott Peterson, knows first–hand.<br/>Soon after her birth in 1965, Anne was given up for adoption by her mother, Jackie Latham. Welcomed into the well–adjusted Grady family, she lived a happy life. Then, in the late 1990s, she got back in contact with her mother – now married – and her family, including Jackie's son, Scott Peterson, and his wife, Laci. Over the next several years, Anne shared the Petersons' holidays, family reunions, trips to Disneyland. Anne and Laci became pregnant at roughly the same time, and the two became confidantes. On Christmas Eve 2002, Laci Peterson went missing, and the happy facade of the Peterson family began to crumble. Anne helped in the search for Laci; Scott even stayed in her home while police tried to find his wife. Noticing Scott's bizarre behaviour, Anne grew suspicious that her brother knew more than he was telling. Then Laci's body – and that of her unborn son, Conner – were found . Had Scott Peterson murdered his wife and child in cold blood?<br/>Filled with newsmaking revelations and intimate glimpses of Scott and Laci, Blood Brother is an account of how long–dormant family ties dragged one woman into one of the most notorious crimes of our time.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/77/9780060838577.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.81}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2005-03-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Crime & Criminal Biographies', 'Murder & Mayhem'], 'authors': ['Anne Bird'], 'title': 'Blood Brother: 33 Reasons My Brother Scott Peterson Is Guilty', 'isbn13': '9780060838577', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060838574', 'isbn10': '0060838574'}}
