{"book": {"publisher": "W. W. Norton", "synopsis": "For the first time, all of Anton Chekhov"s drama in English in a single volume.<br/><br/>This stunning new translation presents the only truly complete edition of the playwright who is in the pantheon of the greatest dramatists in history. Anton Chekhov is a unique force in modern drama, his works interpreted and adapted internationally and beloved for their understanding of the human condition and their brilliant wit. This volume contains work that has never previously been translated, including the newly discovered farce The Power of Hypnosis and the first version of Ivanov, as well as Chekhov"s early humorous dialogues. No less important, Laurence Senelick, who has staged many of these plays, has freshly translated them to bring into English Chekhov"s jokes, the deliberate repetitions of his dialogue, and his verbal characterizations. Senelick has also annotated the works to bring clarity for the general reader and has included variants of the plays. His translations infuse new life into such classics as The Cherry Orchard and Three Sisters.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/58/9780393048858.jpg", "title_long": "The Complete Plays Anton Chekhov", "edition": "Annotated edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 2.94537582032 Pounds, Width: 2.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.94537582032}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.75}}, "pages": 992, "date_published": "2005-12-12", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Regional & Cultural'], 'authors": ["Anton Chekhov', 'Laurence Senelick'], 'title": "The Complete Plays Anton Chekhov", "isbn13": "9780393048858", "msrp": 39.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0393048853", "isbn10": "0393048853"}}
