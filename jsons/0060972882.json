{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': 'Darrell Sifford, an only child himself, has drawn from countless case studies and interviewed a wide range of psychologists to come up with a unique picture of the only child. He asks:<br/>What drives the only child to achieve at levels above and beyond other children? Why is it so hard for the only child to forgive and forget? Why are only children so respectful of authority? Why does it seem the only child has a bottomless need for praise? How can parents keep from spoiling and overvaluing their only child? How can only children break the chains of parental dependency?<br/><br/>This is the first warm, personal, and enormously helpful exploration of what it really means to grow up without siblings. It will leave only children feeling very good about themselves.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/82/9780060972882.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Only Child: Being One, Loving One, Understanding One, Raising One', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1990-02-13', 'subjects': ['Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting'], 'authors': ['Darrell Sifford'], 'title': 'The Only Child: Being One, Loving One, Understanding One, Raising One', 'isbn13': '9780060972882', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060972882', 'isbn10': '0060972882'}}
