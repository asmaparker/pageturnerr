{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperSanFrancisco', 'synopsis': 'Rodney Stark\'s "fresh, blunt, and highly persuasive account of how the West was won—for Jesus" (Newsweek)—a provocative report that challenges conventional wisdom and finds that Christianity\'s astounding dominance of the Western world arose from its offer of a better, more secure way of life.<br/>"Compelling reading" (Library Journal) that is sure to "generate spirited argument" (Publishers Weekly), this account of Christianity\'s remarkable growth within the Roman Empire is the subject of much fanfare. "Anyone who has puzzled over Christianity\'s rise to dominance ... must read it." says Yale University\'s Wayne A. Meeks, for The Rise of Christianity makes a compelling case for startling conclusions.<br/>Combining his expertise in social science with historical evidence, and his insight into contemporary religion\'s appeal, Stark finds that early Christianity attracted the privileged rather than the poor, that most early converts were women or marginalized Jews—and ultimately "that Christianity was a success because it proved those who joined it with a more appealing, more assuring, happier, and perhaps longer life" (Andrew M. Greeley, University of Chicago).', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/15/9780060677015.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries', 'edition': 'unknown', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.47619848592 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.61}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.47619848592}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '1997-05-09', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Churches & Church Leadership', 'Church History', 'Theology', 'Historical', 'History', 'World', 'Religious', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies', 'Sociology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Religious Groups Studies'], 'authors': ['Rodney Stark'], 'title': 'The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries', 'isbn13': '9780060677015', 'msrp': 18.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060677015', 'isbn10': '0060677015'}}
