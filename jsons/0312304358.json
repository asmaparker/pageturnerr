Then one day a rose-colored mark appears on her skin, and those dreams are stolen from her. Taken from her home and family, Rachel is sent to Kalaupapa, the quarantined leprosy settlement on the island of Moloka\"i. Here her life is supposed to end---but instead she discovers it is only just beginning.<br/>With a vibrant cast of vividly realized characters, Moloka\'i is the true-to-life chronicle of a people who embraced life in the face of death. Such is the warmth, humor, and compassion of this novel that 'few readers will remain unchanged by Rachel\'s story' (mostlyfiction.com).', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/55/9780312304355.jpg", "title_long": "Moloka"i", 'edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.6 Inches, Weight: 0.83334735036 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.83334735036}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.3}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "2004-10-04", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Native American', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Alan Brennert'], 'title": "Moloka"i", 'isbn13": "9780312304355", "msrp": 17.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312304358", "isbn10": "0312304358", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781429902281", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
