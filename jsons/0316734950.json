{"book": {"publisher": "Little, Brown and Company", "synopsis": "In 1993 Marie Gesto disappeared after walking out of a supermarket. Harry Bosch worked the case but couldn"t crack it, and the twenty-two-year-old was never found. Now, more than a decade later, with the Gesto file still on his desk, Bosch gets a call from the District Attorney. A man accused of two heinous murders is willing to come clean about several others, including the killing of Marie Gesto. Taking the confession of the man he has sought-and hated-for thirteen years is bad enough. Discovering that he missed a clue back in 1993 that could have stopped nine other murders may just be the straw that breaks Harry Bosch.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/50/9780316734950.jpg", "title_long": "Echo Park", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 405, "date_published": "2006-10-09", "subjects": ["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors": ["Michael Connelly'], 'title": "Echo Park", "isbn13": "9780316734950", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"ePub": "0759568782"}, "isbn": "0316734950", "isbn10": "0316734950", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780759568785", "binding": "saleableprint"}]}}
