{"book": {"publisher": "Scribner", "synopsis": "Does God Exist and Does He Care?<br/>In April 1997 Reynolds Price received an eloquent letter from a reader of his cancer memoir, A Whole New Life. The correspondent, a young medical student diagnosed with cancer himself and facing his own mortality, asked these difficultQuestions. The two began a long-distance correspondence, culminating in Price"s thoughtful response, originally delivered as the Jack and Lewis Rudin Lecture at Auburn Theological Seminary, and now expanded onto the printed page as Letter to a Man in the Fire.<br/>Harvesting a variety of sources -- diverse religious traditions, classical and modern texts, and a lifetime of personal experiences, interactions, and spiritual encounters -- Price meditates on God"s participation in our fate. With candor and sympathy, he offers the reader such a rich variety of tools to explore these questions as to place this work in the company of other great tetsaments of faith from St. Augustine to C. S. Lewis.<br/>Letter to a Man in the Fire moves as much as it educates. It is a rare combination of deep erudition, vivid prose, and profound humanity.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/78/9780684856278.jpg", "title_long": "Letter To A Man In The Fire: Does God Exist And Does He Care", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.24912235606 Pounds, Width: 0.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.24912235606}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 112, "date_published": "2000-10-17", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies', 'Philosophy', 'Worship & Devotion', 'Inspirational'], 'authors": ["Reynolds Price'], 'title": "Letter To A Man In The Fire: Does God Exist And Does He Care", "isbn13": "9780684856278", "msrp": 9.43, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1439105197", "ePub": "1439105197"}, "isbn": "0684856271", "isbn10": "0684856271", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781439105191", "binding": "print"}]}}
