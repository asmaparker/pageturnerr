{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall Direct', 'synopsis': 'Some go for the hard sell, others are soft-spoken. Some are flamboyant, others seem almost introverted. Some have led charmed lives, others were blocked at every turn. But these ten stockbrokers have at least one thing in common: they\'re the absolute, hands-down best in the business.<br/>For the first time anywhere, get a behind-the-scenes look at financial wizards like Martin D. Shafiroff of Shearson Lehman Brothers, Richard F. Connolly of Paine Webber, Gregory F. Wilbur of Kidder Peabody, and Tara Schuchmann of Merrill Lynch. Based on intimate interviews, this provocative book exposes the personality and fast-paced lives of ten super stockbrokers and tracks how they rose to the top of their profession.<br/>You\'ll feel like you know these luminaries personally as you listen to them tell, in their own words, these and more private tips and industry secrets: how they broke into the business--building a reputation from scratch--and today their clients include national and international business leaders, entrepreneurs, professional athletes, and entertainers; their special sales techniques--ten different styles for selling a brokers\' wares; their investment philosophies and strategies; how they efficiently manage their time--a "must-have" talent for the top stockbroker; how they build loyalty by indulging their clients with exceptional service; and how they balance work and life--proving that you don\'t have to be a workaholic to shine in the securities industry.<br/>Witness a "day in the life" of each of these top professionals--from jogging at 6 AM, to meeting with high-powered clients, to making key investments, to networking on the golf course.<br/>If you\'re an investor, you won\'t be able to resist rating your own broker against the top-flight performers in this book.
