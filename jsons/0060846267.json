{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "From the shadows of history -- out of the ancient prophecies and sacred texts -- comes a conspiracy so vast, so deep, so earth-shattering that the CIA itself is merely a cover for it.<br/>The ritualistic slaughter of a college professor right under the nose of CIA agent Jack Dunphy has damned the disgraced operative to a living hell of paper-pushing obscurity. But Dunphy's not ready to surrender his career until he uncovers the truth behind his demotion -- embarking on a covert investigation that's leading him into a world he never dreamed existed. And following a twisted trail of lies, Jack's about to become ensnared in a monstrous international web spun by a secret society as old as civilization.<br/>Escape is impossible -- because the players are too powerful, the consequences are too deadly . . . and what's at stake is no less than the destiny of the human race.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/68/9780060846268.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Magdalene Cipher', 'edition': '1st Avon Bks Ppbk Print: March 2006', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2006-02-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jim Hougan'], 'title': 'The Magdalene Cipher', 'isbn13': '9780060846268', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0062103253'}, 'isbn': '0060846267', 'isbn10': '0060846267', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062103253', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
