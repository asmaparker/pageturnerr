{"book": {"publisher": "Random House Audio", "synopsis": "The Sound and the Fury is the tragedy of the Compson family, featuring some of the most memorable characters in literature: beautiful, rebellious Caddy; the manchild Benjy; haunted, neurotic Quentin; Jason, the brutal cynic; and Dilsey, their black servant. Their lives fragmented and harrowed by history and legacy, the character’s voices and actions mesh to create what is arguably Faulkner’s masterpiece and one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>“I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire. . . . I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.” —from The Sound and the Fury", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/53/9780739325353.jpg", "title_long": "The Sound and the Fury", "edition": "Unabridged", "dimensions": "Height: 5.95 Inches, Length: 5.07 Inches, Weight: 0.49 Pounds, Width: 1.16 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.07}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.16}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.49}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.95}}, "pages": 7, "date_published": "2005-07-06", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["William Faulkner'], 'title": "The Sound and the Fury", "isbn13": "9780739325353", "msrp": 19.95, 'binding": "Audio CD", "isbn": "0739325353", "isbn10": "0739325353"}}
