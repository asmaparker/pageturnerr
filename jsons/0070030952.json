This second edition includes a revised gallery of good powerboats, new material on basic safety, preparations to go offshore, and improved illustrations of tricky maneuvers.<br/>Getting Started in Powerboating covers all powerboats--big and small; single-engine, twin-engine, outboard, and sterndrive; trailerable and non-trailerable; fast planing hulls and slow but seaworthy displacement hulls; and everything in between. It can help you decide what kind of boat is right for you, and it describes fully the characteristic handling and behavior of each type.<br/>Bob Armstrong tells you how to dock any boat under any conditions of wind, current, and crowding, and how to leave a slip with a minimum of fuss. He explains how to handle docklines, how to execute close-quarters maneuvers, how to anchor, run inlets, adjust trim for a better ride, and cope with heavy weather. He offers hints for judging the quality of a boat, tips for quick mastery of a boat you've never handled before, and an expert's views on the types of powerboats available--from runabouts to motoryachts to houseboats, jetboats, and catamarans--and what to expect from each.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/54/9780070030954.jpg', 'title_long': 'Getting Started in Powerboating', 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.1 Inches, Length: 7.3 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 0.57 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.57}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.10010668738}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.1}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1995-03-01', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Water Sports', 'Boating'], 'authors': ['Bob Armstrong'], 'title': 'Getting Started in Powerboating', 'isbn13': '9780070030954', 'msrp': 17.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0070030952', 'isbn10': '0070030952'}}
