{"book": {"publisher": "Arrow", "synopsis": "A hilarious and bittersweet tale of baby-blues and fruitless men.<br/><br/>At twenty-nine, fun-loving, good-natured Claire has everything she ever wanted: a husband she adores, a great apartment, a good job. Then, on the day she gives birth to her first baby, James visits her in the recovery room to tell her that he’s leaving her. Claire is left with a beautiful newborn daughter, a broken heart, and a body that she can hardly bear to look at in the mirror. So, in the absence of any better offers, Claire decides to go home to her family in Dublin. To her gorgeous man-eating sister Helen, her soap-watching mother, her bewildered father. And there, sheltered by the love of her (albeit quirky) family, she gets better. A lot better. In fact, so much better that when James slithers back into her life, he’s in for a bit of a surprise.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/99/86/9780099489986.jpg", "title_long": "Watermelon: A Walsh Family Novel", "edition": "Later Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 7.77 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.80689187892 Pounds, Width: 1.31 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.31}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.80689187892}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.77}}, "pages": 528, "date_published": "2006-01-09", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ['Marian Keyes'], 'title": "Watermelon: A Walsh Family Novel", "isbn13": "9780099489986", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0099489988", "isbn10": "0099489988"}}
