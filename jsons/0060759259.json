In the ninth and tenth centuries, King Alfred and his heirs fought to secure the survival of the last outpost of Anglo-Saxon culture by battling the ferocious Vikings, whose invading warriors had already captured and occupied three of England\"s four kingdoms.<br/>In A.D. 866, Uhtred, a boy of ten and the son of a nobleman, is captured in the same battle that leaves his father dead. His captor is the Earl Ragnar, a Danish chieftain, who raises the boy as his own, teaching him the Viking ways of war. As a young man expected to partake in raids and bloody massacres of the English, he grapples with divided loyalties, torn between Ragnar, the warrior he loves like a father, and Alfred, whose piety and introspection leave him cold. It takes a terrible slaughter and the unexpected joys of marriage for Uhtred to discover his true allegiance -- and to rise to his greatest challenge.<br/>Performed by Jamie Glover', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/92/54/9780060759254.jpg", "title_long": "The Last Kingdom CD (Saxon Stories)", "edition": "Abridged", "dimensions": "Height: 5.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.345 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.345}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.75}}, "pages": 6, "date_published": "2005-01-25", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ['Bernard Cornwell'], 'title": "The Last Kingdom CD (Saxon Stories)", "isbn13": "9780060759254", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Audio CD", "isbn": "0060759259", "isbn10": "0060759259"}}
