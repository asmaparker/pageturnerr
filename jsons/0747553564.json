A transsexual prostitute accidentally propositions his own father; a senator\"s serial infidelities leave him in hot water; two young lovers spend Christmas together high on different drugs. McInerney\"s characters struggle together in a shifting world where old certainties dissolve and nobody can be sure of where they stand. "How it Ended' is a powerful, funny and moving collection by one of the great storytellers of our time. 'Metropolitan, middle-class young people grow up to learn that their triumphs will be hollow and their relationships false. McInerney flourishes amid the desolation: a kind of breezy, upbeat tone informs these dry, sardonic meditations on worldliness' - Esquire'.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/64/9780747553564.jpg", "title_long": "How It Ended", "dimensions": "Height: 1.85039 Inches, Length: 7.99211 Inches, Weight: 0.3747858454 Pounds, Width: 9.99998 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.99211}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.99998}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.3747858454}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.85039}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2001", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ['Jay McInerney'], 'title": "How It Ended", "isbn13": "9780747553564", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0747553564", "isbn10": "0747553564"}}
