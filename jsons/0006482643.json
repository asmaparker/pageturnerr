{'book': {'publisher': 'Harpercollins Publishers', 'synopsis': "A famous photographer lying in a coma holds the key to the salvation of the world. But first he must travel back into the traumatic events of his childhood. Will Rabjohns has everything. He's handsome, he's rich, and he's revered as the world's greatest wildlife photographer. He's also a haunted man, driven to risk his life for his art -- to capture the raw tragedy of the wild, the beauty of nature's violence. After a near fatal encounter with a polar bear, he lies in a coma. There he must relive a central childhood memory: a meeting with ancient and terrible forces which revealed to him the mystery at the heart of nature. And he realizes that if he awakes, he must confront the darkness of his past and wage a war, not only for his own soul, but for the soul of the planet and every animal that breathes upon it.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/42/9780006482642.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sacrament', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.37007 Inches, Weight: 0.7054792384 Pounds, Width: 1.52 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.37007}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.52}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7054792384}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.00786}}, 'pages': 450, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Clive Barker'], 'title': 'Sacrament', 'isbn13': '9780006482642', 'msrp': 14.45, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0006482643', 'isbn10': '0006482643'}}
