{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'At fifteen, Faith Duckle was lured under the bleachers by a bunch of boys and brutally attacked. Now, almost a year later, a newly thin Faith is haunted by her past and by the flippant, cruel ghost of her formerly fat self who is bent on revenge.<br/>Faith eventually turns to violence for retribution, forcing her to flee home in search of the only friend she has -- a troubled but caring busboy who is the lover of a sideshow performer -- and to tumble into the colorful, transient world of the circus. But as she dives headfirst into a world of adult passions and dreams, mercurial allegiances, and exhilarating self-discovery, Faith must also face some disturbing truths about herself and the world around her.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/64/9780060534264.jpg', 'title_long': "Wonder When You'll Miss Me: A Novel", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2004-03-16', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Amanda Davis'], 'title': "Wonder When You'll Miss Me: A Novel", 'isbn13': '9780060534264', 'msrp': 12.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061854050'}, 'isbn': '0060534265', 'isbn10': '0060534265', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061854057', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
