{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "A riveting collection of literary journalism by the bestselling author of The Perfect Storm, capped off brilliantly by a new Afterword and a timely essay about war-torn Afghanistan -- a superb eyewitness report about the Taliban's defeat in Kabul -- new to book form.<br/>Sebastian Junger has made a specialty of bringing to life the drama of nature and human nature. Few writers have been to so many disparate and desperate corners of the globe. Fewer still have met the standard of great journalism more consistently. None has provided more starkly memorable evocations of extreme events. From the murderous mechanics of the diamond trade in Sierra Leone, to an inferno forest fire burning out of control in the steep canyons of Idaho, to the forensics of genocide in Kosovo, this collection of Junger's reporting will take readers to places they need to know about but wouldn't dream of going on their own. In his company we travel to these places, pass through frightening checkpoints, actual and psychological, and come face-to-face with the truth.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/13/9780060088613.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fire', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.7 Inches, Length: 8.01 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 5.34 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.01}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.34}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2002-09-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'African', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Science & Math', 'Earth Sciences', 'Natural Disasters', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government'], 'authors': ['Sebastian Junger'], 'title': 'Fire', 'isbn13': '9780060088613', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060088613', 'isbn10': '0060088613'}}
