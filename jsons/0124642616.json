{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Pr', 'synopsis': 'Neural and Brain Modeling reviews models used to study neural interactions. The book also discusses 54 computer programs that simulate the dynamics of neurons and neuronal networks to illustrate between unit and systemic levels of nervous system functions. The models of neural and brain operations are composed of three models of generic mechanisms; models of specific neuronal systems; and models of generic operations, networks, and systems. The text discusses the computational problems related to galvanizing a neuronal population though an activity in the multifiber input system. The investigator can use a computer technique to simulate multiple interacting neuronal populations. For example, he can investigate the case of a single local region that contains two populations of namely, a parent population of excitatory cells, and a second set of inhibitory neurons. Computer simulation models predict the various dynamic activity occurring in the complicated structure and physiology of neuronal systems. Computer models can be used in "top-down" brain/mind research where the systemic, global, and emergent properties of nervous systems are generated. The book is recommended for behavioral scientists, psychiatrists, psychologists, computer programmers, students, and professors in human behavior.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/14/9780124642614.jpg', 'title_long': 'Neural and Brain Modeling (Neuroscience : A Series of Monographs and Texts)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.8959754532 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.8959754532}}, 'pages': 643, 'date_published': '1987', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Ronald J.
