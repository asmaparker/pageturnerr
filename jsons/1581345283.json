{"book": {"publisher": "Crossway", "synopsis": "“For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.”<br/>Ephesians 6:12<br/>Ashton is just a typical small town. But when a skeptical reporter and a prayerful, hardworking pastor begin to investigate mysterious events, they suddenly find themselves caught up in a hideous New Age plot to enslave the townspeople, and eventually the entire human race. The physical world meets the spiritual realm as the battle rages between forces of good and evil.<br/>This Present Darkness is a gripping story that brings keen insight into spiritual warfare and the necessity of prayer. Since its original publication more than 2.7 million copies have been sold. The companion volume, Piercing the Darkness, continues the story of the battle between spiritual forces.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/85/9781581345285.jpg", "title_long": "This Present Darkness", "edition": "Revised", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.80027801106 pounds, Width: 1.14 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.14}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.80027801106}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 375, "date_published": "2003-06-26", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["Frank E.
