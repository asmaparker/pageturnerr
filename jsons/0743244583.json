But now destiny was about to manifest itself. I felt like it was looking right at me and nobody else.”<br/><br/>So writes Bob Dylan in Chronicles: Volume One, his remarkable book exploring critical junctures in his life and career. Through Dylan’s eyes and open mind, we see Greenwich Village, circa 1961, when he first arrives in Manhattan. Dylan’s New York is a magical city of possibilities—smoky, nightlong parties; literary awakenings; transient loves and unbreakable friendships. Elegiac observations are punctuated by jabs of memories, penetrating and tough. With the book’s side trips to New Orleans, Woodstock, Minnesota, and points west, Chronicles: Volume One is an intimate and intensely personal recollection of extraordinary times.<br/><br/>By turns revealing, poetical, passionate, and witty, Chronicles: Volume One is a mesmerizing window on Bob Dylan’s thoughts and influences. Dylan’s voice is distinctively American: generous of spirit, engaged, fanciful, and rhythmic. Utilizing his unparalleled gifts of storytelling and the exquisite expressiveness that are the hallmarks of his music, Bob Dylan turns Chronicles: Volume One into a poignant reflection on life, and the people and places that helped shape the man and the art.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/89/9780743244589.jpg", "title_long": "Chronicles: Volume One", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4375}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2005-10-03", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Musical Genres', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Authors', 'Composers & Musicians', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Bob Dylan'], 'title": "Chronicles: Volume One", "isbn13": "9780743244589", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0743272587", "ePub": "0743272587"}, "isbn": "0743244583", "isbn10": "0743244583", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780743272582", "binding": "print"}]}}
