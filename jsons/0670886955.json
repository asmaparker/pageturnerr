{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Uk", "synopsis": "The Red Army had much to avenge when it finally reached the frontiers of the Reich in January 1945. Political instructors rammed home the message of Wehrmacht and SS brutality. The result was the most terrifying example of fire and sword ever known, with tanks crushing refugee columns under their tracks, mass rape, pillage and destruction. Hundreds of thousands of women and children froze to death or were massacred because Nazi Party chiefs, refusing to face defeat, had forbidden the evacuation of civilians. Over seven million fled westwards from the terror of the Red Army.<br/>Antony Beevor, using often devastating new material from former Soviet files, as well as from German, American, British, French and Swedish archives, has reconstructed the experiences of those millions caught up in the nightmare of the Third Reich"s final collapse. Berlin - The Downfall 1945 is a terrible story of pride, stupidity, fanaticism, revenge and savagery, yet it is also one of astonishing endurance, self-sacrifice and survival against all odds.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/51/9780670886951.jpg", "title_long": "Berlin: The Downfall 1945", "edition": "First Edition, First Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 9.4488 Inches, Length: 6.41731 Inches, Weight: 2.1605301676 Pounds, Width: 1.85039 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.41731}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.85039}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.1605301676}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.4488}}, "pages": 528, "date_published": "2002", "subjects": ["History', 'World', 'Jewish'], 'authors": ["Antony Beevor'], 'title": "Berlin: The Downfall 1945", "isbn13": "9780670886951", "msrp": 29.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0670886955", "isbn10": "0670886955"}}
