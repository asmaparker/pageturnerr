Jake Page looks at dogs' wild brothers, the wolves, and their closer cousins, the wild or pariah dogs; explains the newest theory of how dogs were domesticated; describes a dog's development from puppyhood on; and finally ponders a dog's emotional life and intelligence. And as an added bonus, Page's own pack of dogs makes multiple cameo appearances.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/05/9780061132605.jpg', 'title_long': 'Do Dogs Laugh?: Where Dogs Come From, What We Know About Them, and What They Think About Us', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.42549216566 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.58}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.42549216566}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2008-11-18', 'subjects': ['Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Dogs'], 'authors': ['Jake Page'], 'title': 'Do Dogs Laugh?: Where Dogs Come From, What We Know About Them, and What They Think About Us', 'isbn13': '9780061132605', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0061132608', 'isbn10': '0061132608'}}
