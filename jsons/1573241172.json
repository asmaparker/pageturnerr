{"book": {"publisher": "Red Wheel/Weiser", "synopsis": "Philosopher-poet and cancer survivor, Mark Nepo opens a new season of freedom and joy--an escape from deadening, asleep-at-the wheel sameness--that is both profound and clarifying. His spiritual daybook is a summons to reclaim aliveness, liberate the self, take each day one at a time, and to savor the beauty offered by life"s unfolding. Reading his poetic prose is like being given second sight, exposing the reader to life"s multiple dimensions, each one drawn with awe and affection. The Book of Awakening is the result of his journey of the soul and will inspire others to embark on their own. Nepo speaks of spirit and friendship, urging readers to stay vital and in love with this life, no matter the hardships. Encompassing many traditions and voices, Nepo"s words offer insight on pain, wonder, and love. Each entry is accompanied by an exercise that will surprise and delight the reader in its mind-waking ability.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/75/9781573241175.jpg", "title_long": "The Book of Awakening: Having the Life You Want by Being Present to the Life You Have", "edition": "Original", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.10010668738}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 436, "date_published": "2000-05-31", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Motivational', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Mental & Spiritual Healing'], 'authors": ["Mark Nepo'], 'title": "The Book of Awakening: Having the Life You Want by Being Present to the Life You Have", "isbn13": "9781573241175", "msrp": 18.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1573241172", "isbn10": "1573241172"}}
