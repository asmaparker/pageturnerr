{'book': {'publisher': 'Engeseth Publishing', 'synopsis': "Move business forward and drag Top Management along with you! Al Ries' best selling book, The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR, shook the advertising industry to the bone. The advertising world was outraged. When Ries argued that advertising just wasn't working any more, he had struck a nerve. Advertising was simply not changing with the times. Half a decade later, things have come full circle. PR is now finding its credibility in the intensive care unit. Stefan Engeseth gives the PR business the same treatment. The Fall of PR & the Rise of Advertising, with a foreword by Al Ries, analyses the enormous changes in the media landscape in PR, advertising and everything in between. Stefan Engeseth's books, Detective Marketing and ONE, have firmly established him as one of today's most refreshing business thinkers. In his latest book, The Fall of PR & the Rise of Advertising, he shows how advertising has redefined itself and re-emerged as a force to be reckoned with. Written in his trade mark, funny, original and provocative style, the book adds whole new dimensions to the business world.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/75/9789163307775.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Fall of PR & the Rise of Advertising', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.44}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044933474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 206, 'date_published': '2009-06-21', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Advertising', 'Public Relations', 'Skills', 'Communications'], 'authors': ['Stefan Engeseth'], 'title': 'The Fall of PR & the Rise of Advertising', 'isbn13': '9789163307775', 'msrp': 13.97, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9163307774', 'isbn10': '9163307774'}}
