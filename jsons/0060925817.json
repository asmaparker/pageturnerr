Martin as source material for Game of Thrones, comes a classic book on innovation and technological change in medieval Europe<br/>In this account of Europe’s rise to world leadership in technology, Frances and Joseph Gies show how early modern technology and experimental science were direct outgrowths of the decisive innovations of medieval Europe, in the tools and techniques of agriculture, craft industry, metallurgy, building construction, navigation, and war. The Gieses report that many of Europe’s most important inventions—the horse harness, the stirrup, the magnetic compass, cotton and silk cultivation and manufacture, papermaking, firearms, and “Arabic” numerals—had their origins outside Europe, in China, India, and the Middle East. Europe synthesized its own innovations—the three-field system, water power in industry, the full-rigged ship, the putting-out system—into a powerful new combination of technology, economics, and politics.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/58/19/9780060925819.jpg", "title_long": "Cathedral, Forge and Waterwheel: Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages (Medieval Life)", "edition": "60th ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.69225150268 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.83}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.69225150268}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 357, "date_published": "1995-01-06", "subjects": ["History', 'Europe', 'Great Britain', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Science & Math', 'History & Philosophy', 'Technology'], 'authors": ["Joseph Gies', 'Frances Gies'], 'title": "Cathedral, Forge and Waterwheel: Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages (Medieval Life)", "isbn13": "9780060925819", "msrp": 15.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0062016601", "eBook": "0062016601", "ePub": "0062016601"}, "isbn": "0060925817", "isbn10": "0060925817", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780062016607", "binding": "ebook"}]}}
