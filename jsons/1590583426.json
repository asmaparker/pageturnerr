When farmer Carroll Calhoun refuses the archaeologists\' request to investigate an ancient Native American mound, Faye and her colleagues are disappointed. But his next action breaks their hearts: he tries to bulldoze the huge relic to the ground.<br/>Later Calhoun is found dead, his throat sliced with a handmade stone blade. Was he killed by an archaeologist angered by his wanton destruction of history? Did a Choctaw take up arms to defend an embattled heritage? Did someone decide to even the score with an old rival?', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/25/9781590583425.jpg", "title_long": "Effigies (Faye Longchamp Mysteries, No. 3)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.86 Inches, Length: 5.78 Inches, Weight: 1.25002102554 Pounds, Width: 1.08 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.78}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.08}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.25002102554}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.86}}, "pages": 301, "date_published": "2007-01-15", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', 'Women's Fiction', 'United States', 'Native American', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Amateur Sleuths'], 'authors": ["Mary Anna Evans'], 'title": "Effigies (Faye Longchamp Mysteries, No. 3)", "isbn13": "9781590583425", "msrp": 24.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1590583426", "isbn10": "1590583426"}}
