{'book': {'publisher': 'Pan American Health Organization', 'synopsis': 'In recent years, zoonoses and communicable diseases common to man and animals have gained increasing attention worldwide. Human diseases that have their origins in infected animals―such as AIDS, SARS, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob―have highlighted the need for a better understanding of animal diseases.<br/>The ease and speed of modern travel facilitates the spread of diseases once confined to specific geographic areas, as recently occurred with the Covid-19 epidemic. Animal migration and trade pose a similar threat, as was shown by the outbreaks in the United States of West Nile fever and monkeypox―two diseases not previously known in the Western Hemisphere. Each of these examples highlights the need for accurate, up-to-date information, such as that presented here in the latest edition of Zoonoses and Communicable Diseases Common to Man and Animals.<br/><br/>This edition, published for the first time in three volumes, covers:<br/><br/>I. Bacterioses and mycoses<br/>II. Chlamydioses, rickettsioses, and viroses<br/>III. Parasitoses<br/>The books provide a detailed overview of the most important historic and emerging zoonotic diseases, such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, foot-and-mouth disease, influenza, giardiasis, Japanese encephalitis, shigellosis, and spongiform encephalopathies, with information ranging from their first appearance and most important outbreaks to the latest scientific knowledge of the diseases and their causative agents. The chapters provide the following key information on each disease: etiology geographic distribution symptoms and occurrence in man and animals source of infection and mode of transmission role of animals in its epidemiology diagnostic techniques, and prevention and control measures Numerous tables and figures diagramming modes of transmission complement the text.<br/><br/>The book is an essential tool for biologists, parasitologists, virologists, veterinarians, doctors, epidemiologists, and workers in public health and animal health institutions, as well as for teachers, researchers, and students in these fields. All of them will find valuable material to enrich their collection of reference works in the third edition of Zoonoses and communicable diseases common to man and animals.<br/><br/>Volumes 1 (Bacterioses and mycoses) and 2 (Chlamydioses, rickettsioses, and viroses) are also available.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/38/9789275119938.jpg', 'title_long': 'DEFAULT_SET: Zoonoses and Communicable Diseases Common to Man and Animals (Pan American Health Organization)', 'edition': '3', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.2456117803 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.83}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2456117803}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 424, 'date_published': '2003-12-12', 'subjects': ['Law', 'Reference', 'Encyclopedias & Subject Guides', 'Medical', 'Medical Books', 'Administration & Medicine Economics', 'Public Health', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Pan American Health Organization'], 'title': 'DEFAULT_SET: Zoonoses and Communicable Diseases Common to Man and Animals (Pan American Health Organization)', 'isbn13': '9789275119938', 'msrp': 36, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9275119937', 'isbn10': '9275119937'}}
