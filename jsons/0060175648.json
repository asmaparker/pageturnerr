{"book": {"publisher": "Harper", "synopsis": ""Kundera, master of the twosome, finds erotic and existential threads everywhere in daily behavior. Like his previous books, Identity is a cluster of jeweled observations. . . . But Identity has a special charm: suspense. . . . [It] gets us turning the pages in excitement and alarm, and Kundera\"s wit keeps us turning them to the very end." — San Francisco Chronicle<br/>In a narrative as intense as it is brief, a moment of confusion sets in motion a complex chain of events which forces the reader to cross and recross the divide between fantasy and reality.<br/>Sometimes—perhaps only for an instant—we fail to recognize a companion; for a moment their identity ceases to exist, and thus we come to doubt our own. The effect is at its most acute in a couple, where our existence is given meaning by our perception of a lover, and theirs of us.<br/>With his astonishing skill at building on and out from the significant moment, Milan Kundera has placed such a situation and the resulting wave of panic at the core of this novel. Hailed as a 'a fervent and compelling romance, a moving fable about the anxieties of love and separateness' (Baltimore Sun), it is not to be missed.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/56/41/9780060175641.jpg", "title_long": "Identity: A Novel", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.73}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "1998-04-21", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'Women's Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Milan Kundera'], 'title": "Identity: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780060175641", "msrp": 23, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0060175648", "isbn10": "0060175648"}}
