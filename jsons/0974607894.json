{"book": {"publisher": "Melville House", "synopsis": ""The great thing is to lead a normal life, and not be the slave of your passions. What do you get if not?"<br/><br/>One of Russian literature\"s most renowned love storiesâ€”a vivid and sensitive account of adolescent love, wherein the sixteen year old protagonist falls in love with a beautiful but older woman living next door, thereby plunging into a whirlwind of changing emotions that are heightened by her capriciousness, and leading to a truly heart-rending revelation.<br/><br/>The Art of The Novella Series<br/><br/>Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature\'s greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/94/9780974607894.jpg", "title_long": "first_love", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.30644254418 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.30644254418}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2009", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["ivan-turgenev'], 'title": "first_love", "isbn13": "9780974607894", "msrp": 9, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1612192408"}, "isbn": "0974607894", "isbn10": "0974607894", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781612192406", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
