{"book": {"publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "synopsis": "This is a study of how sex and sexuality were written about in the first centuries of this era, a central period in the history of sexuality. Writing with the same wit and verve as the ancient writers he engages with, Simon Goldhill shows how the standard accounts of sexuality in this period are distorted by ignoring the sexy, ironic and often bizarre texts of the ancient novel, erotic poetry and humorous dialogues.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/49/9780521479349.jpg", "title_long": "Foucault"s Virginity: Ancient Erotic Fiction and the History of Sexuality (The W.
