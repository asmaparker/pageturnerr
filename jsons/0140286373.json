{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": ""The "spell" of the title is both the power of drugs, at the heart of the book, and the 'sex-magic' that variously possesses - but then deserts - each of its main characters.' -- The Guardian<br/><br/>Discover this ‘sparkling celebration of sexual intrigue’ (Telegraph, London) from the Booker Prize-winning author of The Line of Beauty.<br/><br/>The Spell is a comedy of sexual manners that follows the interlocking affairs of four men: Robin, an architect in his late forties, who is trying to build an idyllic life in Dorset with his younger lover, Justin; Robin\'s 22 year old son Danny, a volatile beauty who lives for clubbing and casual sex; and the shy Alex, who is Justin\'s ex-boyfriend.<br/><br/>As each in turn falls under the spell of romance or drugs, country living or rough trade, a richly ironic picture emerges of the clashing imperatives of modern gay life. At once lyrical, sceptical and romantic, The Spell confirms Alan Hollinghurst as one of Britain\'s most important novelists.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/63/73/9780140286373.jpg", "title_long": "The Spell", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.78 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.52}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.78}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2000-05-01", "subjects": ["LGBTQ+ Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'British & Irish', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Alan Hollinghurst'], 'title": "The Spell", "isbn13": "9780140286373", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1440621535"}, "isbn": "0140286373", "isbn10": "0140286373", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781440621536", "binding": "print"}]}}
