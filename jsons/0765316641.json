{"book": {"publisher": "Tor Books", "synopsis": "Latro forgets everything when he sleeps. Writing down his experiences every day and reading his journal anew each morning gives him a poignantly tenuous hold on himself, but his story"s hold on readers is powerful indeed. The two previous novels, combined in Latro in the Mist (Soldier of the Mist and Soldier of Arete) are generally considered classics of contemporary fantasy.<br/><br/>Latro now finds himself in Egypt, a land of singing girls, of spiteful and conniving deities. Without his memory, his is unsure of everything, except for his desire to be free of the curse that causes him to forget. The visions Gene Wolfe conjures, of the wonders of Egypt, and of the adventures of Latro as he and his companions journey up the great Nile south into unknown or legendary territory, are unique and compelling. Soldier of Sidon is a thrilling and magical fantasy novel, and yet another masterpiece from Gene Wolfe.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/46/9780765316646.jpg", "title_long": "Soldier of Sidon", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2006-10-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Historical'], 'authors": ['Gene Wolfe'], 'title": "Soldier of Sidon", "isbn13": "9780765316646", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0765316641", "isbn10": "0765316641"}}
