He remains today as a sort of trademark for all that is finest in American imaginative fiction."<br/>--Stephen King<br/><br/>Electronics engineer Dan Davis has finally made the invention of a lifetime: a household robot with extraordinary abilities, destined to dramatically change the landscape of everyday routine. Then, with wild success just within reach, Dan\'s greedy partner and greedier fianc√©e trick him into taking the long sleep--suspended animation for thirty years. They never imagine that the future time in which Dan will awaken has mastered time travel, giving him a way to get back to them--and at them . . .<br/><br/>Once again, the author of Stranger in a Strange Land and Starship Troopers displays his genius. The Door in to Summer proves why Robert Heinlein\'s books have sold more than 50 million copies, winning countless awards, and earning him the title of Grand Master of Science Fiction.<br/><br/>'Heinlein . . . has the ability to see technologies just around the bend.
