{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "‘It is best to do nothing! The best thing is conscious inertia! So long live the underground!’Alienated from society and paralysed by a sense of his own insignificance, the anonymous narrator of Dostoyevsky’s groundbreaking Notes from Underground tells the story of his tortured life. With bitter sarcasm, he describes his refusal to become a worker in the ‘ant-hill’ of society and his gradual withdrawal to an existence ‘underground’. The seemingly ordinary world of St Petersburg takes on a nightmarish quality in The Double when a government clerk encounters a man who exactly resembles him – his double perhaps, or possibly the darker side of his own personality. Like Notes from Underground, this is a masterly study of human consciousness.Jessie Coulson’s introduction discusses the stories’ critical reception and the themes they share with Dostoyevksy’s great novels.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/25/26/9780140442526.jpg", "title_long": "Notes from Underground; the Double (Penguin Classics)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.8 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.71 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.71}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.50044933474}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.8}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "1972-07-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors": ["Fyodor Dostoyevsky'], 'title": "Notes from Underground; the Double (Penguin Classics)", "isbn13": "9780140442526", "msrp": 15, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140442529", "isbn10": "0140442529"}}
