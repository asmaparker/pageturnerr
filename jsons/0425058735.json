{"book": {"publisher": "Berkley Trade", "synopsis": "The Elder Isles, located in what is now the Bay of Biscay off the the coast of Old Gaul, are made up of ten contending kingdoms, all vying with each other for control. At the centre of much of the intrigue is Casmir, the ruthless and ambitious king of Lyonesse. His beautiful but otherworldly daughter, Suldrun, is part of his plans. He intends to cement an alliance or two by marrying her well. But Suldrun is as determined as he and defies him. Casmir coldly confines her to the overgrown garden that she loves to frequent, and it is here that meets her love and her tragedy unfolds. Political intrigue, magic, war, adventure and romance are interwoven in a rich and sweeping tale set in a brilliantly realized fabled land.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/32/9780425058732.jpg", "title_long": "Lyonesse: Book 1 - Suldrun"s Garden", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 5 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}}, "pages": 436, "date_published": "1983-04-01", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic'], 'authors": ["Jack Vance'], 'title": "Lyonesse: Book 1 - Suldrun"s Garden", 'isbn13": "9780425058732", "msrp": 6.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0425058735", "isbn10": "0425058735"}}
