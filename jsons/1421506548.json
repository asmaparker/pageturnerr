In the 1880s, Englishman Jonathan Joestar gave his life to defeat Dio, a megalomaniacal vampire. Now, 100 years later, Dio is back, and Jonathan\"s descendants must travel to Egypt to destroy their ancestral enemy once and for all.<br/><br/>Pursued by the deadly treads of "Wheel of Fortune," the heroes cross from India to Pakistan, where they spend the night in an ancient, fog-shrouded town. But little do they know that they have walked into the hands of their enemy...the twin right hands of Enyaba Geil, who wants bloody revenge on the men who killed her son! Invaded by Enyaba\'s stand 'Justice,' the heroes\' own bodies turn against them, while an army of zombies slouches closer. Will they escape...or will they be dead by dawn?', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/48/9781421506548.jpg", "title_long": "JoJo"s Bizarre Adventure: Part 3--Stardust Crusaders (Single Volume Edition), Vol. 5: City of Death (5)", 'edition": "1st", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2006", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Media Tie-In', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Hirohiko Araki'], 'title": "JoJo"s Bizarre Adventure: Part 3--Stardust Crusaders (Single Volume Edition), Vol. 5: City of Death (5)", 'isbn13": "9781421506548", "msrp": 9.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1421506548", "isbn10": "1421506548"}}
