{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': 'A beautiful and affecting novel -- bittersweet and comic -- on the elusive nature of happiness<br/>Maggie is in her early thirties, gainfully employed, between relationships, and ready for change -- although not in the ways or to the degree that unfolds in Anne Giardini\'s The Sad Truth About Happiness.<br/>Maggie\'s roommate, Rebecca, devises questionnaires for women\'s magazines, and she is convinced her newest quiz can predict the exact date of death of anyone who answers the questions honestly. When Maggie tries the test, she learns that she is scheduled to die before her next birthday -- the fact that she has answered "No" to the question "Are you happy?" appears to have shaved decades off her life. Only if Maggie can become happy in her three remaining months can she perhaps prevent the prediction from coming true.<br/>With wry comedy, Maggie\'s life becomes considerably more complicated from that very moment, since her quest for happiness attracts both admirers and challenges. The true test comes when, through a mad tangle of circumstance, Maggie finds herself on the run with her sister Lucy\'s newborn son. The often unexpected power of friendships and family, the universal pull toward a home, and a more intense relationship with the world all leave Maggie and the reader with a new awareness of the evanescent joys of happiness, which we all long for, but can seldom seek directly or hold for longer than an instant.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/61/9780060741761.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Sad Truth About Happiness: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.625 Inches, Weight: 0.99 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.625}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.99}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2005-04-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States'], 'authors': ['Anne Giardini'], 'title': 'The Sad Truth About Happiness: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060741761', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060741767', 'isbn10': '0060741767'}}
