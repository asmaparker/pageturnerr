{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "The destruction of the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the attack on the Pentagon -- all within one hour on September 11, 2001 -- demonstrated America's shocking vulnerability to terrorism.<br/>Yet terror had already emerged on America's shores eight years earlier, when the mysterious terrorist mastermind, Ramzi Yousef (arrested after a botched attempt to down a dozen U.S. airlines) bombed the World Trade Center in an attempt to fell the buildings. His attacks were viewed as the harbinger of a new terrorism, carried out by an elusive enemy driven by religious fanaticism to unprecedented hatred of the United States.<br/>But is that perception accurate? A real-life detective story, The War Against America engages the reader in a gripping examination of the evidence regarding Yousef and his terrorism. It reveals the split between New York and Washington that emerged during the investigation and tells a terrifying tale of America left exposed and vulnerable following the mishandling of what was once the most ambitious terrorist attack ever attempted on U.S. soil.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/14/9780060097714.jpg', 'title_long': 'The War Against America: Saddam Hussein and the World Trade Center Attacks: A Study of Revenge', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1243575362 Pounds, Width: 0.792793 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.792793}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1243575362}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['History', 'Middle East', 'Military', 'World', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Science & Math', 'Technology', 'History of Technology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Laurie Mylroie'], 'title': 'The War Against America: Saddam Hussein and the World Trade Center Attacks: A Study of Revenge', 'isbn13': '9780060097714', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0062032615', 'ePub': '0062032615'}, 'isbn': '006009771X', 'isbn10': '006009771X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062032614', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
