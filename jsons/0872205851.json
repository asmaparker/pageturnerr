{"book": {"publisher": "Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.", "synopsis": "This volume offers the fruits of Peter Meineck and Paul Woodruff"s dynamic collaboration on the plays of Sophocles" Theban cycle, presenting the translators" Oedipus Tyrannus (2000) along with Woodruff's Antigone (2001) and a muscular new Oedipus at Colonus by Meineck. Grippingly readable, all three translations combine fidelity to the Greek with concision, clarity, and powerful, hard-edged speech. Each play features foot-of-the-page notes, stage directions, and line numbers to the Greek. Woodruff's Introduction discusses the playwright, Athenian theatre and performance, the composition of the plays, and the plots and characters of each; it also offers thoughtful reflections on major critical interpretations of these plays.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/57/9780872205857.jpg", "title_long": "Theban Plays (Hackett Classics)", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.50044933474}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2003-03-15", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Ancient & Classical', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Movements & Periods', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Sophocles'], 'title": "Theban Plays (Hackett Classics)", "isbn13": "9780872205857", "msrp": 10.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "1603846913", "ePub": "160384726X"}, "isbn": "0872205851", "isbn10": "0872205851", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781603846912", "binding": "print"}, {"isbn": "9781603847261", "binding": "print"}]}}
