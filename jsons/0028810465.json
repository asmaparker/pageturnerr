{'book': {'publisher': 'Potomac Books Inc', 'synopsis': "In Hollow Victory, iconoclastic defense analyst Jeffrey Record targets the conventional view of the Gulf War victory. In his characteristically provocative style, he answers controversial political, military, and strategic questions raised by the war and its aftermath, among them: Were the UN economic sanctions ever really given a chance to work? Could the war have been avoided altogether? Why were assessments of Iraqi strengths and weaknesses so inaccurate? How did the war's operational setting contribute to its outcome? Could a better general than Saddam Hussein have derailed Operation Desert Storm? What were the relative contributions of air, ground, and naval power? Did air power win the war? Were U.S. military planning and operations really free of meddling by civilian authorities? Did the U.S. armed services work together harmoniously?<br/>If you thought you understood what happened in Desert Storm, Hollow Victory will challenge your conclusions.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/61/9780028810461.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hollow Victory: A Contrary View of the Gulf War', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.00089866948}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '1993', 'subjects': ['History', 'World'], 'authors': ['Jeffrey Record'], 'title': 'Hollow Victory: A Contrary View of the Gulf War', 'isbn13': '9780028810461', 'msrp': 23, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0028810465', 'isbn10': '0028810465'}}
