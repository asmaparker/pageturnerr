{'book': {'publisher': 'The Chinese University of Hong Kong Press', 'synopsis': "?Iron Ox contains chapters 63-90 of the original and can be divided into four main sections. The first of these is very much concerned with the question of the leadership on Mount Liang. Iron Ox is prominent in the second section, probably the most varied and entertaining part of this volume. The third section is concerned with the count's various attempts to subdue Mount Liang by force or win them over with an amnesty. The fourth section begins with the granting of the amnesty and the first campaign in the Emperor's service against the Liao Tartars. This part ends with an encounter which foreshadows the campaign against Tian Hu in Volume 5, The Scattered Flock.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/98/9789622019898.jpg', 'title_long': 'Iron Ox: Part Four of The Marshes of Mount Liang', 'edition': 1, 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.92 Inches, Length: 6.16 Inches, Weight: 3.31354779786 Pounds, Width: 1.02 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.16}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.02}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.31354779786}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.92}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2003-01-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies'], 'authors': ['Guanzhong Luo', "Nai'an Shi"], 'title': 'Iron Ox: Part Four of The Marshes of Mount Liang', 'isbn13': '9789622019898', 'msrp': 23, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9622019897', 'isbn10': '9622019897'}}
