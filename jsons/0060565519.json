She is jarred out of the routine of her life by a seemingly chance meeting with a young man named Zedrick Dewe, whom she seems to know somehow as he in turn seems to know her. What is the connection between them? Who has brought them together? And why are they drawn so powerfully to one another? Their encounter leads to a highly charged erotic experience that takes an abrupt turn from tender to violent, predictable to terrifying. And from this initial episode springs a sequence of inexplicable events and revelations so shocking that they lead Lara, long in denial about her life, to uncover the truth about the buried hurt and rage in the tortured past of her family.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/10/9780060565510.jpg', 'title_long': 'Take Me, Take Me with You: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.91 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.91}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2004-04-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Lauren Kelly'], 'title': 'Take Me, Take Me with You: A Novel of Suspense', 'isbn13': '9780060565510', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060565519', 'isbn10': '0060565519'}}
