{'book': {'publisher': 'Unwin Hyman', 'synopsis': 'Originally published in 1987 Not Only the Poor explores the self-interested involvement of the non-poor in the welfare state, particularly the middle class. Using evidence from Britain, America, and Australia, they show that the non-poor were crucial in the founding of the welfare state, and in all three countries the non-poor benefit extensively from key welfare programmes, including those ostensibly targeted on the poor. Goodin and Le Grand conclude that the beneficial involvement of the non-poor in the welfare state is probably inevitable, but this may be no bad thing, depending on the alternative and on the nature of the egalitarian ideal adopted.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/41/9780043360941.jpg', 'title_long': 'Not Only the Poor: The Middle Classes and the Welfare State', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.04940036712 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04940036712}}, 'pages': 251, 'date_published': '1987', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government'], 'authors': ['Robert E.
