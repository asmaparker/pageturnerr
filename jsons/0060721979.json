{'book': {'publisher': 'Eos', 'synopsis': "Andrea Mitchell has never felt as if she belongs in the 21st century. She's too fat, too clumsy, and too plain. So when she's offered the chance to take the Time Tube back to the 16th century -- and back to Per, the young Sterkarm warrior she fell in love with once before -- she doesn't hesitate. The lovely, boisterous, and crude Sterkarms have always made her feel welcome and at home. Maybe this time she'll even stay for good.<br/>But things on the 16th side are not what Andrea expected them to be. Per doesn't know who she is, and a wedding between the Sterkarms and their enemies, the Grannams, ends in bloodshed and confusion. Even when Andrea discovers it's the Elves who have betrayed them all, no one wants to believe her. She may have made the biggest -- and the deadliest -- mistake of her life.<br/>In this blistering sequel to her award-winning the sterkarm handshake, Susan Price weaves a riveting tale of revenge, deceit, and love, set against a backdrop of warring clans and brutal passions.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/78/9780060721978.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Sterkarm Kiss', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2004-10-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Fairy Tales, Folk Tales & Myths', 'Other', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Susan Price'], 'title': 'A Sterkarm Kiss', 'isbn13': '9780060721978', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060721979', 'isbn10': '0060721979'}}
