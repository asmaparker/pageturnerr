{"book": {"publisher": "McSweeney"s", "synopsis": "McSweeney"s Issue 19, our first issue of 2006, turns toward earlier and equally uncertain years, traveling back by way of pamphlets, info-cards, and letters addressing bygone conflicts and still-constant concerns. Expect, among other recovered works, carefree strategies for insurgencies in Nicaragua, astrological advice for the Nixon/Agnew campaigner, sanguine guidance for the soldier stationed in the Middle East at mid-century, and commonsense reinforcement for the doughboy drifting toward a gonorrhea infection. Also featured is T.C. Boyle"s feral child novella and additional quasi-historical work by new writers.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/80/9781932416480.jpg", "title_long": "McSweeney"s Issue 19", 'edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.3125 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.3125}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 250, "date_published": "2006-04-10", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Action & Adventure', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Contemporary', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors": [], 'title": "McSweeney"s Issue 19", 'isbn13": "9781932416480", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "193241648X", "isbn10": "193241648X"}}
