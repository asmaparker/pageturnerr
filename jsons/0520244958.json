{"book": {"publisher": "University of California Press", "synopsis": "This compelling account of a wronged woman in Renaissance Florence, first published in 1986, is a fascinating view of Florentine society and its attitudes on love, marriage, class, and gender. Lusanna was a beautiful woman from a middle-class background who, in 1455, brought suit against Giovanni, her aristocratic lover, when she learned he had contracted to marry a woman of his own class. Blending scholarship with insightful narrative, the book portrays an extraordinary woman who challenged the unwritten codes and barriers of the social hierarchy and dared to seek a measure of personal independence in a male-dominated world.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/55/9780520244955.jpg", "title_long": "Giovanni and Lusanna: Love and Marriage in Renaissance Florence", "edition": "First Edition, With a New Preface", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.06834330122 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.06834330122}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 160, "date_published": "2004-12-14", "subjects": ["History', 'Europe', 'Italy', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Marriage & Family'], 'authors": ["Gene Brucker'], 'title": "Giovanni and Lusanna: Love and Marriage in Renaissance Florence", "isbn13": "9780520244955", "msrp": 20.25, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0520244958", "isbn10": "0520244958"}}
