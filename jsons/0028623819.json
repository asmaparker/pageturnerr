{'book': {'publisher': 'Collins Reference', 'synopsis': "In the United States, 20 percent of the adult population is marginally literate. Of these roughly 30 million people, approximately 1.8 million are enrolled in basic skills literacy programs. Webster's New World has created a dictionary that is uniquely designed to help these beginning readers.<br/><br/>Webster's New World Basic Dictionary of American English defines 49,000 of the most commonly used words in the American English lexicon. These are the words adult readers are most likely to encounter in newspapers and magazines, on job applications and product instructions, on advertising billboards and their children's school progress reports. The dictionary defines these words in clear, easy-to-understand language, using only words that are themselves defined in the dictionary, but never condescending to the adult reader. Definitions are liberally supplemented with example phrases and sentences that put words in context and help new readers understand meaning and usage. Special notes on synonyms help new readers differentiate between words with similar meanings. And selected illustrations help readers identify and remember words.<br/><br/>This quality paperback book is designed for ease of reading and use, as well as for durability. Primarily created for native English speakers, it is also a valuable reference for more advanced readers of English as a second language. From the editors of the prestigious Webster's New World College Dictionary, the Basic Dictionary of American English brings the full scholarship behind that work to this important new offering in the field of literacy.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/18/9780028623818.jpg', 'title_long': "Webster's New World Basic Dictionary Of American English", 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 3.00269600844 Pounds, Width: 1.9 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.9}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.00269600844}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 1056, 'date_published': '1998-08-04', 'subjects': ['Reference', 'Dictionaries & Thesauruses', 'Dictionaries', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Foreign Language Dictionaries & Thesauruses', 'English as a Second Language'], 'authors': ["The Editors of the Webster's New Wo", "Staff of Webster's New World Dictio"], 'title': "Webster's New World Basic Dictionary Of American English", 'isbn13': '9780028623818', 'msrp': 12.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0028623819', 'isbn10': '0028623819'}}
