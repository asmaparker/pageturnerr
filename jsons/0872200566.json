{"book": {"publisher": "Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.", "synopsis": ". . . eminently readable . . . admirably picks up the spirit of what Hegel is saying. . . . more readable and accurate than Hartmann"s, and it translates a more readable text than does Nisbet"s. It includes (as Hartmann"s does not) an excerpt, which serves as chapter five, from 'The Geographical Basis of History' (particularly interesting for what it says of America), and a brief chapter six, entitled 'The Division of History.' The volume closes with an appendix, translating §§341–360 of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right and deals directly with the very concept of 'World History.' It constitutes a big help in coming to grips with what Hegel means by 'Spirit.' --Quentin Lauer, SJ, Fordham University, in International Philosophical Quarterly', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/62/9780872200562.jpg", "title_long": "Introduction to the Philosophy of History: with selections from The Philosophy of Right (Hackett Classics)", "edition": "UK ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.25132697868 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.25132697868}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 106, "date_published": "1988-06-01", "subjects": ["Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Modern', 'Political', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'], 'title": "Introduction to the Philosophy of History: with selections from The Philosophy of Right (Hackett Classics)", "isbn13": "9780872200562", "msrp": 14.5, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1603847073", "eBook": "160384709X", "ePub": "1603847073"}, "isbn": "0872200566", "isbn10": "0872200566", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781603847070", "binding": "print"}, {"isbn": "9781603847094", "binding": "print"}]}}
