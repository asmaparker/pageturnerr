Nollop was named after Nevin Nollop, author of the immortal phrase containing all the letters of the alphabet, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”<br/><br/>Now Ella finds herself acting to save her friends, family, and fellow citizens from the encroaching totalitarianism of the island’s Council, which has banned the use of certain letters of the alphabet as they fall from a memorial statue of Nevin Nollop. As the letters progressively drop from the statue they also disappear from the novel. The result is "a love letter to alphabetarians and logomaniacs everywhere" (Myla Goldberg, bestselling author of Bee Season).", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/38/9780385722438.jpg", "title_long": "Ella Minnow Pea: A Novel in Letters", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.44974301448 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.16}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.59}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44974301448}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.97}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2002-09-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'Epistolary', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Mark Dunn'], 'title": "Ella Minnow Pea: A Novel in Letters", "isbn13": "9780385722438", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101911778"}, "isbn": "0385722435", "isbn10": "0385722435", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101911778", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
