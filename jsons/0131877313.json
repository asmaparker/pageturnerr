{'book': {'publisher': 'Ft Press', 'synopsis': 'By 2015, China may well have the world\'s largest economy. In The Chinese Century, Oded Shenkar shows how China is restoring its imperial glory by infusing modern technology and market economics into a non-democratic system controlled by the Communist party and bureaucracy. Shenkar shows why China\'s quest for global success differs radically from predecessors such as Japan, India, and Mexico... why it represents a fundamental restructuring of the global business system... and why it will transform the roles of participants in the global economy. He previews tomorrow\'s new competitive ground rules, terms of employment, and consumption patterns, and shows how Chinese ascendancy is redrawing political, economic, and social battle lines. Learn why the U.S. is most vulnerable to China\'s ascent... how China\'s disregard for intellectual property creates sustainable competitive advantage... how China\'s growth impacts global businesses and individual purchasing decisions. Above all, Shenkar shows what you must do to survive and prosper in "The Chinese Century."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/13/9780131877313.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Chinese Century: The Rising Chinese Economy and Its Impact on the Global Economy, the Balance of Power, and Your Job', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.9 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 0.5070632026 Pounds, Width: 0.51 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.51}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5070632026}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.9}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2004-10-13', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'International'], 'authors': ['Oded Shenkar'], 'title': 'The Chinese Century: The Rising Chinese Economy and Its Impact on the Global Economy, the Balance of Power, and Your Job', 'isbn13': '9780131877313', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0132716143'}, 'isbn': '0131877313', 'isbn10': '0131877313', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780132716147', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
