{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Belle Cantrell felt guilty about killing her husband and she hated that. Feeling guilty, that is. A lady shouldn\'t do something she\'s going to feel guilty about later, was a rule Belle kept firmly in mind.<br/>So begins The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell, a story of murder, adultery, and regular church attendance, which introduces Belle Cantrell as a beautiful young widow with a rebellious streak, years before she will become grandmother to Sissy LeBlanc, the feisty main character of Loraine Despres\'s bestselling The Scandalous Summer of Sissy LeBlanc.<br/>The year is 1920, prohibition is in full swing, women are clamoring for the vote, and a narrow-minded intolerance is on the rise. Life isn\'t easy for an unmarried woman, not in a little town like Gentry, Louisiana, especially after she\'s sent to jail for swimming in an indecent bathing costume with a group of suffragists.<br/>It\'s not as if Belle doesn\'t know how to behave. She knows the rules. She keeps the Primer of Propriety firmly in mind. But sometimes -- most of the time -- she has to twist the rules a little, or break them, or give them a permanent kink, because they all say the same thing: "Don\'t."<br/>And a girl has got to live.<br/>After a year and a half of mourning, Belle decides to get on with her life and kicks off a season of tumult that will change her and Gentry forever.<br/>Sexy, sassy, with laugh-out-loud humor and a cast of zany characters you won\'t forget, The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell is a big comic love story and a page-turner. But it delves deeper, as Belle struggles to find her moral center and stand up to forces that are determined to destroy the soul of a town and the people she loves.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/49/9780060515249.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.13}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2005-09-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Loraine Despres'], 'title': 'The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060515249', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060515244', 'isbn10': '0060515244'}}
