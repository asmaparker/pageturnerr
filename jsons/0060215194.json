{'book': {'publisher': 'Amistad', 'synopsis': "When Langston Hughes was a boy, His grandmother told him true stories of how African people were captured in Africa and brought to America enslaved. She told him about their fight for freedom and justice.<br/>Langston loved his grandmother's stories. To learn more stories and bear more beautiful language, he began to read books. He fell in love with books and decided that one day he would write stories too, true stories about Black people.<br/>When he was only fourteen, Langston wrote his first poem, and for the rest of his life he was always writing -- stories and essays and, most of all, poems. He wrote about Black people as he saw them: happy, sad, mad, and beautiful. Through his writing he fought for freedom from inequality and injustice; and his gift of words inspired and influenced many other writers.<br/>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker was one writer Langston influenced. In this moving and richly detailed portrait she celebrates the life of an extraordinary man. Accompanied by stunning paintings by artist Catherine Deeter, Langston Hughes: American Poet will introduce a whole new generation to the life and works of a great African American Poet of the twentieth century, and one of the most important poets of all time.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/94/9780060215194.jpg', 'title_long': 'Langston Hughes: American Poet', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8.75 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 0.36 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.36}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 48, 'date_published': '2001-12-24', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Biographies', 'Literary', 'Multicultural'], 'authors': ['Alice Walker'], 'title': 'Langston Hughes: American Poet', 'isbn13': '9780060215194', 'msrp': 16.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0060215194', 'isbn10': '0060215194'}}
