Cloaked in the protection of their sorcery, they move with no fear of the vagrants and miscreants who despise them and their workâ€”until one enraged girl, barely more than a child, hurls a stone at the hated invaders . . . and effortlessly penetrates their magical shield.<br/>What the Magicians\' Guild has long dreaded has finally come to pass. There is someone outside their ranks who possesses a raw power beyond imagining, an untrained mage who must be found and schooled before she destroys herself and her city with a force she cannot yet control.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/81/9780060575281.jpg', 'title_long': "The Magicians' Guild (The Black Magician Trilogy, Book 1) (Black Magician Trilogy, 1)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Coming of Age', 'Myths & Legends', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure'], 'authors': ['Trudi Canavan'], 'title': "The Magicians' Guild (The Black Magician Trilogy, Book 1) (Black Magician Trilogy, 1)", 'isbn13': '9780060575281', 'msrp': 3.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061797677', 'ePub': '0061797677'}, 'isbn': '006057528X', 'isbn10': '006057528X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061797675', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
