They looked alike in every way . . . but no one ever expected Delia to be the one to get into trouble . . .<br/>How did this young lady"s reputation become so questionable?<br/>Once she was lovely, respectable Miss Delia Effington, but an impulsive decision—and subsequent disaster—forces Delia to retire from society. Until one night, desperate for diversion, she attends a ball as her twin sister and finds herself dancing in the strong arms of the dashing Viscount St. Stephens.<br/>Delia believes she has never met this man who arouses her passions, yet he seems somehow familiar. For Delia doesn"t know that St. Stephens, an agent for the Crown, has been in her home, protecting her under the disguise of her butler.
