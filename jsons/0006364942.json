{'book': {'publisher': 'Fontana', 'synopsis': "The second volume of Helen Forrester's powerful, painful and ultimately uplifting four-volume autobiography of her poverty-stricken childhood in Liverpool during the Depression. The Forrester family are slowly winning their fight for survival. But fourteen-year-old Helen's personal battle is to persuade her parents to allow her to earn her own living, to lead her own life after the years of neglect and inadequate schooling while she cared for her six younger brothers and sisters. Her untiring struggles against illness caused by severe malnutrition and dirt (she has her first bath in four years) and, above all, the selfish demands of her parents, make this a story of amazing courage and perseverance.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/48/9780006364948.jpg', 'title_long': 'Liverpool Miss', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.37007 Inches, Weight: 0.4078551847 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.37007}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7874}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4078551847}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.00786}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1982', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs'], 'authors': ['Helen Forrester'], 'title': 'Liverpool Miss', 'isbn13': '9780006364948', 'msrp': 12.4, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0006364942', 'isbn10': '0006364942'}}
