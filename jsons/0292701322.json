{"book": {"publisher": "University of Texas Press", "synopsis": "A major figure in the history of post-Revolutionary literature in Mexico, Juan Rulfo received international acclaim for his brilliant short novel Pedro PÃ¡ramo (1955) and his collection of short stories El llano en llamas (1953), translated as a collection here in English for the first time. In the transition of Mexican fiction from direct statements of nationalism and social protest to a concentration on cosmopolitanism, the works of Rulfo hold a unique position. These stories of a rural people caught in the play of natural forces are not simply an interior examination of the phenomena of their world; they are written for the larger purpose of showing the actions of humans in broad terms of reality.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/28/9780292701328.jpg", "title_long": "The Burning Plain and Other Stories", "edition": "New", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 175, "date_published": "1971-06-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories'], 'authors": ["Juan Rulfo'], 'title": "The Burning Plain and Other Stories", "isbn13": "9780292701328", "msrp": 17.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0292701322", "isbn10": "0292701322"}}
