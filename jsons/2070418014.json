{"book": {"publisher": "Gallimard", "synopsis": "La Bete humaine (1890), the seventeenth novel in the Rougon-Macquart series, is one of Zola"s most violent and explicit works. On one level a tale of murder, passion, and possession, it is also a compassionate study of individuals derailed by atavistic forces beyond their control. This new translation captures Zola"s fast-paced yet deliberately dispassionate style, while the introduction and detailed notes place the novel in its social, historical, and literary context.<br/>About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World"s Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.
