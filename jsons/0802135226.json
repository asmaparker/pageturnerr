{"book": {"publisher": "Grove Press", "synopsis": ""Winterson is a master of her material, a writer in whom great talent deeply abides." — Vanity Fair<br/>First published to great acclaim in 1987, this arresting, elegant novel from Jeanette Winterson uses Napolean’s Europe as the setting for a tantalizing surrealistic romance between an observer of history and a creature of fantasy. Jeanette Winterson’s novels have established her as one of the most important young writers in world literature. The Passion is perhaps her most highly acclaimed work, a modern classic that confirms her special claim on the novel. Set during the tumultuous years of the Napoleonic Wars, The Passion intertwines the destinies of two remarkable people: Henri, a simple French soldier, who follows Napoleon from glory to Russian ruin; and Villanelle, the red-haired, web-footed daughter of a Venetian boatman, whose husband has gambled away her heart. In Venice’s compound of carnival, chance, and darkness, the pair meet their singular destiny.<br/><br/>In her unique and mesmerizing voice, Winterson blends reality with fantasy, dream, and imagination to weave a hypnotic tale with stunning effects.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/23/9780802135223.jpg", "title_long": "The Passion", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.44974301448 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44974301448}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "1997-08-07", "subjects": ["LGBTQ+ Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'British & Irish', 'Literary', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Jeanette Winterson'], 'title": "The Passion", "isbn13": "9780802135223", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0802198716"}, "isbn": "0802135226", "isbn10": "0802135226", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780802198716", "binding": "print"}]}}
