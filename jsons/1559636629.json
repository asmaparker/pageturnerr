{"book": {"publisher": "Island Press", "synopsis": "Humans are terrestrial animals, and our capacity to see and understand the importance and vulnerability of life in the sea has trailed our growing ability to harm it. While conservation biologists are working to address environmental problems humans have created on land, loss of marine biodiversity, including extinctions and habitat degradation, has received much less attention. At the same time, marine sciences such as oceanography and fisheries biology have largely ignored issues of conservation.<br/>Marine Conservation Biology brings together for the first time in a single volume, leading experts from around the world to apply the lessons and thinking of conservation biology to marine issues. Contributors including James M. Acheson, Louis W. Botsford, James T. Carlton, Kristina Gjerde, Selina S. Heppell, Ransom A. Myers, Julia K. Parrish, Stephen R. Palumbi, and Daniel Pauly offer penetrating insights on the nature of marine biodiversity, what threatens it, and what humans can and must do to recover the biological integrity of the world"s estuaries, coastal seas, and oceans.<br/>Sections examine: distinctive aspects of marine populations and ecosystems; threats to marine biological diversity, singly and in combination; place-based management of marine ecosystems; the often-neglected human dimensions of marine conservation.<br/>Marine Conservation Biology breaks new ground by creating the conceptual framework for the new field of marine conservation biology -- the science of protecting, recovering, and sustainably using the living sea. It synthesizes the latest knowledge and ideas from leading thinkers in disciplines ranging from larval biology to sociology, making it a must-read for research and teaching faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate and advanced undergraduate students (who share an interest in bringing conservation biology to marine issues). Likewise, its lucid scientific examinations illuminate key issues facing environmental managers, policymakers, advocates, and funders concerned with the health of our oceans.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/29/9781559636629.jpg", "title_long": "Marine Conservation Biology: The Science of Maintaining the Sea"s Biodiversity", 'edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 2.4 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.9}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10}}, "pages": 496, "date_published": "2005-05-09", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Oceans & Seas', 'Conservation', 'Environment', 'Environmentalism', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ['Marine Conservation Biology Institute'], 'title": "Marine Conservation Biology: The Science of Maintaining the Sea"s Biodiversity", 'isbn13": "9781559636629", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1559636629", "isbn10": "1559636629"}}
