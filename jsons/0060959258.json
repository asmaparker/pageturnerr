{'book': {'publisher': 'HarpPeren', 'synopsis': 'John Connoly and James "Whitey" Bulger grew up together on the streets of South Boston. Decades later, in the mid 1970\'s, they would meet again. By then, Connolly was a major figure in the FBI\'s Boston office and Whitey had become godfather of the Irish Mob. What happened next -- a dirty deal to being down the Italian mob in exchange for protection for Bulger -- would spiral out of control, leading to murders, drug dealing, racketeering indictments, and, ultimately, the biggest informant scandal in the history of the FBI.<br/>Compellingly told by two Boston Globe reporters who were on the case from the beginning, Black Mass is at once a riveting crime story, a cautionary tale about the abuse of power, and a penetrating look at Boston and its Irish population.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/58/9780060959258.jpg', 'title_long': 'Black Mass', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.73 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.73}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 424, 'date_published': '2001-05-22', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Law', 'Criminal Law', 'Law Enforcement', 'Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Dick Lehr', "Gerard O'Neill"], 'title': 'Black Mass', 'isbn13': '9780060959258', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060959258', 'isbn10': '0060959258'}}
