A wild sci-fi police comedy set in a future where the norms are vast, bio-constructed cities, air so foul that citizens must wear masks outside, and a police department that includes a squad of crack tank police! Join Leona, her pet tank Bonaparte, and her lovesick partner Al as they confront the villainous Buaku and his felinoid accessories-to-crime. Leona`s goal: to rescue Crolis, a mysterious green-skinned girl with the power to cleanse the air around her, and the potential to renew the poisoned earth. Added to this edition are Phantom of the Audience, a 1994 Dominion one-shot never before collected in the U.S., and an all-new cover!", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/81/9781569714881.jpg", "title_long": "Dominion: Tank Police", "edition": "3rd", "dimensions": "Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.25}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2000-04-19", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Science Fiction', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse'], 'authors": ["Masamune Shirow'], 'title": "Dominion: Tank Police", "isbn13": "9781569714881", "msrp": 16.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1569714886", "isbn10": "1569714886"}}
