{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "Meet John Gullivan, age thirteen, obsessed with the moles that dot most of his body. Meet his brother Gully, who can't stop laughing at them. Now meet the brothers ten years later, in the middle of the most ferocious blizzard anyone can remember. Set in an Irish working-class suburb of Boston in the 1960s and 1970s, Puff centers on a quest as the soon-to-be-orphaned brothers, posing as rescue personnel, attempt to steer their dilapidated van through insurmountable snow, all to score a bag of pot.<br/>Trapped in their own ruse and forced to act the part of the saviors they are pretending to be, the brothers run into an endless stream of foes and obstacles: the cops, their childhood priest, a knife-wielding maniac, and the ill all stand in the way of their elusive high. A raucous caper, Puff is as hilarious as it is heartfelt and will resonate with old and young alike.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/24/9780060751524.jpg', 'title_long': 'Puff: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2005-02-01', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'Family Life', 'Action & Adventure', "Men's Adventure", 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Boys & Men', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Social Issues', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Bob Flaherty'], 'title': 'Puff: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060751524', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061877379'}, 'isbn': '0060751525', 'isbn10': '0060751525', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061877377', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
