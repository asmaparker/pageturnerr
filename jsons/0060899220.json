{"book": {"publisher": "Ecco", "synopsis": "An updated and revised edition of Anthony Bourdain"s mega-bestselling Kitchen Confidential, with new material from the original edition<br/>Almost two decades ago, the New Yorker published a now infamous article, “Don’t Eat before You Read This,” by then little-known chef Anthony Bourdain. Bourdain spared no one’s appetite as he revealed what happens behind the kitchen door. The article was a sensation, and the book it spawned, the now classic Kitchen Confidential, became an even bigger sensation, a megabestseller with over one million copies in print. Frankly confessional, addictively acerbic, and utterly unsparing, Bourdain pulls no punches in this memoir of his years in the restaurant business.<br/>Fans will love to return to this deliciously funny, delectably shocking banquet of wild-but-true tales of life in the culinary trade from Chef Anthony Bourdain, laying out his more than a quarter-century of drugs, sex, and haute cuisine—this time with never-before-published material.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/92/26/9780060899226.jpg", "title_long": "Kitchen Confidential Updated Edition: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (P.S.)", "edition": "Updated", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.79}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.58}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 312, "date_published": "2007-01-09", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Rich & Famous', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Culinary', 'Regional U.S.', 'Business & Money', 'Industries', 'Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Beverages & Wine', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Cooking Education & Reference', 'Essays', 'Celebrities & TV Shows', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Anthony Bourdain'], 'title": "Kitchen Confidential Updated Edition: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (P.S.)", "isbn13": "9780060899226", "msrp": 16.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060899220", "isbn10": "0060899220"}}
