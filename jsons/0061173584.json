{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': '"Sex can be just gorgeous—and sometimes it is the most beautiful thing that can happen between a man and a woman. But don\'t you also think that it can be just practical? Like when you\'re hungry and don\'t want a three-course meal with wine, music, and ambience; you just want a sandwich. You don\'t love the sandwich. You don\'t hate the sandwich. You just want to eat the sandwich and feel satisfied."<br/>Dr. Pepper Schwartz has always encouraged women to embrace their sexual appetites. After three decades of answering people\'s questions about their emotional, sexual, and romantic lives; after writing several books on sex and relationships; after thirty-five years as a sociology professor at the University of Washington, she has formed firm opinions about sex and relationships. However, when her own situation changes, when she becomes a single woman after twenty-three years of marriage, she has to reevaluate and discover how sex and dating can work for her at this unique time in her life.<br/>Masters and Johnson, the famous sex researchers concluded that you can have sex, and want sex, way into old age, if you never stop doing it. And Pepper is very sure that she never wants to stop doing it. Now, she must make the effort to put herself in the running—getting in shape physically, emotionally, and spiritually—and figure out ways to meet worthy and available men. Ideally, she would like to have a serious relationship, but if that isn\'t in the cards, she still wants sex and companionship. And while she may feel as sexually alive as she did when she was twenty-five, the number and availability of men has changed.<br/>So, how do you look for a life partner after fifty and enjoy sexual adventures along the way?<br/>Prime is Dr. Pepper\'s response to this question. It\'s her story of exploration—sex, adventure, and romance—spread out like a road map for women of every age, because even as she is telling her own tale, she doesn\'t forget to exercise her talent for advice. Whether you\'re looking to wake up a tired sex life, start a new relationship, explore cyber-dating, indulge in a four-hand massage, flirt with gigolos on vacation, or commit to the love of your life, you can find tempting tips and genuinely helpful guidance.<br/>The prime of life has lengthened and as Dr. Pepper\'s experiences show, it would be wrong not to live every moment to the fullest. Calling for a brave and creative reevaluation of what is possible in the second half of women\'s lives, Prime invites every woman to relish her sexuality, take risks, and go after what she really wants—whether it\'s a sandwich or something substantially more satisfying. . . .', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/85/9780061173585.jpg', 'title_long': 'Prime: Adventures and Advice on Sex, Love, and the Sensual Years', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.93}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2007-06-26', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Love & Romance', 'Sex', 'Happiness', 'Self-Esteem', 'Success', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Sexuality', 'Parenting & Relationships'], 'authors': ['Pepper Schwartz'], 'title': 'Prime: Adventures and Advice on Sex, Love, and the Sensual Years', 'isbn13': '9780061173585', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061173584', 'isbn10': '0061173584'}}
