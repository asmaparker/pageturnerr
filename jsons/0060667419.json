{"book": {"publisher": "HarperSanFrancisco", "synopsis": "Unfortunately, in today"s world many people fail to experience the freedom and healing power of God"s grace. Even Christians too often experience judgement, rather than the love that is the vital essence of Christian life. A visionary guide in the spirit of Celebration of Discipline, Embracing the Love of God calls Christians back to the basics -- to understanding the promise of God"s love to transform our most important relationships and fulfill our deepest spiritual needs.Here James Bryan Smith launches readers on a revitalizing spiritual journey. He distills the basic principles of Christian love and provides a new model for relationship with God, self, and others that is based not on fear and judgement, but rather on acceptance and care. Smith's moving insights illuminate the gentle nature of God's love and teach readers how to continue on the path of love by embracing it day by day. For both new Christians and those desiring renewal, Embracing the Love of God offers hope, peace, and guidance for spiritual growth.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/74/12/9780060667412.jpg", "title_long": "Embracing the Love of God: The Path and Promise of Christian Life", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 7.375 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.61288508836 Pounds, Width: 0.783333 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.783333}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.61288508836}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.375}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "1995-06-28", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Personal Growth', 'Worship & Devotion', 'Hymns & Hymnals', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["James Bryan Smith'], 'title": "Embracing the Love of God: The Path and Promise of Christian Life", "isbn13": "9780060667412", "msrp": 17.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0060667419", "isbn10": "0060667419"}}
