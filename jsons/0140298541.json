{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "Nothing can prepare you for Anthony Loyd"s portrait of war. It is the story of the unspeakable terror and the visceral, ecstatic thrill of combat, and the lives and dreams laid to waste by the bloodiest conflict that Europe has witnessed since the Second World War.<br/>Born into a distinguished military family, Loyd was raised on the stories of his ancestors" exploits and grew up fascinated with war. Unsatisfied by a brief career in the British Army, he set out for the killing fields in Bosnia. It was there--in the midst of the roar of battle and the life-and-death struggle among the Serbs, Croatians, and Bosnian Muslims--that he would discover humanity at its worst and best. Profoundly shocking, poetic, and ultimately redemptive, this is an uncompromising look at the brutality of war and its terrifyingly seductive power.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/85/43/9780140298543.jpg", "title_long": "My War Gone By, I Miss It So", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.6}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2001-02-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'Middle East', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Journalists', 'History', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Anthony Loyd'], 'title": "My War Gone By, I Miss It So", "isbn13": "9780140298543", "msrp": 11.49, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140298541", "isbn10": "0140298541"}}
