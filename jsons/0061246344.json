{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins Publishers', 'synopsis': "Toni Rodden has escaped a life of prostitution and vows she'll never let a man control her again. After months on the wagon train, she's finally earned her place, albeit grudgingly from some, and has found a surrogate family in Fannie Caldwell and her two siblings. For the first time she can taste freedom and the possibilities of a new life. But as Fannie prepares to marry wagon master Blake Tanner, Toni realizes how alone she is and questions whether she'll ever find acceptance, or true love.<br/>Despite Toni's conviction that no man will be able to see beyond her marred past, Sam Two-Feathers, the half-Indian wagon scout and acting preacher for the train, seems to know of a love that forgives sins and values much more than outward appearances. Will Sam have the confidence to declare his love? Will Toni be able to trust in a love that can forgive even the darkest past?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/40/9780061246340.jpg', 'title_long': 'Distant Heart (Westward Hearts, Book 2)', 'edition': 'X-Library - 1st', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.46 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.61}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.46}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 262, 'date_published': '2008-01-02', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Westerns', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Tracey Bateman'], 'title': 'Distant Heart (Westward Hearts, Book 2)', 'isbn13': '9780061246340', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006174462X'}, 'isbn': '0061246344', 'isbn10': '0061246344', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061744624', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
