{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "A clear and eloquent leading translation of the Roman emperorâ€™s reflections of human life and death, timeless Stoic philosophy that inspires countless others including The Daily Stoic author Ryan Holiday to use philosophy as a tool for self-improvement and resilience to live a better life<br/><br/>Written in Greek by an intellectual Roman emperor without any intention of publication, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius offer a wide range of fascinating spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the leader struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. Spanning from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the question of virtue, human rationality, the nature of the gods and the values of leadership. But while the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation, in developing his beliefs Marcus also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a series of wise and practical aphorisms that have been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and ordinary readers for almost two thousand years.<br/><br/>To provide a full understanding of Aurelius"s seminal work, this edition includes explanatory notes, a general index, an index of quotations, an index of names, and an introduction by Diskin Clay putting the work in its biographical, historical, and literary context, a chronology of Marcus Aurelius"s life and career.<br/><br/>Penguin Classics is the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world, representing a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/93/34/9780140449334.jpg", "title_long": "Meditations (Penguin Classics)", "edition": "Anniversary", "dimensions": "Height: 7.77 Inches, Length: 5.02 Inches, Weight: 0.4960400895 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.02}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4960400895}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.77}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2006-10-31", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'History', 'Ancient Civilizations', 'Rome', 'Europe', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Ethics & Morality', 'Greek & Roman', 'Movements'], 'authors": ["Marcus Aurelius'], 'title": "Meditations (Penguin Classics)", "isbn13": "9780140449334", "msrp": 11, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140449337", "isbn10": "0140449337"}}
