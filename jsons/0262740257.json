{"book": {"publisher": "The MIT Press", "synopsis": "One of our most daring intellectuals offers a Lacanian interpretation of religion, finding that early Christianity was the first revolutionary collective.<br/>Slavoj Žižek has been called "an academic rock star" and "the wild man of theory'; his writing mixes astonishing erudition and references to pop culture in order to dissect current intellectual pieties. In The Puppet and the Dwarf he offers a close reading of today\'s religious constellation from the viewpoint of Lacanian psychoanalysis. He critically confronts both predominant versions of today\'s spirituality—New Age gnosticism and deconstructionist-Levinasian Judaism—and then tries to redeem the 'materialist' kernel of Christianity. His reading of Christianity is explicitly political, discerning in the Pauline community of believers the first version of a revolutionary collective. Since today even advocates of Enlightenment like Jurgen Habermas acknowledge that a religious vision is needed to ground our ethical and political stance in a 'postsecular' age, this book—with a stance that is clearly materialist and at the same time indebted to the core of the Christian legacy—is certain to stir controversy.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/58/9780262740258.jpg", "title_long": "The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity (Short Circuits)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.44}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.54}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.50044933474}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 196, "date_published": "2003-08-29", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Bible Study & Reference', 'Criticism & Interpretation', 'Theology', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies', 'Philosophy', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology'], 'authors": ["Slavoj Zizek'], 'title": "The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity (Short Circuits)", "isbn13": "9780262740258", "msrp": 23.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0262261308", "ePub": "0262261308"}, "isbn": "0262740257", "isbn10": "0262740257", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780262261302", "binding": "print"}]}}
