{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'An honest, intimate look at the lives of today\'s teens—told through the true experiences of friends at a New England prep school<br/>Established in 1798, Milton Academy has a proud history of achievement. It has educated artists and CEOs; it has produced a long line of distinguished scholars and dignitaries; and it has shepherded students through the world of high-pressure academics for generations. Since its founding, the public face of Milton had always been one of integrity and pride . . . until a sex scandal rocked the campus and made headlines in the spring of 2005. The offense? Teenagers doing no more than what others had done before them—except this time they got caught.<br/>Restless Virgins is the riveting real-life story of a group of seniors who were there as the "incident" (as it came to be called) unfolded: Whitney, the athletic and sensual beauty every girl wants to be; Annie, who craves acceptance but is torn between the desire for peer approval and musical success; Jillian, the smart one who is sick of high school drama and desperate to go to college; and Reed, a "hockey god" who has it all but whose charisma masks a secret insecurity.<br/>From "friends with benefits" to STDs, today\'s teens face a wider array of social and sexual opportunities—and pressures—than ever before. Through its eye-opening yet sensitive depiction of a group of normal kids with normal struggles, Restless Virgins offers an important look at contemporary adolescence no teen, parent, or educator can afford to miss. And it is written by two recent Milton graduates who know this world—and these students—like no others.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/50/9780061192050.jpg', 'title_long': 'Restless Virgins: Love, Sex, and Survival at a New England Prep School', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2007-08-28', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Adolescent Psychology', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Teenagers', 'Parenting Girls', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', "Children's Studies", 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Student Life'], 'authors': ['Abigail Jones', 'Marissa Miley'], 'title': 'Restless Virgins: Love, Sex, and Survival at a New England Prep School', 'isbn13': '9780061192050', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061192058', 'isbn10': '0061192058'}}
