{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Sarasota lawyer Lilly Cleary has had her share of odd cases. She's defended everyone from a pet psychic to an orange libeler, and she's done so with finesse. But it's another situation entirely when she finds out that her nutty mother has been accused of murder. Although she's been estranged from her family for years, Lilly drops everything to return to the little town of Bugfest, Georgia, and steps into more than she bargained for. Her mother's house is beyond a mess, and Bugfest itself is under attack by developers who want to turn it into a resort community.<br/>It's enough to keep Lilly busy, at least until someone tries to murder her dear old mom. She's ready to rescue the residents of Bugfest . . . but Lilly may not be in time to save her mother's life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/70/9780060773670.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sweetheart Deal (Lilly Cleary, 4)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.38 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.38}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Legal', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Claire Matturro'], 'title': 'Sweetheart Deal (Lilly Cleary, 4)', 'isbn13': '9780060773670', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061844225'}, 'isbn': '0060773677', 'isbn10': '0060773677', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061844225', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
