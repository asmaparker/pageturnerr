{'book': {'publisher': 'Robin Book', 'synopsis': "Building on the foundations of To Ride a Silver Broomstick and To Stir a Magick Cauldron , Silver RavenWolf's latest labor raises readers to the next plane of contemporary Wicca. Working on several levels--from novice to veteran-- To Light a Sacred Flame takes a no-nonsense look at applying the mechanics of witchcraft to achieve your personal goals in life and stoke the flames of universal harmony. RavenWolf has a gift for being at your side as you read, and her talent shines in this book. Who else would show you how to use a Slinky to encourage a meditative state? While the first two books in this series are a wonderful introduction to the realm of Wicca, To Light a Sacred Flame blazes with pure, outspoken, unabashed RavenWolf. --Brian Patterson", 'language': 'es', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/22/9788479274122.jpg', 'title_long': 'Magia Practica Para El Nuevo Milenio (Spanish Edition)', 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2000', 'subjects': ['Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Silver RavenWolf'], 'title': 'Magia Practica Para El Nuevo Milenio (Spanish Edition)', 'isbn13': '9788479274122', 'msrp': 19.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '8479274123', 'isbn10': '8479274123'}}
