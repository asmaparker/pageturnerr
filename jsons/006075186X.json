{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Battle Cry is the riveting Marine epic by the bestselling author of such classics as Trinity and Exodus.<br/>Originally published in 1953, Leon Uris's Battle Cry is the raw and exciting story of men at war from a legendary American author.<br/>This is the story of enlisted men – Marines – at the beginning of World War II. They are a rough–and–ready tangle of guys from America's cities and farms and reservations. Led by a tough veteran sergeant, these soldiers band together to emerge as part of one of the most elite fighting forces in the world. With staggering realism and detail, we follow them into intense battles – Guadalcanal and Tarawa – and through exceptional moments of camaraderie and bravery. Battle Cry does not extol the glories of war, but proves itself to be one of the greatest war stories of all time.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/69/9780060751869.jpg', 'title_long': 'Battle Cry', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.74 Pounds, Width: 1.408 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.408}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.74}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 694, 'date_published': '2005-06-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'War', 'Action & Adventure', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Leon Uris'], 'title': 'Battle Cry', 'isbn13': '9780060751869', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '006075186X', 'isbn10': '006075186X'}}
