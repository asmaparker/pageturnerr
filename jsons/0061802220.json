{'book': {'publisher': 'Balzer + Bray', 'synopsis': "From award-winning author Emily Jenkins and New York Times bestselling illustrator Harry Bliss comes the first book in a sweet, quirky chapter book series about a boy and his invisible friend, Inkling. Perfect for fans of Clementine and Ivy and Bean. This series is a great choice for emerging readers who are ready for chapter books.<br/>The thing about Hank's new friend Inkling is, he's invisible.No, not imaginary. Inkling is an invisible bandapat, a creature native to the Peruvian Woods of Mystery. (Or maybe it is the Ukrainian glaciers. Inkling hardly ever gets his stories straight.)<br/>Now Inkling has found his way into Hank's apartment on his quest for squash, a bandapat favorite. But Hank has bigger problems than helping Inkling fend off maniac doggies and searching for pumpkins: Bruno Gillicut is a lunch-stealing, dirtbug caveperson and he's got to be stopped. And who better to help stand up to a bully than an invisible friend?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/25/9780061802225.jpg', 'title_long': 'Invisible Inkling (Invisible Inkling, 1)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.26 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.26}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2012-04-24', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Chapter Books & Readers', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Where We Live', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Emily Jenkins'], 'title': 'Invisible Inkling (Invisible Inkling, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061802225', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0062084518', 'ePub': '0062084518'}, 'isbn': '0061802220', 'isbn10': '0061802220', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062084514', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
