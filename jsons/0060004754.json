{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Annie Darling's murder mystery cruise in the waters off her not-always-idyllic isle of Broward's Rock is going swimmingly -- until one of the revelers plunges overboard. And despite hubby Max's courageous rescue attempt, faux murder turns all too quickly into real-life death. As the body count rises over the next few days, the popular proprietress of the Death on Demand bookstore begins to suspect that all the victims were murdered most foully, and that they are all connected in some unknown way. But what intrepid crime solver Annie does not realize is that the killer she seeks is more ingeniously efficient than most -- and the puzzle she wishes to unravel is, in reality, a time bomb packed with an explosive mix of arson, assault, kidnapping, robbery ... and homicide, naturally.<br/>One false step and Annie, Max, and their canny cohorts will be blown off Broward's Rock for good.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/50/9780060004750.jpg', 'title_long': 'Murder Walks the Plank (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 15)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.84}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-03-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Carolyn Hart'], 'title': 'Murder Walks the Plank (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 15)', 'isbn13': '9780060004750', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061864935'}, 'isbn': '0060004754', 'isbn10': '0060004754', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061864933', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
