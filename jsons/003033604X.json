{'book': {'publisher': 'Brooks Cole', 'synopsis': "Quality writing, seamless technology integration, and a rich ancillary package are hallmarks of John C. Kotz and Paul M. Treichel, Jr.'s CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL REACTIVITY. Now thoroughly revised and enhanced, the fifth edition of this best-selling text will bring students to a new level of understanding and appreciation for chemistry's vital role in their lives. By emphasizing the close interrelationship of the macroscopic, symbolic, and particulate levels of chemistry, Kotz and Treichel provide an important organizing principle that carries throughout the book. The text's significantly revised art program reveals these three levels in engaging detail. This new art program is fully integrated with CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL REACTIVITY'S unparalleled CD-ROM, GENERAL CHEMISTRY INTERACTIVE, VERSION 3.0. With hundreds of guided simulations, animations, and video clips, as well as new Intelligent Tutors that guide students step-by-step through problems, GENERAL CHEMISTRY INTERACTIVE is the benchmark learning tool by which all others are measured-and it is included with every new copy of the text.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/41/9780030336041.jpg', 'title_long': 'CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL REACTIVITY W/CD', 'edition': '5', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 5.45 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 5.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.5}}, 'pages': 1184, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Chemistry', 'General & Reference'], 'authors': ['John C.
