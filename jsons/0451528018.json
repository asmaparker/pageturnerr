Sherlock Holmes and his faithful friend Dr. John Watson agree to investigate the truth of the matter. They will soon learn that in this case, nothing is quite as it seems....<br/><br/>The most famous of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories, The Hound of the Baskervilles is a classic of masterful detection and hair-raising suspense.<br/><br/>Includes an Afterword by Anne Perry", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/18/9780451528018.jpg", "title_long": "The Hound of the Baskervilles: 150th Anniversary Edition (Signet Classics)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.13 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.13}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.69}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2001-07-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Cozy', 'Supernatural', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Sir Arthur Conan Doyle'], 'title": "The Hound of the Baskervilles: 150th Anniversary Edition (Signet Classics)", "isbn13": "9780451528018", "msrp": 4.95, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101098392"}, "isbn": "0451528018", "isbn10": "0451528018", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101098394", "binding": "print"}]}}
