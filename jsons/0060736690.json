{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': 'A smart and scathing bestseller: former Clinton adviser and confidant Dick Morris offers a response to Hillary Clinton′s biography - to expose the history of lies and obfuscations this very controversial politician has left in her wake...<br/>In Rewriting History, Dick Morris had his biggest bestseller in years--and with its subject, Hillary Clinton, perennially in the spotlight, this smart and scathing rebuttal to Living History is sure to have a robust life in paperback as well.<br/>A long-time adviser to both Clintons, in Rewriting History Dick Morris turns his sharp-eyed gaze on Hilary, the former first lady, current New York Senator, and bestselling author. For, as he argues, no politician in America today is better aligned to become president in 2008-and none would bring more baggage to the White house-than Mrs. Clinton. Drawing on his own long working relationship with the Clintons, as well as his trademark deep research and candid, non-partisan analysis, Morris pierces Hillary′s mask to get at the truth behind the distortions and omissions of her memoir. Here we meet the real Hillary, both good and bad: the manager who makes the trains run on time, but also the paranoid who sees all those who disagree with her as personal enemies; the idealist, but also the "advice addict" easily misled by the guru of the moment. Morris describes Hillary′s sense of entitlement, and warns that it may lead deep into financial scandal. And he demonstrates how Hillary dodges criticism by pretending that every attack is directed not just at her, but at every working woman in America.<br/>Ultimately, Morris argues, Hillary Clinton faces a choice. Will she, like Bobby Kennedy, see the error of her ruthless ways, and embrace the sincere idealism she professes? Or, like Richard Nixon, will she allow the darker angels of her nature to overcome her, jeopardizing herself and the country in the process? As Rewriting History suggests, we can only hope that her past performance is no guarantee of future results.<br/>o For political buffs.<br/>o Dick Morris′s credibility as an insider-from his years of experience as an advisor to politicians of every stripe, to his own extensive interactions with the Clintons in the years leading up to and during Clinton′s presidency-makes Morris′s book the most qualified analysis of, and answer to, Senator Clinton′s bestselling memoir.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/99/9780060736699.jpg', 'title_long': 'Rewriting History', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.83 Inches, Length: 9.02 Inches, Weight: 0.97885244328 Pounds, Width: 6.42 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.02}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.42}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.725}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.83}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2005-05-03', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political', 'History', 'Americas', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'United States', 'Elections & Political Process', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Dick Morris'], 'title': 'Rewriting History', 'isbn13': '9780060736699', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0061753211', 'ePub': '0061753211'}, 'isbn': '0060736690', 'isbn10': '0060736690', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061753213', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
