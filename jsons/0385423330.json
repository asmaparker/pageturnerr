{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "First published in 1966, Naguib Mahfouz’s Adrift on the Nile is an atmospheric novel that dramatizes the rootlessness of Egypt’s cosmopolitan middle class. Anis Zani is a bored and drug-addicted civil servant who is barely holding on to his job. Every evening he hosts a gathering on a houseboat on the Nile, where he and a motley group of cynical and aimless friends share a water pipe full of kif, a mixture of tobacco and marijuana. When a young female journalist—an “alarmingly serious person”—joins them and begins secretly documenting their activities, the group’s harmony starts disintegrating, culminating in a midnight joyride that ends in tragedy.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/35/9780385423335.jpg", "title_long": "Adrift on the Nile", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.94 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.33730726086 Pounds, Width: 0.48 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.48}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.33730726086}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.94}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "1994-01-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Psychological', 'World Literature', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Naguib Mahfouz'], 'title": "Adrift on the Nile", "isbn13": "9780385423335", "msrp": 12.72, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0525431616"}, "isbn": "0385423330", "isbn10": "0385423330", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780525431619", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
