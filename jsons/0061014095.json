{"book": {"publisher": "HarperTorch", "synopsis": "Once upon a time Maggie Reid had a nice home, a rich husaband, and an adoring daughter. But that fairy-tale life hit the skids when her no-good man left her for a busty bottle blonde, and her rebellious teenage daughter went with him. Maggie"s mama didn"t raise no fool, though. Wide-awake and smelling the Starbucks, Maggie decides to follow her heart and becomes a country-western singer at the Golden Stallion Club.<br/>There, she glimpses her destiny--a lanky cowboy in steel-tipped boots and tight jeans. Though she"s determined to meet Marshall Weathers, she sure isn't desperate enough to kill her pesky ex-brother-in-law, Jimmy, to do it. As fate would have it, Weathers is the detective investigating Jimmy's murder, and Maggie is his leading suspect. Unless she wants to sing the prison blues, Maggie's got to do some fancy two-stepping to expose Jimmy's true killer--and find her true love.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/40/93/9780061014093.jpg", "title_long": "Your Cheatin" Heart: A Novel", 'edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.84}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2000-02-02", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Nancy Bartholomew'], 'title": "Your Cheatin" Heart: A Novel", 'isbn13": "9780061014093", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0061014095", "isbn10": "0061014095"}}
