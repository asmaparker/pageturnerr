{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Helene, the Countess Godwin, knows there is nothing more unbearably tedious than a virtuous woman. After all, she's been one for ten long years while her scoundrel of a husband lives with strumpets and causes scandal after scandal. So she decides it's time for a change -- she styles her hair in the newest, daring mode, puts on a shockingly transparent gown, and goes to a ball like Cinderella, hoping to find a prince charming to sweep her off her feet...and into his bed.<br/>But instead of a prince, she finds only her own volatile, infuriatingly handsome...husband, Rees, the Earl Godwin. They'd eloped to Gretna Green in a fiery passion, but passion can sometimes burn too hot to last.<br/>But now, Rees makes her a brazen offer, and Helene decides to become his wife again...but not in name only. No, this time she decides to be very, very wicked indeed.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/82/9780060560782.jpg', 'title_long': 'Your Wicked Ways (Duchess in Love, 4)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.77}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-03-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'British & Irish', 'Romance', 'Ancient World', '20th Century', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Eloisa James'], 'title': 'Your Wicked Ways (Duchess in Love, 4)', 'isbn13': '9780060560782', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '006179676X', 'ePub': '006179676X'}, 'isbn': '0060560789', 'isbn10': '0060560789', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061796760', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
