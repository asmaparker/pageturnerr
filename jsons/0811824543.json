{"book": {"publisher": "Chronicle Books", "synopsis": "The Sun has set, the campfire is lit, and dark night presses insuddenly, the wilderness seems very big and very scary. In the good old-fashioned tradition of story-telling, The Campfire Collection offers twenty-five spine-tingling tales, both true and fictional, of the human experience in the great outdoors. From beastly attacks, to brushes with death and supernatural encounters, this anthology captures the cruel, sometimes macabre, side of Mother Nature. And it isn"t pretty. Haruki Murakami describes a life destroying tsunami, and Cynthia Dusel-Bacon gives an agonizingly detailed account of being mauled by a bear. Rounded corners and durable cover make this a suitable companion for any overnight excursion, and large type means easy radin by campfire or flashlight. Whether you"re just pitching a tent in the backyard or all the way up on the top of Mount Everest, The Campfire Collection is a chilling read from writers who have lived to tell.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/45/9780811824545.jpg", "title_long": "The Campfire Collection: Spine-tingling Tales to Tell in the Dark", "edition": "2nd Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 8.1 Inches, Length: 5.7 Inches, Weight: 0.771617917 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.7}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.771617917}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.1}}, "pages": 242, "date_published": "2000-03-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Folklore & Mythology'], 'authors": [], "title": "The Campfire Collection: Spine-tingling Tales to Tell in the Dark", "isbn13": "9780811824545", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0811824543", "isbn10": "0811824543"}}
