{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "The Nuclear Age is about one man\"s slightly insane attempt to come to terms with a dilemma that confronts us allâ€”a little thing called The Bomb. The year is 1995, and William Cowling has finally found the courage to meet his fears head-on. Cowling\"s courage takes the form of a hole that he begins digging in his backyard in an effort to "bury' all thoughts of the apocalypse. Cowling\'s wife, however, is ready to leave him; his daughter has taken to calling him 'nutto'; and Cowling\'s own checkered past seems to be rising out of the crater taking shape on his lawn, besieging him with flashbacks and memories of a life that\'s had more than its share of turmoil. Brilliantly interweaving his masterful storytelling powers with dark, surreal humor and empathy for characters caught in circumstances beyond their control, Tim O\'Brien brings us his most entertaining novel to date. At once wildly comic and sneakily profound, The Nuclear Age is also utterly unforgettable.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/91/00/9780140259100.jpg", "title_long": "The Nuclear Age", "dimensions": "Height: 7.74 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.53792791928 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.77}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.53792791928}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.74}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "1996-12-01", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Tim O'Brien'], 'title": "The Nuclear Age", "isbn13": "9780140259100", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140259104", "isbn10": "0140259104"}}
