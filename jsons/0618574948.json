{"book": {"publisher": "Mariner Books", "synopsis": "The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien\"s three-volume epic, is set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth - home to many strange beings, and most notably hobbits, a peace-loving "little people," cheerful and shy. Since its original British publication in 1954-55, the saga has entranced readers of all ages. It is at once a classic myth and a modern fairy tale. Critic Michael Straight has hailed it as one of the 'very few works of genius in recent literature.' Middle-earth is a world receptive to poets, scholars, children, and all other people of good will. Donald Barr has described it as 'a scrubbed morning world, and a ringing nightmare world...especially sunlit, and shadowed by perils very fundamental, of a peculiarly uncompounded darkness.' The story of ths world is one of high and heroic adventure. Barr compared it to Beowulf, C.S. Lewis to Orlando Furioso, W.H. Auden to The Thirty-nine Steps. In fact the saga is sui generis - a triumph of imagination which springs to life within its own framework and on its own terms.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/40/9780618574940.jpg", "title_long": "The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings (1)", "edition": "28", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.35 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.35}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.05}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 544, "date_published": "2005-06-01", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["J.R.R.
