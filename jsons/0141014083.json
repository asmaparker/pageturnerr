{"book": {"publisher": "PENGUIN", "synopsis": "On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of its first publication, here is the definitive edition of the book acclaimed as “the most affecting and successful narrative ever done about the Holocaust” (Wall Street Journal) and “the first masterpiece in comic book history” (The New Yorker).<br/><br/>The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler’s Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father’s story. Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in “drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust” (The New York Times).<br/><br/>Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek’s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century’s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/40/81/9780141014081.jpg", "title_long": "The Complete Maus", "edition": "unknown", "dimensions": "Height: 0.70472440873 Inches, Length: 9.0944881797 Inches, Weight: 1.4770971554 Pounds, Width: 6.4960629855 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.0944881797}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.4960629855}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.4770971554}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.70472440873}}, "pages": 296, "date_published": "2003-10-02", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography'], 'authors": ["Spiegelman Art'], 'title": "The Complete Maus", "isbn13": "9780141014081", "msrp": 23.76, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0141014083", "isbn10": "0141014083"}}
