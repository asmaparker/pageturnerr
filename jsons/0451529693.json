{"book": {"publisher": "Signet", "synopsis": "Bazarov—a gifted, impatient, and caustic young man—has journeyed from school to the home of his friend Arkady Kirsanov. But soon Bazarov’s outspoken rejection of authority and social conventions touches off quarrels, misunderstandings, and romantic entanglements that will utterly transform the Kirsanov household and reflect the changes taking place all across nineteenth-century Russia.<br/><br/>Fathers and Sons enraged the old and the young, reactionaries, romantics, and radicals alike when it was first published. At the same time, Turgenev won the acclaim of Flaubert, Maupassant, and Henry James for his craftsmanship as a writer and his psychological insight. Fathers and Sons is now considered one of the world’s greatest novels.<br/><br/>A timeless depiction of generational conflict during social upheaval, it vividly portrays the clash between the older Russian aristocracy and the youthful radicalism that foreshadowed the revolution to come—and offers modern-day readers much to reflect upon as they look around at their own tumultuous, changing world.<br/><br/>Introduction by Jane Costlow", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/95/9780451529695.jpg", "title_long": "Fathers and Sons (Signet Classics)", "dimensions": "Height: 6.71 Inches, Length: 4.1 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.71}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2005-02-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Ivan Turgenev'], 'title": "Fathers and Sons (Signet Classics)", "isbn13": "9780451529695", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0451529693", "isbn10": "0451529693"}}
