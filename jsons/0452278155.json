An original and funny thinker, thrashing around in the playground of human sexuality, Savage advises on a wide range of titillating topics:* What is the best seduction music?* How do I come out to my fundamentalist parents?* What is so wonderful about intercourse, anyway?Forget Anka Radakovich and Isadora Altman.
