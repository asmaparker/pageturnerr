Back in the Middle Ages, he was a feared warrior, a charming womanizer, and a...well...he was strictly human. But a dark curse has made him a changed man. In fact, during moments of great passion, he becomes the feral hound his conquests oft accused him of being. And if that isn't bad enough, another brush with the black arts has thrust him into a time frame other than his own. Thus it is that he finds himself in the Prince Regent's elegant London.<br/>Brave, adaptable and utterly charming, O'Banyon is determined to enjoy life wherever it leads. In fact, he realizes he can live quite happily amid the posh ton if he avoids highly passionate encounters, keeps his secrets to himself, and limits his saturated fats. And so he does, until he meets the one woman he cannot resist, and learns she possesses the singular quality he fears more than death itself.
