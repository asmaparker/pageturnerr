She is single in New York City, stuck in a job she doesn’t want and a life that seems to have, somehow, just happened. She inherited a flair for Italian cooking from her grandmother, but she never seems to have the time for it—these days, her oven holds only sweaters. Tacked to her office bulletin board is a photo from a magazine of a tidy cottage on the coast of Maine—a charming reminder of a life that could be hers, if she could only muster the courage to go after it.<br/>On a hope and a chance, Angela decides to pack it all up and move to Maine, finding the nudge she needs in the dating profile of a handsome sailor who loves dogs and Italian food. But her new home isn’t quite matching up with the fantasy. Far from everything familiar, Angela begins to rebuild her life from the ground up. Working at a local coffeehouse, she begins to discover the pleasures and secrets of her new small-town community and, in the process, realizes there’s really no such thing as the way life should be.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/18/9780060798918.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Way Life Should Be', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2007-07-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', "Women's Fiction", 'Single Women', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Christina Baker Kline'], 'title': 'The Way Life Should Be', 'isbn13': '9780060798918', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060798912', 'isbn10': '0060798912'}}
