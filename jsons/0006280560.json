{'book': {'publisher': 'Harpercollins Pub Ltd', 'synopsis': 'A stunning new edition of this timeless allegory of heaven and hell, repackaged and rebranded as part of the C.S. Lewis Signature Classics range. C.S. Lewis\'s dazzling allegory about heaven and hell and the chasm fixed between them, is one of his most brilliantly imaginative tales which will appeal to readers of all ages. Lewis communicates deep spiritual truths through the sheer power of the fantastic. In The Great Divorce the writer in a dream boards a bus on a drizzly afternoon and embarks on an incredible voyage through Heaven and Hell. He meets a host of supernatural beings far removed from his expectations and comes to significant realisations about the ultimate consequences of everyday behaviour. This is the starting point for a profound meditation upon good and evil. "If we insist on keeping Hell (or even Earth) we shall not see Heaven: if we accept Heaven we shall not be able to retain even the smallest and most intimate souvenirs of Hell."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/69/9780006280569.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Great Divorce', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.25132697868 Pounds, Width: 0.35433 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.35433}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.25132697868}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['History'], 'authors': ['C.S.
