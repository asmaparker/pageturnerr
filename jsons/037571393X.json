{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "John James Audubon came to America as a dapper eighteen-year-old eager to make his fortune. He had a talent for drawing and an interest in birds, and he would spend the next thirty-five years traveling to the remotest regions of his new country–often alone and on foot–to render his avian subjects on paper. The works of art he created gave the world its idea of America. They gave America its idea of itself.<br/><br/>Here Richard Rhodes vividly depicts Audubon’s life and career: his epic wanderings; his quest to portray birds in a lifelike way; his long, anguished separations from his adored wife; his ambivalent witness to the vanishing of the wilderness. John James Audubon: The Making of an American is a magnificent achievement.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/34/9780375713934.jpg", "title_long": "John James Audubon: The Making of an American", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 1.01192178258 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.01192178258}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.95}}, "pages": 544, "date_published": "2006-04-11", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Individual Artists', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Artists, Architects & Photographers', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Science & Math', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Birdwatching', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Richard Rhodes'], 'title": "John James Audubon: The Making of an American", "isbn13": "9780375713934", "msrp": 18.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "037571393X", "isbn10": "037571393X"}}
