{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "A fresh talent weaves an engaging tale of love, life, and second chances in this stirring first novel set in a small Southern town<br/>For fans of Billie Letts, Adriana Trigiani, and Lorna Landvik comes this uniquely heartfelt and spirited story from a sparkling new voice. Farm wife Lucy Hatch never dreamed her husband would walk out into the field one morning and never come back, leaving her a widow at thirty-three. And when she returns to her tiny Texas hometown, contemplating a life of quiet solitude, the last thing she expects to find is Ash Farrell -- a dashing man who has everything to teach Lucy about working through heartache and reaching to claim new love.<br/>But their budding romance is far from typical: Lucy and Ash must endure not just an irate ex-girlfriend, a false arrest, and a twenty-year flood, but every watchful eye and wagging tongue in town. Filled with richness, humor, and a vivid medley of characters, The Second Coming of Lucy Hatch transports readers on Lucy's journey as she learns to resolve her doubts and embrace a renewed sense of herself as a woman.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/52/9780060081652.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Second Coming of Lucy Hatch: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2002-08-06', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Marsha Moyer'], 'title': 'The Second Coming of Lucy Hatch: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060081652', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060081651', 'isbn10': '0060081651'}}
