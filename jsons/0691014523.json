In this monumental work, Frank blends biography, intellectual history, and literary criticism to illuminate Dostoevsky’s works and set them in their personal, historical, and ideological context. More than a biography in the usual sense, this is a cultural history of nineteenth-century Russia, providing both a rich picture of the world in which Dostoevsky lived and a major reinterpretation of his life and work.<br/><br/>This volume begins with the writer’s return to Saint Petersburg after a ten-year Siberian exile and traces how his engagement in the cultural and social ferment of Russia in the early 1860s led to his discovery of the themes that would underlie his mature masterpieces.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/24/9780691014524.jpg", "title_long": "Dostoevsky: The Stir of Liberation, 1860-1865", "edition": "New Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.1 Inches, Weight: 1.29 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.04}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.29}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "1988-11-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Journalists', 'Law Enforcement', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ["Joseph Frank'], 'title": "Dostoevsky: The Stir of Liberation, 1860-1865", "isbn13": "9780691014524", "msrp": 37.5, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "1400844231", "ePub": "1400844231"}, "isbn": "0691014523", "isbn10": "0691014523", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781400844234", "binding": "saleableprint"}]}}
