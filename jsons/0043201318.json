{'book': {'publisher': 'Unwin Hyman', 'synopsis': "From earliest times Locke's writings have been the subject of controversy. An intellectual caught up in the politics of late seventeenth century England, his writings on politics reveal a man attempting to combine an analysis of the underlying principles of society with a deep commitment to a specific political stance and party. This study explains why Locke's vision of political life has continued to fascinate political thinkers of many different persuasions. Available on its own, or as part of the 9-volume reissue of the classic Political Thinkers series.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/12/9780043201312.jpg', 'title_long': 'John Locke', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.5291094288 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5291094288}}, 'pages': 184, 'date_published': '1978', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'History & Surveys', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science'], 'authors': ['Geraint Parry'], 'title': 'John Locke', 'isbn13': '9780043201312', 'msrp': 11.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0043201318', 'isbn10': '0043201318', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781136526886', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
