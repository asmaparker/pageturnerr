Drawing together what we know about the terrorist as an individual and his or her context, this book offers a distinctive approach to understanding the terrorist and terrorism. A key quality of the work is that it draws on contemporary thinking from a range of allied disciplines, including criminology and, in particular, situational approaches to crime control. The book is structured in five broad sections, with chapters in each section delivering more detailed analysis. Key features of the book Written by a leading scholar, this book will be of great interest to students of terrorism studies, political violence, criminology, behavioural psychology and security studies/IR in general.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/39/9780080336039.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Terrorist', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.93475999088 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.93475999088}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 220, 'date_published': '1988', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors': ['Maxwell Taylor'], 'title': 'The Terrorist', 'isbn13': '9780080336039', 'msrp': 45, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0080336035', 'isbn10': '0080336035'}}
