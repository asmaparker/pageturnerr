{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Sixteen years ago, world-famous artist Harriet P. Smith was the nerdiest girl at Doolittle High School, and Jake Porter was the new boy in town. Charismatic, handsome, and instantly popular, Jake was way out of her league. Harriet was shocked when he asked her to the graduation dance . . . and devastated when he left town for good the next morning.<br/>Only his father's remarriage could bring Jake, now a hot shot L.A. music exec, back to small-town Arkansas. His only consolation is the stunning woman with the mysterious green eyes he meets at a local bar. He's got no idea he was a part of one of the best nights of her lifeâ€”or that he's about to fall for her as hard as she once did for him. Jake's never been the marrying kind, but another night with Harriet might make him change his mind.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/70/9780060582470.jpg', 'title_long': 'Not The Marrying Kind', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 3.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2007-10-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'Victorian', 'Regency', 'New Adult & College', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Hailey North'], 'title': 'Not The Marrying Kind', 'isbn13': '9780060582470', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061807621'}, 'isbn': '0060582472', 'isbn10': '0060582472', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061807626', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
