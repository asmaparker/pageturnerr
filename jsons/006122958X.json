{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': 'In this follow-up to Do the Math: Secrets, Lies, and Algebra, Tess learns that life, like algebra, sometimes has no solutions. Sometimes you just have to take a risk and figure out your own answers.<br/>The spring semester of eighth grade, like algebra, has become even more complicated for math-lover Tess. There’s the new girl at school, whom Tess is not quite sure is a friend. There’s bully Richard, who keeps playing mean pranks on her—but if she tells on him, he can finally call her a snitch, so she’s not sure she should.<br/>There’s mysterious graffiti on the wall that seems to be a math code. Is it meant for Tess to understand? Could it have anything to do with the fire set in evil Mr. Z’s classroom?<br/>Finally, Damien seems to be hanging around more than ever, but she’s not sure why— is it because he likes her, or is it just a “coincidental system” like the one she learned about in algebra class?<br/>In the end, Tess figures out that sometimes life doesn’t offer formulas to figuring out the answers. Sometimes you have to take a risk and create your own formulas and discover your own solutions, even if you make a few mistakes along the way.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/89/9780061229589.jpg', 'title_long': 'Do the Math #2: The Writing on the Wall', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.71 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.81}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.71}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2008-06-24', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Mysteries & Thrillers', 'Mystery & Detective', 'Social Issues'], 'authors': ['Wendy Lichtman'], 'title': 'Do the Math #2: The Writing on the Wall', 'isbn13': '9780061229589', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061877875'}, 'isbn': '006122958X', 'isbn10': '006122958X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061877872', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
