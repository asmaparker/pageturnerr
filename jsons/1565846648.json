{"book": {"publisher": "The New Press", "synopsis": "In addition to being short-listed for the Guardian First Book Award upon publication in 2000, Frances Stonor Saunders\"s The Cultural Cold War was met with the kind of attention reserved for books that directly hit a cultural nerve. Impassioned reviews and features in major publications such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have consistently praised Saunders\"s detailed knowledge of the CIA\"s covert operations. The Cultural Cold War presents for the first time shocking evidence of cultural manipulation during the Cold War. This 'impressively detailed' (Kirkus Reviews) book draws together newly declassified documents and exclusive interviews to expose the CIA\'s astonishing campaign wherein some of the most vocal exponents of intellectual freedom became instruments of the American government. Those involved included George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Gloria Steinem. The result is 'a tale of intrigue and betrayal, with scene after scene as thrilling as any in a John Le Carre novel' (The Chronicle of Higher Education).8 pages of black-and-white photographs.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/47/9781565846647.jpg", "title_long": "The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters", "dimensions": "Height: 9.01573 Inches, Length: 5.98424 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 1.0633837 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.98424}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.0633837}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.6}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.01573}}, "pages": 528, "date_published": "2001-04-01", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'History & Criticism', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Military', 'Intelligence & Espionage', 'World'], 'authors": ["Frances Stonor Saunders'], 'title": "The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters", "isbn13": "9781565846647", "msrp": 26.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1565846648", "isbn10": "1565846648"}}
