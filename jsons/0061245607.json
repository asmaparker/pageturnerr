{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "The Duchess of Cosway yearns for a man she has never met . . . her husband.<br/>Married by proxy as a child, Lady Isidore has spent years fending off lecherous men in every European court while waiting to meet her husband. She's determined to accept him, no matter how unattractive the duke turns out to be. When she finally lures Simeon Jermyn back to London, his dark handsomeness puts Isidore's worst fears to rest—until disaster strikes.<br/>The duke demands an annulment.<br/>Forsaking his adventuresome past, Simeon has returned to London ready to embrace the life of a proper duke, only to find that his supposed wife is too ravishing, too headstrong, and too sensual to be the docile duchess he has in mind. But Isidore will not give up her claim to the title—or him—without a fight.<br/>She will do whatever it takes to capture Simeon's heart, even if it means sacrificing her virtue. After all, a consummated marriage cannot be annulled.<br/>Yet in forcing Simeon into a delicious surrender, will Isidore risk not only her dignity—but her heart?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/02/9780061245602.jpg', 'title_long': 'When the Duke Returns (Desperate Duchesses, 4)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-11-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Holidays', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', '20th Century', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Eloisa James'], 'title': 'When the Duke Returns (Desperate Duchesses, 4)', 'isbn13': '9780061245602', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061980153'}, 'isbn': '0061245607', 'isbn10': '0061245607', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061980152', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
