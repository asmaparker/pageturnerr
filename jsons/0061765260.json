{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon A', 'synopsis': "In this amazingly timely story about what the wealthy do when Wall Street lays an egg, the author of Gilding Lily once again delivers a witty and insightful treatment of today's woman, as she explores the sacrifices they make, the bargains they strike, the rules they follow, and what happens when it all starts to fall apart.<br/>Who could have guessed that Wall Street would go south just as Marcy Emerson and her husband moved east? Down to earth Marcy relocated from Chicago to New York when her husband was offered a big time job as a hedge fund manager.<br/>She gives up her own job—after all, hedge fund wives don't work! And while at first it's fun to shop all day and party all night, Marcy quickly learns that life among the rich can be anything but easy and that behind every smile can be a stab in the back.<br/>Still, it's not until her husband leaves her for his thinner, blonder mistress—a woman who is higher up the social ladder than the original Mrs. Emerson will ever be—that Marcy decides to stand on her own two feet once again, and fight for the things that are far more important than money.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/61/9780061765261.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hedge Fund Wives', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 284, 'date_published': '2009-05-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'City Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance', 'New Adult & College', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Tatiana Boncompagni'], 'title': 'Hedge Fund Wives', 'isbn13': '9780061765261', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061874094'}, 'isbn': '0061765260', 'isbn10': '0061765260', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061874093', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
