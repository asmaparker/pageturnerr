{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': '“Steven Tyler is one of the giants of American music, who’s been influential for a whole generation of Rock ’n’ Roll fans around the world. Long May He Rock!”<br/>—Sir Paul McCartney<br/>Does the Noise in My Head Bother You? is the rock memoir to end all rock memoirs — the straight-up, no-holds-barred story of Grammy Award-winning, Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and all around superstar legend Steven Tyler, lead singer of Aerosmith (and celebrity judge on American Idol).<br/>The rock and roll epic that is Tyler’s life begins with Tyler’s youth in the Bronx, tracing his early music career and influences, his legendary partnership with Joe Perry, the meteoric rise, fall, and rise of Aerosmith over the last three decades, their music, Tyler’s battles with substance abuse, his epic romantic life, his relationship with his four children (including actress Liv Tyler), life on the road and in the spotlight, the economics of the rock star business --and all the sex, drugs, and rock and roll that anyone could ask for.<br/>In Tyler’s own words: “I’ve been mythicized, Mick-icized, eulogized and fooligized, I’ve been Cole-Portered and farmer’s-daughtered, I’ve been Led Zepped and 12-stepped. I’m a rhyming fool and so cool that me, Fritz the Cat, and Mohair Sam are the baddest cats that am. I have so many outrageous stories, too many, and I’m gonna tell ’em all. All the unexpurgated, brain-jangling tales of debauchery, sex & drugs, transcendence & chemical dependence you will ever want to hear. And this is not just my take, this is the unbridled truth, the in-your-face, up-close and prodigious tale of Steven Tyler straight from the horse’s lips.”', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/90/9780061767890.jpg', 'title_long': "Does the Noise in My Head Bother You?: A Rock 'n' Roll Memoir", 'edition': 'First Edition, First Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 1.31 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2011-05-03', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Musical Genres', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Composers & Musicians', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Rich & Famous', 'Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Steven Tyler'], 'title': "Does the Noise in My Head Bother You?: A Rock 'n' Roll Memoir", 'isbn13': '9780061767890', 'msrp': 27.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061767891', 'isbn10': '0061767891'}}
