{"book": {"publisher": "HarperTorch", "synopsis": "Bookseller Bernie Rhodenbarr\"s in love—with an exotic Eastern European beauty who shares his obsession with Humphrey Bogart movies. He\"s in heaven, munching popcorn with his new amour every night at a Bogart Film Festival—until their Casablanca-esque idyll is cut short by his other secret passion: burglary.<br/>When he\"s hired to pilfer a portfolio of valuable documents from a Park Avenue apartment, Bernie can hardly refuse. But the occupant\'s early return forces Bernie to flee empty-handed—and he soon finds himself implicated in a murder. Before you can say 'who stole the strawberries?' he\'s hunting for a killer, up to his neck in the outrageous intrigues of a tiny Balkan nation . . . and menaced by more sinister fat men and unsavory toadies than the great Bogie himself butted heads with in pursuit of that darn bird!', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/27/93/9780060872793.jpg", "title_long": "The Burglar Who Thought He Was Bogart (Bernie Rhodenbarr)", "edition": "Reprinted Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.41}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "2006-10-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'International Mystery & Crime', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Lawrence Block'], 'title": "The Burglar Who Thought He Was Bogart (Bernie Rhodenbarr)", "isbn13": "9780060872793", "msrp": 7.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "006183999X", "ePub": "006183999X"}, "isbn": "0060872799", "isbn10": "0060872799", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061839993", "binding": "print"}]}}
