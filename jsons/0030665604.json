{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt, Rinehart and Winston', 'synopsis': 'The House of the Deer, an exciting and suspenseful novel laid in the enchanting background of a deer-forest in the Highlands of Scotland, was written by D.E. Stevenson to oblige her many fans who read Gerald and Elizabeth and asked for “more about Gerald.”<br/><br/>Gerald Burleigh-Brown spends a vacation in a primitive old house miles from the nearest village, but it isn’t long before he makes friends with the local inhabitants: the young MacAslans, Gerald’s host and hostess; the innkeeper who knows all that goes on in the district; Malcolm MacGregor, the stalker, who has lived in the area all his life; and his old mother who dreams of a black horse and is thereby convinced that a dreadful accident is going to happen. Gerald joins in hunting in the deer-forest and becomes involved in some hair-raising adventures.<br/><br/>D.E. Stevenson’s men readers will enjoy all the excitement of hunting and stalking the deer, and as always her women readers will delight to read of Gerald’s realization that he is more than casually interested in one of his new friends.<br/><br/>As always, D.E. Stevenson has drawn her characters so skillfully that they become real people to her readers. And those readers of Katherine Wentworth and The Marriage of Katherine will happily recognize the high mountains of the Highlands and the thousands of acres of hills and glens where the red deer abound.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/08/9780030665608.jpg', 'title_long': 'The House of the Deer', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.9 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '1971', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['D.
