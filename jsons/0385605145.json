{"book": {"publisher": "Doubleday", "synopsis": "Bill Bryson goes to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world.<br/><br/>Kenya, generally regarded as the cradle of mankind, is a land of contrasts, with famous game reserves, stunning landscapes, and a vibrant cultural tradition. It also provides plenty to worry a traveller like Bill Bryson, fixated as he is on the dangers posed by snakes, insects and large predators. But on a more sober note, it is a country that shares many serious human and environmental problems with the rest of Africa: refugees, AIDS, drought and grinding poverty.<br/><br/>Travelling around the country, Bryson casts his inimitable eye on a continent new to him, and the resultant diary, though short in length, contains the trademark Bryson stamp of wry observation and curious insight.<br/><br/>All the author"s royalties from Bill Bryson"s African Diary, as well as all profits, will go to CARE International.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/44/9780385605144.jpg", "title_long": "Bill Bryson African Diary", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.24408 Inches, Length: 5.27558 Inches, Weight: 0.36155768 Pounds, Width: 0.43307 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.27558}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.43307}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.36155768}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.24408}}, "pages": 69, "date_published": "2002", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'Africa', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'History', 'Kenya', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors": ['Bill Bryson'], 'title": "Bill Bryson African Diary", "isbn13": "9780385605144", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0385605145", "isbn10": "0385605145"}}
