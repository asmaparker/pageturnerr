These never-before published translations unite Garcia Lorca’s masterpieces with two of America’s most gifted poets, Langston Hughes and W.S. Merwin.<br/><br/>The epigrammatic style and unsentimental lyricism of W.S. Merwin heighten the urgency and fervor of Yerma, the story of a woman whose thwarted yearning for a child makes her murder her indifferent husband.
