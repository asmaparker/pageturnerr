{"book": {"publisher": "NAL", "synopsis": "A remarkable series of lectures on the art of creating effective nonfiction by one of the 20th century"s most profound writers and thinkers--now available for the first time in print.<br/>Culled from sixteen informal lectures Ayn Rand delivered to a select audience in the late 1960s, this remarkable work offers indispensable guidance to the aspiring writer of nonfiction while providing readers with a fascinating discourse on art and creation. Based on the concept that the ability to create quality nonfiction is a skill that can be learned like any other, The Art of Nonfiction takes readers through the writing process, step-by-step, providing insightful observations and invaluable techniques along the way.<br/>In these edited transcripts, Rand discusses the psychological aspects of writing, and the different roles played by the conscious and unconscious minds. From choosing a subject to polishing a draft to mastering an individual writing style--for authors of theoretical works or those leaning toward journalistic reporting--this crucial resource introduces the words and ideas of one of our most enduring authors to a new generation.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/15/9780452282315.jpg", "title_long": "The Art of Nonfiction: A Guide for Writers and Readers", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.38801358112 Pounds, Width: 0.47 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.23}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.47}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.38801358112}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.9}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2001-02-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing'], 'authors": ["Ayn Rand'], 'title": "The Art of Nonfiction: A Guide for Writers and Readers", "isbn13": "9780452282315", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101137290", "ePub": "1101137290"}, "isbn": "0452282314", "isbn10": "0452282314", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101137291", "binding": "print"}]}}
