It is designed to assist general and special educators, administrators, and other support personnel in providing appropriate services for students with disabilities and students at risk for failure in general education settings. Early chapters cover the legal foundation for inclusion, the roles of the multidisciplinary team, culturally diverse and bilingual students, and characteristics of students at risk. Later chapters detail the process of inclusion, looking at adaptation of the physical, behavioral, and socioemotional environments, lessons plans, and teaching techniques.
