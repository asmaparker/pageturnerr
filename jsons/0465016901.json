{"book": {"publisher": "Basic Books", "synopsis": "This “rare and compelling” (New York Magazine) bestseller examines childhood trauma and the enduring effects it has on an individual\"s management of repressed anger and pain.<br/><br/>Why are many of the most successful people plagued by feelings of emptiness and alienation? This wise and profound book has provided millions of readers with an answer—and has helped them to apply it to their own lives.<br/><br/>Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings, needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parents\" expectations and win their "love.' Alice Miller writes, 'When I used the word \'gifted\' in the title, I had in mind neither children who receive high grades in school nor children talented in a special way. I simply meant all of us who have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to unspeakable cruelty by becoming numb.... Without this \'gift\' offered us by nature, we would not have survived.' But merely surviving is not enough. The Drama of the Gifted Child helps us to reclaim our life by discovering our own crucial needs and our own truth.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/07/9780465016907.jpg", "title_long": "The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self, Revised Edition", "edition": "3", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.24691773344 Pounds, Width: 0.36 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.3125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.36}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.24691773344}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 136, "date_published": "1997", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Abuse', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Personality Disorders', 'Post-traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Child Psychology', 'Pathologies', 'Personality', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Teenagers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Alice Miller'], 'title": "The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self, Revised Edition", "isbn13": "9780465016907", "msrp": 15.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0465016901", "isbn10": "0465016901"}}
