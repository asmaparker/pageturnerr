{"book": {"publisher": "Univ Of Minnesota Press", "synopsis": "This book is not only a major twentieth-century contribution to Dostoevsky’s studies, but also one of the most important theories of the novel produced in our century. As a modern reinterpretation of poetics, it bears comparison with Aristotle.“Bakhtin’s statement on the dialogical nature of artistic creation, and his differentiation of this from a history of monological commentary, is profoundly original and illuminating. This is a classic work on Dostoevsky and a statement of importance to critical theory.” Edward Wasiolek“Concentrating on the particular features of ‘Dostoevskian discourse,’ how Dostoevsky structures a hero and a plot, and what it means to write dialogically, Bakhtin concludes with a major theoretical statement on dialogue as a category of language. One of the most important theories of the novel in this century.” The Bloomsbury Review", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/84/9780816612284.jpg", "title_long": "Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics (Volume 8) (Theory and History of Literature)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.17 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.17}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "1984-06-21", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy'], 'authors": ["Mikhail Bakhtin'], 'title": "Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics (Volume 8) (Theory and History of Literature)", "isbn13": "9780816612284", "msrp": 20, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0816612285", "isbn10": "0816612285"}}
