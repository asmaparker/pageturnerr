{"book": {"publisher": "Routledge", "synopsis": "The Road to Serfdom remains one of the all-time classics of twentieth-century intellectual thought. For over half a century, it has inspired politicians and thinkers around the world, and has had a crucial impact on our political and cultural history. With trademark brilliance, Hayek argues convincingly that, while socialist ideals may be tempting, they cannot be accomplished except by means that few would approve of. Addressing economics, fascism, history, socialism and the Holocaust, Hayek unwraps the trappings of socialist ideology. He reveals to the world that little can result from such ideas except oppression and tyranny. Today, more than fifty years on, Hayek"s warnings are just as valid as when The Road to Serfdom was first published.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/95/9780415253895.jpg", "title_long": "The Road to Serfdom", "edition": "2", "dimensions": "Height: 7.81 Inches, Length: 5.06 Inches, Weight: 0.661386786 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.06}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.58}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.661386786}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.81}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2001-05-17", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic History', 'Theory'], 'authors": ["F.A.
