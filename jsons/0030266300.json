{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt & Co', 'synopsis': 'A updated edition of the book detailing the "Bates method", a technique for correcting poor eyesight through exercise. The rationale behind the Bates method is that if you wear glasses or contact lenses, the chances are that you don\'t really need to. Prescription lenses act as a prop for the eye muscles so over time the eyes actually get weaker. In the long term, glasses will only ever weaken the eyes. The Bates method restores sight firstly with a series of exercises that relax and soothe the eye muscles - the equivalent of massaging away tension build up - and secondly retrains the relaxed eyes to focus effectively. The exercises are straightforward and easy to incorporate into daily life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/00/9780030266300.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.91 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91}}, 'pages': 200, 'date_published': '1981', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diseases & Physical Ailments', 'Eye Problems'], 'authors': ['William Horatio Bates'], 'title': 'The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses', 'isbn13': '9780030266300', 'msrp': 81.12, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0030266300', 'isbn10': '0030266300'}}
