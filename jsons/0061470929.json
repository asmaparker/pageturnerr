{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Large Print', 'synopsis': 'Murder reaches deep into the halls of the U.S. Supreme Court in this latest thriller featuring defense attorney Paul Madriani, now published by William Morrow<br/><br/>Controversial law professor Terry Scarborough rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. With the publication of his new book―which claimed that the U.S. Constitution and some lost writings of Thomas Jefferson supported racial discrimination―he only added fuel to the fire. When he’s found beaten to death in a San Diego hotel room and a young man with connections to neo-Nazis is charged with first-degree murder, defense attorney Paul Madriani eagerly signs on to the case.<br/>The passionate and wily litigator believes it isn’t just about power and race. He’s betting there’s a deeper mystery to this defendant―and that he may be just as much a victim as the deceased. Amid the glare of cameras and the jeers of protesters, Madriani buckles down, digging deep to find the evidence he needs to unlock the truth. And no one will stand in his way―not an officer of the U.S. government or a sitting Supreme Court justice.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/29/9780061470929.jpg', 'title_long': 'Shadow of Power: A Paul Madriani Novel (Paul Madriani Novels, 9)', 'edition': 'LRG', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.74 Pounds, Width: 1.34 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.34}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.74}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 672, 'date_published': '2008-06-10', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Legal', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Steve Martini'], 'title': 'Shadow of Power: A Paul Madriani Novel (Paul Madriani Novels, 9)', 'isbn13': '9780061470929', 'msrp': 27.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0061470929', 'isbn10': '0061470929'}}
