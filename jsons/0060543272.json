And Lord Zachary Griffin is just the man to help them.<br/>After all, what could be more tantalizing than teaching the beautiful Witfeld sisters all the special ways of driving a man into submission—and marriage? And leading exquisite Caroline Witfeld, the most spirited and least frivolous sister, to temptation would be wildly delicious.<br/>Zachary doesn't realize that Caroline's longing gazes have less to do with attraction and more to do with admission—to a prestigious arts conservatory. If only she could set those high cheekbones, that aristocratic brow, and those powerful shoulders to canvas, her dreams would all come true. But Caroline is soon having dreams of a very different sort—ones that involve the charming rogue and some improper behavior hardly befitting a lady dedicated to her art . . .unless she becomes dedicated to the art of love.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/73/9780060543273.jpg', 'title_long': 'An Invitation to Sin (The Griffin Family, Book 2)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-11-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Victorian', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Suzanne Enoch'], 'title': 'An Invitation to Sin (The Griffin Family, Book 2)', 'isbn13': '9780060543273', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006174526X'}, 'isbn': '0060543272', 'isbn10': '0060543272', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061745263', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
