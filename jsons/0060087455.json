{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Each autumn, one of nature's most magnificent dramas plays out when striped bass undertake a journey from the northeastern United States to the Outer Banks of North Carolina in search of food and warmer seas. As the first schools move south from Maine, their numbers increase until there are 25 million stripers coursing down the coast. This roiling seaside show also attracts bigger predators, swooping seabirds, and a fanatical brotherhood of fishermen.<br/>Writer and angler David DiBenedetto followed the fall run, as this great migration is called, for three months in the autumn of 2001. To do so, he lived according to the rhythm of the tides and the stripers' night-owl tendencies. As the fish swam south, the author found himself pursuing them by every means that humans have conceived, from extreme surf casting to free diving.<br/>On the Run is much more than the story of the ultimate fishing road trip. It offers vivid portrayals of the zany and obsessive characters DiBenedetto met on his travels -- including the country's most daring fisherman; an underwater videographer who chucked his corporate job in favor of filming striped bass; and the reclusive angler who claims that catching the world-record striper in 1982 sent his life into a tailspin. Along his route, the author also delves into the natural history and biology of this great game fish, and depicts the colorful cultures of the seaside communities where the striped bass reigns supreme.<br/>The power and savagery of nature is never more evident than during the stripers' fall run, and DiBenedetto captures it all in this engaging work. Whether you are an outdoor enthusiast, an adventure lover, or simply a fan of fine writing, On the Run will have you hooked from the start.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/56/9780060087456.jpg', 'title_long': "On the Run: An Angler's Journey Down the Striper Coast", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2003-09-16', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors'], 'authors': ['David DiBenedetto'], 'title': "On the Run: An Angler's Journey Down the Striper Coast", 'isbn13': '9780060087456', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060087455', 'isbn10': '0060087455'}}
