But trouble isn't ready to let him go; it's back in Poke's life with a vengeance, in the guise of his long-estranged father, Frank, the last person he ever wanted to see again. And Frank hasn't come empty-handed, arriving with a box of rubies, a wad of fraudulent identity papers, and one of the most dangerous gangsters in China in hot pursuit. With a rogue American Secret Service agent targeting Rose for her unwitting part in a North Korean counterfeiting operation, Poke can see trouble descending from everywhere to attack those he loves—and it will take every skill he possesses to keep them, and himself, alive.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/61/9780061257261.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Fourth Watcher: A Bangkok Thriller', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2009-06-23', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', "Women's Adventure", 'United States', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Timothy Hallinan'], 'title': 'The Fourth Watcher: A Bangkok Thriller', 'isbn13': '9780061257261', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061983314'}, 'isbn': '0061257265', 'isbn10': '0061257265', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061983313', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
