{'book': {'publisher': 'Amistad', 'synopsis': "Femi is in trouble.<br/>He's gotten involved with a gang of older boys and is telling so many lies to his family, he can hardly keep his head straight. His sister, Sade, knows something is going on, but she doesn't want to worry their father while he's waiting to hear if the family will be granted asylum in Britain. But with Femi growing more and more involved with the criminal gang, how long will any of them be safe?<br/>In this sequel to Carnegie Medal winner The Other Side of Truth, acclaimed author Beverley Naidoo once again tells the story of Nigerian refugees Femi and Sade. With unflinching realism, she presents the dangers the siblings face -- not in Africa this time, but in a school very much like one of our own.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/55/9780060760755.jpg', 'title_long': 'Web of Lies', 'edition': 'First Thus', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.89}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2006-04-25', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors': ['Beverley Naidoo'], 'title': 'Web of Lies', 'isbn13': '9780060760755', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060760753', 'isbn10': '0060760753'}}
