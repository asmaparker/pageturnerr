{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "It's no secret that our population is aging. In fact, it won't be long before one in four drivers will be over the age of 65. Research suggests we'll outlive our ability to drive by almost ten yearsâ€”but knowing when to stop or limit driving isn't always clear.<br/>The Driving Dilemma is a comprehensive resource for older drivers and their families facing questions about driving safety. Dr. Dugan provides clear, useful information about the effects of age, medical conditions, and medications on driving. She offers practical advice on how to discuss this issue with loved ones. Such talks can be difficult, and the book provides not only the facts, but also a research-based approach to communication, with useful sample dialogue scripts that will help you discuss driving with your loved ones. Also included are state-by-state listings of available resources, making this book a total information source for families.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/85/9780061142185.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Driving Dilemma: The Complete Resource Guide for Older Drivers and Their Families', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006-10-31', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Aging', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Aging Parents', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Automotive', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Gerontology', 'Sociology'], 'authors': ['Elizabeth Dugan PhD'], 'title': 'The Driving Dilemma: The Complete Resource Guide for Older Drivers and Their Families', 'isbn13': '9780061142185', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061873756'}, 'isbn': '0061142182', 'isbn10': '0061142182', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061873751', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
