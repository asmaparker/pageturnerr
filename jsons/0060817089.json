{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "The heartwarming and unforgettable story of a family and the wondrously neurotic dog who taught them what really matters in life. Now with photos and new material.<br/>Is it possible for humans to discover the key to happiness through a bigger-than-life, bad-boy dog? Just ask the Grogans.<br/>John and Jenny were just beginning their life together. They were young and in love, with not a care in the world. Then they brought home Marley, a wiggly yellow furball of a puppy. Life would never be the same.<br/>Marley grew into a barreling, ninety-seven-pound streamroller of a Labrador retriever. He crashed through screen doors, gouged through drywall, and stole women's undergarments. Obedience school did no good -- Marley was expelled.<br/>But just as Marley joyfully refused any limits on his behavior, his love and loyalty were boundless, too. Marley remained a model of devotion, even when his family was at its wit's end. Unconditional love, they would learn, comes in many forms.<br/>Marley & Me is John Grogan's funny, unforgettable tribute to this wonderful, wildly neurotic Lab and the meaning he brought to their lives.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/84/9780060817084.jpg', 'title_long': "Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.97 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.97}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 291, 'date_published': '2005-12-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Dogs', 'Essays', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['John Grogan'], 'title': "Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog", 'isbn13': '9780060817084', 'msrp': 21.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060817089', 'isbn10': '0060817089'}}
