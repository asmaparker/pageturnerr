{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': "In The High–Purpose Company, corporate strategist and researcher Christine Arena shows that<br/>some extraordinary companies are driven by purpose, whereas others simply pretend to be. The High–Purpose Company draws a clear line in the sand, enabling readers to easily distinguish between these two groups––and make a giant leap forward.<br/>Using a groundbreaking methodology, Arena and her research team conducted thousands of hours of analysis on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of 75 well–known firms. The surprising results of the study defy long–held myths, rewrite rules, reframe strategic priorities, and reveal a new breed of business.<br/>Real CSR is about change, not charity. The High–Purpose Company uncovers this and other truths, and guides readers through the step–by–step process that is currently embraced by the world's most forward–thinking firms.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/78/9780060852078.jpg', 'title_long': 'The High-Purpose Company: The TRULY Responsible (and Highly Profitable) Firms That Are Changing Business Now', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.07585583856 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.07585583856}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006-12-26', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Business Culture', 'Ethics', 'Management & Leadership', 'Leadership & Motivation', 'Management', 'Skills', 'Communications', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Medical Ethics', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Ethics & Morality'], 'authors': ['Christine Arena'], 'title': 'The High-Purpose Company: The TRULY Responsible (and Highly Profitable) Firms That Are Changing Business Now', 'isbn13': '9780060852078', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'eBook': '0062010476', 'ePub': '0062010476'}, 'isbn': '0060852070', 'isbn10': '0060852070', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062010476', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
