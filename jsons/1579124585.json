{"book": {"publisher": "Black Dog & Leventhal", "synopsis": "First published in 1979 to extraordinary acclaim, Tom Wolfe’s landmark work became an instant bestseller, going on to sell more than 2.5 million copies. It is a true story that is as exciting as the best fiction—the tale of American heroes Yeager, Conrad, Grissom, and Glenn—men who were willing to put their lives on the line in pursuit of the final frontier.<br/><br/>With stunning accuracy and captivating prose, Wolfe recounts the details of the lives of these men, their families, and of NASA’s Project Mercury program. The result is a vivid history that could only be enhanced by actual historic photographs.<br/><br/>The Right Stuff Illustrated includes hundreds of photographs and reproductions of documents and memorabilia pertaining to the Project Mercury program, the current events surrounding the program, and the political climate that led up to the missions in the early 1960’s. It’s the perfect gift book for lovers of history and the space program, as well as the millions of fans of The Right Stuff.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/88/9781579124588.jpg", "title_long": "The Right Stuff: Illustrated", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 11.25 Inches, Length: 9.5 Inches, Weight: 3.42 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 3.42}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 11.25}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'History', 'Americas', 'Military', 'Science & Math', 'Astronomy & Space Science', 'Astronomy', 'Astrophysics & Space Science'], 'authors": ["Tom Wolfe'], 'title": "The Right Stuff: Illustrated", "isbn13": "9781579124588", "msrp": 35, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1579124585", "isbn10": "1579124585"}}
