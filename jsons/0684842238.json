{"book": {"publisher": "Scribner", "synopsis": "One of the most famous psychological studies of the late twentieth century, On Death and Dying grew out of an interdisciplinary seminar on death, originated and conducted by Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. In On Death and Dying, Dr. Kübler-Ross first introduced and explored the now-famous idea of the five stages of dealing with death: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. With sample interviews and conversations, she gives the reader a better understanding of how imminent death affects the patient, the professionals who serve the patient, and the patient"s family, bringing hope, solace, and peace of mind to all involved.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/33/9780684842233.jpg", "title_long": "On Death and Dying (Scribner Classics)", "edition": "Classic", "dimensions": "Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.9810570659 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.9}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.9810570659}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4375}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "1997-07-02", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Death & Grief', 'Grief & Bereavement', 'Relationships', 'Love & Loss', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Death'], 'authors": ["Elisabeth Kubler-Ross'], 'title": "On Death and Dying (Scribner Classics)", "isbn13": "9780684842233", "msrp": 10.89, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0684842238", "isbn10": "0684842238"}}
