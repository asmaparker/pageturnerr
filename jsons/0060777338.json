In The Cat\'s Pyjamas we are treated to a treasure trove of Bradbury gems old and new –– eerie and strange, nostalgic and bittersweet, searching and speculative –– all but two of which have never been published before. The Cat\'s Pyjamas is a joyous celebration of the lifelong work of a literary legend.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/73/33/9780060777333.jpg", "title_long": "The Cat"s Pajamas: Stories", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.58}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2005-07-26", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Metaphysical & Visionary', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Alternate History', 'Dystopian', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Ray Bradbury'], 'title": "The Cat"s Pajamas: Stories", 'isbn13": "9780060777333", "msrp": 9.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0062242296"}, "isbn": "0060777338", "isbn10": "0060777338", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780062242297", "binding": "print"}]}}
