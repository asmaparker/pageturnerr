{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Many of us make the wrong food choices every day by consuming foods that were never intended for our genetic makeup. According to renowned medical researcher David Heber, M.D., all of our most common major diseases are caused by the imbalance between our modern diet and our DNA, which was laid down more than 50,000 years ago.<br/>Now What Color Is Your Diet? introduces Dr. Heber\'s "Eat for Your Genes" food plans -- revolutionary approaches incorporating the latest breakthroughs in nutritional and genetic research -- and his unique 7 Colors of Health food-selection system, which groups fruits and vegetables by the colorful, beneficial chemical substances they contain. Dr. Heber shows you how to make the appropriate food choices to reduce your risks of heart disease, common forms of cancer, premature aging, and reduced vision and mental function -- and lose body fat at the same time.<br/>The typical American diet features the brown and beige colors of meat and starches -- with fruits and vegetables often nowhere in sight. While almost every food has some nutritional value, many are virtually devoid of the powerful colorful chemicals that can protect your genes, your vision, and your heart and reduce inflammation in your body, helping to prevent common forms of cancer and other diseases. Dr. Heber shows you how to benefit from the rainbow of colors contained in a nutritionally rich, DNA-compatible diet.
