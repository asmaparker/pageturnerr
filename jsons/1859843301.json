{"book": {"publisher": "Verso", "synopsis": "Since its original publication fifteen years ago, this hugely influential book has been at the centre of much debate. The arguments and controversies it has aroused are, furthermore, far from abating: the disintegration of the Soviet bloc, the emergence of new social and political identities linked to the transformation of late capitalism, and the crisis of a left-wing project whose essentialist underpinnings have increasingly come under fire have, if anything, made more relevant than ever the theoretical perspective that the book proposes. Moreover the political project of ‘radical and plural democracy’ that it advocates provides a much-needed antidote to the attempts to formulate a Third Way capable of overcoming the classical opposition between Left and Right.<br/><br/>Updated with a new preface, this is a fundamental text for understanding the workings of hegemony and grasping the nature of contemporary social struggles and their significance for democratic theory.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/07/9781859843307.jpg", "title_long": "Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics", "edition": "2nd", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.50926782522 Pounds, Width: 0.57 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.23}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.57}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.50926782522}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2001-06", "subjects": ["Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Political', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'Political Science'], 'authors": ["Ernesto Laclau', 'Chantal Mouffe'], 'title": "Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics", "isbn13": "9781859843307", "msrp": 22.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1781682089"}, "isbn": "1859843301", "isbn10": "1859843301", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781781682081", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
