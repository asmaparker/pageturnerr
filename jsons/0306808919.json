{"book": {"publisher": "Da Capo Press", "synopsis": "Long before Elvis Presley entered Sam Phillips"s Sun Records studio in 1954, rock "n" roll was being performed and recorded by the likes of Big Joe Turner, Louis Jordan, Wynonie Harris, the Clovers, the Dominoes, the Midnighters, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Wanda Jackson, and Johnny Ace. More than just a series of shrewd and evocative portraits of these and sixteen other performers, this book is also a paean to a forsaken time of relentless excess, sudden ruin, and fierce music. For this edition, the author has contributed a new listing of recent CD reissues. From 1945 to 1955, from Chinese hillbillies to Elvis's long-lost twin brother, here are the Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/13/9780306808913.jpg", "title_long": "Unsung Heroes Of Rock "n" Roll: The Birth Of Rock In The Wild Years Before Elvis', 'edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.78925489796 Pounds, Width: 0.67 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.67}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.78925489796}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "1999-05-07", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'History & Criticism', 'Musical Genres', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Composers & Musicians'], 'authors": ["Nick Tosches'], 'title": "Unsung Heroes Of Rock "n" Roll: The Birth Of Rock In The Wild Years Before Elvis', 'isbn13": "9780306808913", "msrp": 16.5, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0306808919", "isbn10": "0306808919"}}
