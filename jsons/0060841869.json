Not since Henry James, perhaps, has a fiction writer examined the process of writing with such insight, authority and range of reference and allusion.” —Russell Banks, New York Times Book Review<br/>“A magic curtain, woven of legends, hung before the world. Cervantes sent Don Quixote journeying and tore through the curtain. The world opened before the knight-errant in all the comical nakedness of its prose.”<br/>In this thought-provoking, endlessly enlightening, and entertaining essay on the art of the novel, renowned author Milan Kundera suggests that “the curtain” represents a ready-made perception of the world that each of us has—a pre-interpreted world. The job of the novelist, he argues, is to rip through the curtain and reveal what it hides.<br/>Here an incomparable literary artist cleverly sketches out his personal view of the history and value of the novel in Western civilization. In doing so, he celebrates a prose form that possesses the unique ability to transcend national and language boundaries in order to reveal some previously unknown aspect of human existence.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/67/9780060841867.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Curtain: An Essay in Seven Parts', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2007-01-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Movements & Periods'], 'authors': ['Milan Kundera'], 'title': 'The Curtain: An Essay in Seven Parts', 'isbn13': '9780060841867', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060841869', 'isbn10': '0060841869'}}
