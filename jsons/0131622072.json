The color-coded chapters, bold-print headings for each paragraph, and illustrations on nearly every page make it a treat for the eye. The writing is intelligent and covers a broader age range than most parenting books. Even though the standard, common-sense text is brief, it still nearly equals the coverage in Penelope Leach's Your Baby & Child: from Birth to Age Five ( LJ 9/1/78). There always seems to be room for one more book on childrearing. Recommended.
