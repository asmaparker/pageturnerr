{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt, Rinehart and Winston', 'synopsis': "Collins Pub. 'A young doctor accepts the post of assistant to a country G.P. and embarks on his new work with a freshness and enthusiasm that is most attractively illustrated in the entertaining incidents with which the book opens. But, when the young doctor meets Rochester's wife (and Rochester's terrible secret is disclosed) the story deepens to a dramatic intensity such as Miss Stevenson has rarely achieved. As a background there is all the humour and vexation of a country doctor's practice; there are scenes of lyrical beauty in Scotland where the two lovers wander over the open moors; there is the old doctor's grandson, Jem, surely one of the most truly delightful and captivating of all Miss Stevenson's characters; and, watching over everything there is the old doctor himself with his guiding wisdom and humorous understanding'.
