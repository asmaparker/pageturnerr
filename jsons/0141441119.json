{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": 'One of the greatest of all satires of the power of advertising and the modern press<br/><br/>Presented as a miraculous cure-all, Tono-Bungay is in fact nothing other than a pleasant-tasting liquid with no positive effects. Nonetheless, when the young George Ponderevo is employed by his Uncle Edward to help market this ineffective medicine, he finds his life overwhelmed by its sudden success. Soon, the worthless substance is turned into a formidable fortune, as society becomes convinced of the merits of Tono-Bungay through a combination of skilled advertising and public credulity. As the newly rich George discovers, however, there is far more to class in England than merely the possession of wealth.<br/><br/>This edition includes a newly established text, a full biographical essay on Wells, a list of further reading, and detailed notes. Edward Mendelsonâ€™s introduction explores the many ways in which Tono-Bungay satirizes the fictions and delusions that shape modern life.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
