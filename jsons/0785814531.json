{"book": {"publisher": "Castle Books", "synopsis": "In Edgar Allan Poe: Complete Tales and Poems, fans may indulge in all of Poeâ€™s most imaginative short-stories, including The Fall of the House of Usher, The Murders in Rue Morgue, The Tell-Tale Heart, Ligeia, and Ms. In a Bottle. His complete early and miscellaneous poetic masterpieces are here also, including The Raven, Ulalume, Annabel Lee, Tamerlane, as well as select reviews and narratives.<br/><br/>The life of American writer Edgar Allan Poe was characterized by a dramatic series of successes and failures, breakdowns and recoveries, personal gains and hopes dashed through, despite which he created some of the finest literature the world has ever known. Over time, his works have influenced such major creative forces as the French poets Charles Baudelaire and Andre Gide, filmmaker D.W. Griffith, and modern literary legend Allen Ginsberg. Best known for his poems and short fiction, Poe perfected the psychological thriller, invented the detective story, and rarely missed transporting the reader to his own supernatural realm. He has also been hailed posthumously as one of the finest literary critics of the nineteenth century.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/35/9780785814535.jpg", "title_long": "Edgar Allan Poe: Complete Tales and Poems", "edition": "2003 ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.9 Inches, Weight: 2.64113789876 Pounds, Width: 2.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.9}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.64113789876}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 864, "date_published": "2009-11-29", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'United States'], 'authors": ["Edgar Allan Poe'], 'title": "Edgar Allan Poe: Complete Tales and Poems", "isbn13": "9780785814535", "msrp": 12.99, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0785814531", "isbn10": "0785814531"}}
