She's had so many lousy dates that she's sure she's cursed. Why else would every man she goes out with suddenly act like he's lost his mind—and his manners? Adele thought life couldn't get any more confusing . . . until she learns the marriage of her seemingly Miss Perfect sister is on the rocks. So she goes back to their hometown to give her a shoulder to cry on, only to run smack into Zach Zemaitis . . . the one who got away.<br/>Texans love God, family, and football, though not always in that order<br/>Zach, a former pro star, knows all about football. As for the other two, well, he's doing his best. But when Adele comes charging back into his life—still all lush curves and beautiful, big blue eyes—he wonders if his best is good enough. After all, he did her wrong. Can a woman with her track record ever really believe that he's serious this time . . . or is he destined to be another bad date?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/47/9780061178047.jpg', 'title_long': 'Not Another Bad Date (Writer Friends, 4)', 'edition': 'F First American Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-05-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Humorous', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Sports'], 'authors': ['Rachel Gibson'], 'title': 'Not Another Bad Date (Writer Friends, 4)', 'isbn13': '9780061178047', 'msrp': 3.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061795879', 'ePub': '0061795879'}, 'isbn': '0061178047', 'isbn10': '0061178047', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061795879', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
