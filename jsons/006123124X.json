{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins US', 'synopsis': 'James Cordier is all blue blood and entirely dangerous. He\'s a master of disguise, a brilliant thief, a first-class lover—all for King and Country—and, by gad, he\'s so weary of it. His last mission is to "acquire" a packet of incriminating letters from one notorious woman. Then he can return to London and meet sweet-natured heiresses—not adventuresses and fallen women.<br/>Francesca Bonnard has weathered heartbreak, scorn, and scandal. She\'s independent, happy, and definitely fallen; and she\'s learned that "gentlemen" are more trouble than they\'re worth. She can also see that her wildly attractive new neighbor is bad news.<br/>But as bad as James is, there are others far worse also searching for Francesca\'s letters. And suddenly nothing is simple—especially the nearly incendiary chemistry between the two most jaded, sinful souls in Europe. And just as suddenly, risking everything may be worth the prize.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/47/9780061231247.jpg', 'title_long': 'Your Scandalous Ways', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.41005980732 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41005980732}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-05-27', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Loretta Chase'], 'title': 'Your Scandalous Ways', 'isbn13': '9780061231247', 'msrp': 4.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061801844', 'ePub': '0061801844'}, 'isbn': '006123124X', 'isbn10': '006123124X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061801846', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
