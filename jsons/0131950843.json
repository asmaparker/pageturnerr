{'book': {'publisher': 'Pearson', 'synopsis': 'The highly anticipated second edition of Understanding by Design poses the core, essential questions of understanding and design, and provides readers with practical solutions for the teacher-designer. The book opens by analyzing the logic of backward design as an alternative to coverage and activity-oriented plans. Though backward from habit, this approach brings more focus and coherence to instruction. The book proposes a multifaceted approach, with the six “facets” of understanding. The facets combine with backward design to provide a powerful, expanded array of practical tools and strategies for designing curriculum, instruction, and assessments that lead students at all grade levels to genuine understanding.<br/><br/>The second edition, a refined work, has been thoroughly and extensively revised, updated, and expanded, including improvement of the UbD Template, the key terms of UbD, dozens of worksheets, and some of the larger concepts. The authors have successfully put together a text that demonstrates what best practice in the design of learning looks like, enhancing for its audience their capability for creating more engaging and effective learning, whether the student is a third grader, a college freshman, or a faculty member.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/49/9780131950849.jpg', 'title_long': 'Understanding by Design, Expanded 2nd Edition(Package May Vary)', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.9 Inches, Length: 8.2 Inches, Weight: 1.50796187208 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.50796187208}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.9}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-07-14', 'subjects': ['Test Preparation', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Education Theory', 'Curriculum & Lesson Plans', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Grant Wiggins', 'Jay McTighe'], 'title': 'Understanding by Design, Expanded 2nd Edition(Package May Vary)', 'isbn13': '9780131950849', 'msrp': 32.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0131950843', 'isbn10': '0131950843'}}
