His name was Joseph Valachi. Daring to break the Mob\'s code of silence for the first time, Valachi detailed the organization of organized crime from the capos, or bosses, of every Family, to the hit men who "clipped" rivals and turncoats. With a phenomenal memory for names, dates, addresses, phone numbers—and where the bodies were buried—Joe Valachi provided the chilling facts that led to the arrest and conviction of America\'s major crime figures.<br/>The rest is history.<br/>Never again would the Mob be protected by secrecy. For the Mafia, Valachi\'s name would become synonymous with betrayal. But his stunning exposé broke the back of America\'s Cosa Nostra and stands today as the classic about America\'s Mob, a fascinating tale of power and terror, big money, crime. . . and murder.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/28/9780060507428.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Valachi Papers', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.49 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2003-03-18', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Crime & Criminal Biographies', 'Espionage', 'Murder & Mayhem', 'Organized Crime', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology'], 'authors': ['Peter Maas'], 'title': 'The Valachi Papers', 'isbn13': '9780060507428', 'msrp': 11.37, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '006050742X', 'isbn10': '006050742X'}}
