Shortly afterwards she was viciously attacked by a stalker, left disfigured, and forced to give up what was most precious to her for the chance of a new life for them both. Now, Eva has managed to rebuild her life in a way that seemed impossible after the attack.

The love she shares with her husband, Don, has become the very mainstay of her existence. Her beloved sister, Patty, lives nearby. To an outsider, Eva's world seems perfect in every way.

Hurt, frightened, and confused, Eva wonders if she'll ever be able to break free from a past that nearly destroyed her\x97and is threatening to do so again.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/86/9780099550686.jpg', 'title_long': 'No Turning Back', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1794731017 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1794731017}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 394, 'date_published': '2011-06-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Sisters', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors': ['Susan Lewis'], 'title': 'No Turning Back', 'isbn13': '9780099550686', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099550687', 'isbn10': '0099550687'}}
