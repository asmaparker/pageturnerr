No one had ever made her feel as cherished or desirable, and she’d never had so much fun, but even though her eccentric boarder, Elsie, assured her that where Kate was concerned Dave had plenty of ambition, could she really love a guy who was just smart, sexy and rich?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/53/9780060598853.jpg', 'title_long': 'Back to the Bedroom', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.64}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2014-02-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'Feel-Good', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Janet Evanovich'], 'title': 'Back to the Bedroom', 'isbn13': '9780060598853', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061797553', 'ePub': '0061797553'}, 'isbn': '0060598859', 'isbn10': '0060598859', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061797552', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
