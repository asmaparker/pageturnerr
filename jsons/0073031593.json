{'book': {'publisher': 'McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages', 'synopsis': 'COLLEGE 101 is a thematically arranged reader designed to provide first-year students with a solid foundation for reflecting on -- and making the most of -- their college experience. The readings, -- which include professional essays, student essays, poems, short stories, letters, and a play, -- address issues of direct relevance to first-year students. The probing questions for discussion and suggestions for journal entries that accompany each reading encourage students to examine these critical issues, and help them to develop the skills necessary for making good decisions and growing as individuals. While retaining the best features of the first edition, the second edition of COLLEGE 101 includes more emphasis on specially academic issues, a greater focus on diversity, and consideration of the impact of the Internet in school and in our lives.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/90/9780073031590.jpg', 'title_long': 'College 101: A First Year Reader', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 294, 'date_published': '1998-06-23', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Student Life', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Lawry,John'], 'title': 'College 101: A First Year Reader', 'isbn13': '9780073031590', 'msrp': 59.65, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0073031593', 'isbn10': '0073031593'}}
