{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': "“[Ginsberg's] poignant, gently written stories of waitressing are metaphors for life.” —Dallas Morning News<br/><br/>A veteran waitress dishes up a spicy and robust account of life as it really exists behind kitchen doors.<br/>Part memoir, part social commentary, part guide to how to behave when dining out, Debra Ginsberg's book takes readers on her twenty-year journey as a waitress at a soap-operatic Italian restaurant, an exclusive five-star dining club, the dingiest of diners, and more. While chronicling her evolution as a writer, Ginsberg takes a behind-the-scenes look at restaurant life—revealing that yes, when pushed, a server will spit in food, and, no, that's not really decaf you're getting—and how most people in this business are in a constant state of waiting to do something else.<br/>Colorful, insightful, and often irreverent, Ginsberg's stories truly capture the spirit of the universal things she's learned about human nature, interpersonal relationships, the frightening things that go on in the kitchen, romantic hopes dashed and rebuilt, and all of the frustrating and funny moments in this life. Waiting is for everyone who has had to wait for their life to begin—only to realize, suddenly, that they're living it.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/96/9780060194796.jpg', 'title_long': 'Waiting : The True Confessions of a Waitress', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2000-07-03', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Culinary', 'Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Cooking'], 'authors': ['Debra Ginsberg'], 'title': 'Waiting : The True Confessions of a Waitress', 'isbn13': '9780060194796', 'msrp': 22, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060194790', 'isbn10': '0060194790'}}
