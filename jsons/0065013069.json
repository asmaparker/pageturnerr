{'book': {'publisher': 'Harpercollins College Div', 'synopsis': 'This reader integrates different approaches to the study of women and politics. The first approach focuses on women\'s role in traditional political activities - as voters, party activists and candidates for legislative office. This includes current issues, such as the development of the "gender gap" in attitudes and the constraints on women\'s participation. The second approach compares the impact of women\'s movements and campaigns to change public policy on issues such as sexual harassment, childcare and abortion. The third examines the omission and subordination of women in political thought, and issues of feminist theory and methodology. Throughout, this book reflects the diversity of women\'s involvement in political life, within and between developed countries.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/61/9780065013061.jpg', 'title_long': 'Different Roles, Different Voices: Women and Politics in the United States and Europe', 'edition': 'Facsimile, Subsequent', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.8377565956 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8377565956}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 277, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science', 'Specific Topics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Marianne Githens', 'Pippa Norris'], 'title': 'Different Roles, Different Voices: Women and Politics in the United States and Europe', 'isbn13': '9780065013061', 'msrp': 41, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0065013069', 'isbn10': '0065013069'}}
