{'book': {'publisher': 'Brooks Cole', 'synopsis': "The authors present the principles of human biology and apply them to students' lives, helping them realize the benefits of understanding the material. Judy Goodenough has taught human biology for over fifteen years and, along with her co-authors, has written a text with three basic goals: to provide information that will help students understand their everyday experiences with their bodies and the world around them, to help students understand how their actions affect their quality of life (in terms of their personal health, society and the welfare of the planet), and to help students develop reasoning skills they can further apply to life. An accompanying Web site provides a full range of instructor's support materials to help in teaching the course.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/15/9780030012815.jpg', 'title_long': 'Human Biology : Personal, Environmental, and Social Concerns', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 3.66187817182 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.66187817182}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.75}}, 'pages': 629, 'date_published': '1997-10-10', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Judith Goodenough', 'Robert A.
