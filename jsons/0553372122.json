{"book": {"publisher": "Bantam", "synopsis": "Say “the Sixties” and the images start coming, images of a time when all authority was defied and millions of young Americans thought they could change the world—either through music, drugs, and universal love or by “putting their bodies on the line” against injustice and war.<br/><br/>Todd Gitlin, the highly regarded writer, media critic, and professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, has written an authoritative and compelling account of this supercharged decade—a decade he helped shape as an early president of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and an organizer of the first national demonstration against the Vietnam war. Part critical history, part personal memoir, part celebration, and part meditation, this critically acclaimed work resurrects a generation on all its glory and tragedy.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/20/9780553372120.jpg", "title_long": "The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage", "edition": "Revised", "dimensions": "Height: 9 inches, Length: 6 inches, Weight: 1.63803460666 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.63803460666}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 544, "date_published": "1993-07-01", "subjects": ["History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural'], 'authors": ["Todd Gitlin'], 'title": "The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage", "isbn13": "9780553372120", "msrp": 21, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307834026"}, "isbn": "0553372122", "isbn10": "0553372122", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307834027", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
