{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "A newly revised edition of an American classic, Sam Shepard’s Pulitzer Prize—winning Buried Child is as fierce and unforgettable as it was when it was first produced in 1978.<br/><br/>A scene of madness greets Vince and his girlfriend as they arrive at the squalid farmhouse of Vince’s hard-drinking grandparents, who seem to have no idea who he is. Nor does his father, Tilden, a hulking former All-American footballer, or his uncle, who has lost one of his legs to a chain saw. Only the memory of an unwanted child, buried in an undisclosed location, can hope to deliver this family from its sin.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/77/9780307274977.jpg", "title_long": "Buried Child", "edition": "Revised", "dimensions": "Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.24912235606 Pounds, Width: 0.34 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.34}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.24912235606}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.9}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2006-02-14", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Dysfunctional Families', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Rural', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Sam Shepard'], 'title": "Buried Child", "isbn13": "9780307274977", "msrp": 13.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307494276"}, "isbn": "0307274977", "isbn10": "0307274977", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307494276", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
