{"book": {"publisher": "Recorded Books, Inc.", "synopsis": "Born over 2,400 years ago, warrior, thinker, and leader Sun Tzu lived during a time of great internecine conflict in China. A classic of Chinese literature, Art of War reveals the strategies, tactics, and insights that lead to success. Mastery of warfare and the maintenance of power are the most important values in Sun"s philosophy--without which there can be no peace or life. According to Sun, studying your enemy, detecting his weakness, allowing him to expose himself and then acting accordingly is the key to success. But, it is perhaps even more important to master the skill of winning without fighting. Sun"s battle-proven strategies have been put into practice by countless leaders--from Mao Tse-tung to Napoleon to the planners of Operation Desert Storm. Filled with practical wisdom and strategy Art of War is an indispensable guide for anyone who want an edge over the competition. With powerful narration by George Guidall and Joe Mantegna, listeners are sure to be destined for greatness with this book.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/16/9781402561016.jpg", "title_long": "The Art of War", "edition": "Unabridged", "dimensions": "Height: 5.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.29 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.29}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.75}}, "pages": 5, "date_published": "2003-06-11", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Business Development & Entrepreneurship', 'Small Business', 'Politics & Social Sciences'], 'authors": ["Sun Tzu'], 'title": "The Art of War", "isbn13": "9781402561016", "msrp": 19.99, 'binding": "Audio CD", "isbn": "1402561016", "isbn10": "1402561016"}}
