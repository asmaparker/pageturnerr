{"book": {"publisher": "Orb Books", "synopsis": "Walker Easterling is a retired actor turned successful screenwriter living in the Vienna of strong coffee, fascinating friends, and mysterious cafes. When he falls in love with Maris York, a beautiful artist who creates cities, his life becomes alive in fantastic and unsettling ways. As Walker"s love for Maris grows, his life gets more and more bizarre-he discovers he can see things happening just before they happen, and at the same time feels an incredibly strong tug from his past-so a friend steers him to Venasque, an odd little man reputed to be a powerful shaman. Venasque helps Walker discover and unravel his many interconnected past lives, and it is soon clear that an unresolved conflict from these past lives has resurfaced, and now threatens to undo Walker and Maris"s love.<br/><br/>At once lyrical, frightening, funny, and sexy, Sleeping in Flame is a spellbinding tale where reality and fantasy merge in astonishing convolutions of magic and suspense. It confirms that Jonathan Carroll is one of the very few novelists who-by constantly surprising us-give us an entirely new perspective on our world. It is no wonder that he is generally considered to be the most original and provocative novelist of his generation.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/63/9780765311863.jpg", "title_long": "Sleeping in Flame (Answered Prayers, 2)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.6818884 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6818884}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2004-10-01", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Magical Realism'], 'authors": ["Jonathan Carroll'], 'title": "Sleeping in Flame (Answered Prayers, 2)", "isbn13": "9780765311863", "msrp": 13.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0765311860", "isbn10": "0765311860"}}
