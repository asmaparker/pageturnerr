{"book": {"publisher": "Banner of Truth", "synopsis": "There are few more important things in the Christian"s life than discovering God"s will. The assurance that we are in the centre of God"s purposes brings lasting stability to our experience.<br/>But how do we discover the will of God for our lives?<br/><br/>Sinclair Ferguson answers this question by showing how God's will is shaped by his ultimate purposes for us. It is made known to us through his Word. At times discovering God's will demands careful thought: it may require patience; it always demands a right attitude to God himself.<br/><br/>Discovering God's Will draws out fundamental principles by which God guides us, applies them to practical situations like vocation and marriage, and underlines many important biblical counsels. It shows that the guidance God gives comes primarily through knowing, loving and obeying him.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/48/9780851513348.jpg", "title_long": "Discovering God"s Will", 'edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.75 Inches, Weight: 0.26896395964 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.26896395964}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 126, "date_published": "1982-02-01", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["Sinclair B.
