{"book": {"publisher": "Washington Square Press", "synopsis": "New Orleans, 1920s. Raziela Nolan is in the throes of a magnificent love affair when she dies in a tragic accident. In an instant, she leaves behind her one true love and her dream of becoming a doctor -- but somehow, she still remains. Immediately after her death, Razi chooses to stay between -- a realm that exists after life and before whatever lies beyond it.<br/><br/>From this remarkable vantage point, Razi narrates the stories of her lost love, Andrew, and the relationship of Amy and Scott, a couple whose house she haunts almost seventy-five years later. The Mercy of Thin Air entwines these two fateful and redemptive love stories that echo across three generations. From ambitious, forward-thinking Razi, who illegally slips birth control guides into library books; to hip Web designer Amy, who begins to fall off the edge of grief; to Eugenia, caught between since the Civil War, the characters in this wondrous novel sing with life. Evoking the power of love, memory, and time, The Mercy of Thin Air culminates in a startling finish that will leave readers breathless.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/29/9780743278829.jpg", "title_long": "The Mercy of Thin Air: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.3333 Inches, Weight: 0.63 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.3333}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.63}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2006-06-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Horror', 'Women's Fiction', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Ronlyn Domingue'], 'title": "The Mercy of Thin Air: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780743278829", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1416524657"}, "isbn": "0743278828", "isbn10": "0743278828", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781416524656", "binding": "print"}]}}
