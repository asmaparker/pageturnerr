{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Sinfully decadent Anthony Kennington, Viscount Hastings, lives for pleasure--and he rues the day when he must wed and produce an heir. But he is not a man who runs from danger, and when he chances upon an enchanting gypsy maiden in the woods hounded by bandits, he leaps to her defense. Now, surely, there is but one place for the injured and unconscious lovely to properly recuperate: in his bed.<br/><br/>Sabrina is shocked when she awakens in an opulent bedchamber, nursed in every way by a dashing gentleman. She knows she must leave the haven of Anthony's home at once, even though her life is still in grave danger--though a different kind of peril awaits her in the viscount's arms. If Sabrina surrenders to this handsome rogue, she will be an outcast. Yet does she dare ignore the future that's written on his palm--the promise of a shared lifetime of love and ecstasy?<br/><br/>***This is a first edition from Avon Books, 2006. This edition is OUT OF PRINT. A second edition is now available!***", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/37/9780060847937.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Forbidden Love', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 375, 'date_published': '2005-12-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Alexandra Benedict'], 'title': 'A Forbidden Love', 'isbn13': '9780060847937', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '006084793X', 'isbn10': '006084793X'}}
