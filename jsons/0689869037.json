{"book": {"publisher": "Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers", "synopsis": "You could say that my railroad, the Madham Line, is almost the most important thing in my life. Next to Andy Morrow, my best friend.<br/><br/>Lots of people think Doug Hanson is a freak -- he gets beat up after school, and the girl of his dreams calls him a worm. Doug"s only refuge is creating an elaborate bridge for the model railroad in his basement and hanging out with his best friend, Andy Morrow, a popular football star who could date any girl in school. Doug and Andy talk about everything -- except what happened at the Tuttle place a few years back.<br/><br/>It does not matter to Andy that we live in completely different realities. I"m Andy"s best friend. It does not matter to Andy that we hardly ever actually do anything together.<br/><br/>As Doug retreats deeper and deeper into his own reality, long-buried secrets threaten to destroy both Doug and Andy -- and everything else in Doug's fragile world.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/37/9780689869037.jpg", "title_long": "Invisible", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.32 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.32}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 149, "date_published": "2006-11-28", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Loners & Outcasts'], 'authors": ["Pete Hautman'], 'title": "Invisible", "isbn13": "9780689869037", "msrp": 16.14, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1439107041", "ePub": "1439107041"}, "isbn": "0689869037", "isbn10": "0689869037", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781439107041", "binding": "print"}]}}
