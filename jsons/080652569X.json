{"book": {"publisher": "Citadel", "synopsis": "Dear Stupid Idiots,<br/><br/>A lot of you have been saying that I don’t know anything about REAL ninjas. But that’s a bunch of bull crap! You dummies don’t know anything. And maybe YOU should get a life. I bet a lot of you have never even seen a girl naked! You idiots believe that ninjas had some “code of honor.” Yeah right! If by “code of honor,” you mean “code to flip out and go nuts for absolutely no reason at all even if it means that people might think you are totally insane or sweet,” then you are right. But if you mean a “code to be nice and speak nicely while sharing and not cutting off heads,” then you’re the biggest idiot ever!!!!!! So if you have any brains, you will shut up and get a life. So go shut up, you stupid idiot.<br/><br/>No thank you,<br/><br/>Robert Hamburger", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/93/9780806525693.jpg", "title_long": "REAL Ultimate Power: The Official Ninja Book", "edition": "Later Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.54 Inches, Weight: 0.52029093832 pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.54}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.65}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.52029093832}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.2}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2004-07-01", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Computers & Internet', 'Sports', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Miscellaneous', 'Essays', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture'], 'authors": ["Robert Hamburger'], 'title": "REAL Ultimate Power: The Official Ninja Book", "isbn13": "9780806525693", "msrp": 9, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "080652569X", "isbn10": "080652569X"}}
