{"book": {"publisher": "Charles Scribner"s Sons", "synopsis": "Hemingway"s classic novel of the First World War<br/>The best American novel to emerge from World War I, A Farewell to Arms is the unforgettable story of an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his passion for a beautiful English nurse. Hemingway"s frank portrayal of the love between Lieutenant Henry and Catherine Barkley, caught in the inexorable sweep of war, glows with an intensity unrivaled in modern literature, while his description of the German attack on Caporetto of lines of fired men marching in the rain, hungry, weary, and demoralized is one of the greatest moments in literary history. A story of love and pain, of loyalty and desertion, A Farewell to Arms, written when he was 30 years old, represents a new romanticism for Hemingway.<br/>Ernest Hemingway did more to change the style of English prose than any other writer in the twentieth century, and for his efforts he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954. Hemingway wrote in short, declarative sentences and was known for his tough, terse prose. Publication of The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms immediately established Ernest Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century. As part of the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, the former journalist and World War I ambulance driver began a career that lead to international fame. Hemingway was an aficionado of bullfighting and big-game hunting, and his main protagonists were always men and women of courage and conviction, who suffered unseen scars, both physical and emotional. He covered the Spanish Civil War, portraying it in fiction in his brilliantnovel For Whom the Bell Tolls, and he subsequently covered World War II. His classic novella The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. He died in 1961.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/93/9780684174693.jpg", "title_long": "Farewell to Arms", "edition": "Scribner Classic Ed", "dimensions": "Weight: 1.543235834 Pounds", "dimensions_structured": {"weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.543235834}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "1982", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'War'], 'authors": ["Ernest Hemingway'], 'title": "Farewell to Arms", "isbn13": "9780684174693", "msrp": 5.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0684174693", "isbn10": "0684174693"}}
