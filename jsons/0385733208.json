{"book": {"publisher": "Delacorte Books for Young Readers", "synopsis": "Before this all happened, the closest I"d ever come to getting physical with a guy was playing the board game Operation. Okay, so maybe that sounds pathetic, but it"s not like there were any guys at my high school who I cared to share more than three words with, let alone my body.<br/><br/>Then I met Wes, a track star senior from across town. Maybe it was his soulful blue eyes, or maybe my hormones just started raging. Either way, I was hooked. And after a while, he was too. I couldn"t believe how intense my feelings became, or the fact that I was seeing—and touching—parts of the body I'd only read about in my Gray's Anatomy textbook.

It was love.<br/><br/>And then came the fall.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/05/9780385733205.jpg", "title_long": "Anatomy of a Boyfriend", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.49 Inches, Length: 8.95 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.95}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.97}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.9}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.49}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2007-01-09", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Daria Snadowsky'], 'title": "Anatomy of a Boyfriend", "isbn13": "9780385733205", "msrp": 16.99, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0385733208", "isbn10": "0385733208"}}
