{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 14: Molecular Connectivity in Chemistry and Drug Research is a 10-chapter text that focuses on the molecular connectivity approach for quantitative evaluation of molecular structure of drugs. Molecular connectivity is a nonempirical derivation of numerical value that encode within them sufficient information to relate to many physicochemical and biological properties. This book outlines first the development of molecular connectivity approach, followed by considerable chapters on its application to evaluation of physicochemical properties of drugs. Other chapters explore the application of molecular connectivity to structure-activity studies in medicinal chemistry. The final chapters provide some reflections, challenges, and potential areas of investigation of molecular connectivity. Advanced undergraduate or graduate students in medicinal chemistry or pharmacology, practicing scientists, and theoretical chemists will find this book invaluable.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/04/9780124065604.jpg', 'title_long': 'Molecular Connectivity in Chemistry and Drug Research', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.5070632026 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5070632026}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '1976-01-15', 'subjects': ['Physical & Theoretical', 'General', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Chemistry -> Physical Chemistry', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Chemistry -> General Chemistry'], 'authors': ['Lemont Kier'], 'title': 'Molecular Connectivity in Chemistry and Drug Research', 'isbn13': '9780124065604', 'msrp': 72.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0124065600', 'isbn10': '0124065600', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780323158312', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
