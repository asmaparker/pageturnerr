{"book": {"publisher": "Firebird", "synopsis": "Master storyteller Robin McKinley here spins two new fairy tales and retells two cherished classics. All feature princesses touched with or by magic. There is Linadel, who lives in a kingdom next to Faerieland, where princesses are stolen away on their seventeenth birthdays-and Linadel"s seventeenth birthday is tomorrow. And Korah, whose brother is bewitched by the magical Golden Hind; now it is up to her to break the spell. Rana must turn to a talking frog to help save her kingdom from the evil Aliyander. And then there are the twelve princesses, enspelled to dance through the soles of their shoes every night. . . . These are tales to read with delight!", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/04/9780698119604.jpg", "title_long": "The Door in the Hedge", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.73 Inches, Length: 5.06 Inches, Weight: 0.38 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.06}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.62}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.38}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.73}}, "pages": 216, "date_published": "2003-10-13", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Robin Mckinley'], 'title": "The Door in the Hedge", "isbn13": "9780698119604", "msrp": 6.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0698119606", "isbn10": "0698119606"}}
