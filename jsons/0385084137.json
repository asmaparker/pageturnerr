{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "This book is based on talks by Ram Dass at the Menninger Foundation in 1970 and at the Spring Grove Hospital in Maryland in 1972. The text grew out of the interaction between Ram Dass and the spiritual seekers in attendance at these talks.<br/><br/>The result of this unique exchange is a useful guide for understanding the nature of consciousness--useful both to other spiritual seekers and to formally trained psychologists. It is also a celebration of the Dance of Life--which, in the words of Ram Dass, is the "only dance there is."", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/30/9780385084130.jpg", "title_long": "The Only Dance There Is: Talks at the Menninger Foundation, 1970, and Spring Grove Hospital, 1972 (Doubleday Anchor Original)", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.3747858454 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.3747858454}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.2}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "1974-04-05", "subjects": ["Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Hinduism', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Chakras', 'Spiritualism', 'Occult & Paranormal', 'Parapsychology', 'Other Eastern Religions & Sacred Texts', 'Religious Studies', 'Psychology', 'Medical Books', 'General'], 'authors": ["Ram Dass'], 'title": "The Only Dance There Is: Talks at the Menninger Foundation, 1970, and Spring Grove Hospital, 1972 (Doubleday Anchor Original)", "isbn13": "9780385084130", "msrp": 11.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "030777872X"}, "isbn": "0385084137", "isbn10": "0385084137", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307778727", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
