Bold words are always used to describe English war hero Captain Chase Eversea, but another word unfortunately plays a role in every Eversea's destiny: trouble. And trouble for Chase arrives in the form of a mysterious message summoning him to a London rendezvous . . . where he encounters the memory of his most wicked indiscretion in the flesh: Rosalind Marchâ€”the only woman he could never forget.<br/>A Woman of Passion. . .<br/>Five years ago, the reckless, charming beauty craved the formidable Captain's attention. But now Rosalind is a coolly self-possessed woman, and desire is the last thing on her mind: her sister has mysteriously disappeared and she needs Chase's help to find her. But as their search through London's darkest corners re-ignites long-smoldering passion and memories of old battles, Chase and Rosalind are challenged to surrender: to the depths of a wicked desire, and to the possibility of love.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/18/9780061341618.jpg', 'title_long': 'Since the Surrender (Pennyroyal Green Series)', 'edition': 'Original', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.40565056208 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.40565056208}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2009-07-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency', 'Military'], 'authors': ['Julie Anne Long'], 'title': 'Since the Surrender (Pennyroyal Green Series)', 'isbn13': '9780061341618', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061893595'}, 'isbn': '0061341614', 'isbn10': '0061341614', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061893599', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
