{"book": {"publisher": "McGraw-Hill College", "synopsis": "An exhilarating meditation on nature and its seasonsâ€”a personal narrative highlighting one year"s exploration on foot in the author"s own neighborhood in Tinker Creek, Virginia. In the summer, Dillard stalks muskrats in the creek and contemplates wave mechanics; in the fall she watches a monarch butterfly migration and dreams of Arctic caribou. She tries to con a coot; she collects pond water and examines it under a microscope. She unties a snake skin, witnesses a flood, and plays "King of the Meadow' with a field of grasshoppers.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/41/70/9780072434170.jpg", "title_long": "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek", "edition": "0025-Anniversary", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 2.7 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "2000", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ['Annie Dillard'], 'title": "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek", "isbn13": "9780072434170", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0072434171", "isbn10": "0072434171"}}
