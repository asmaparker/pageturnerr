Men who read it will surely learn much about themselves, and women—particularly those who are unfortunately misled into thinking of men as “the enemy”—will find it a real eye-opener.”—Ruth Tiffany Barnhouse, M.D., Th.M., Harvard University<br/>Robert A. Johnson's classic work exploring the differences between man and woman, female and male—newly reissued.<br/>What does it really mean to be a man? What are some of the landmarks along the road to mature masculinity? And what of the feminine components of a man's personality?<br/>Women have developed, over the centuries, considerable expertise in the technique of adapting to men, and for good reason, but that is not the same as truly understanding them. The transition from male childhood to real manhood is a complicated struggle, and explored in this book.<br/>As timely today as when it was first published, He provides a fascinating look into male identity and how female dynamics influence men.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/65/9780060963965.jpg', 'title_long': 'He: Understanding Masculine Psychology (Perennial Library)', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Width: 0.216216 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.216216}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '1989-11-01', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Sexuality', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Behavioral Psychology', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'General', 'Movements'], 'authors': ['Robert A.
