{"book": {"publisher": "NYRB Classics", "synopsis": "Mattia Pascal endures a life of drudgery in a provincial town. Then, providentially, he discovers that he has been declared dead. Realizing he has a chance to start over, to do it right this time, he moves to a new city, adopts a new name, and a new course of lifeâ€”only to find that this new existence is as insufferable as the old one. But when he returns to the world he left behind, it"s too late: his job is gone, his wife has remarried. Mattia Pascal"s fate is to live on as the ghost of the man he was.<br/><br/>An explorer of identity and its mysteries, a connoisseur of black humor, Nobel Prize winner Luigi Pirandello is among the most teasing and profound of modern masters. The Late Mattia Pascal, here rendered into English by the outstanding translator William Weaver, offers an irresistible introduction to this great writer"s work', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/58/9781590171158.jpg", "title_long": "The Late Mattia Pascal", "edition": "Translation", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.5180863157 Pounds, Width: 0.55 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.55}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5180863157}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2004-11-30", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Absurdist', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Luigi Pirandello'], 'title": "The Late Mattia Pascal", "isbn13": "9781590171158", "msrp": 11.56, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1590171152", "isbn10": "1590171152"}}
