Most poignant of all is the appearance of so many characters who will fight under opposing flags 13 years later. Stonewall Jackson shows up as a humorless young lieutenant with a spiritual reverence for his artillery, and Ulysses S. Grant awkwardly meets [Robert E.] Lee. . . . The salvaging of such episodes from history is ultimately a patriotic task, deserving of gratitude.'<br/>--The Washington Post Book World<br/><br/>'COMPELLING . . . THRILLING . . . Shaara briskly drives the U.S. forces to Mexico City, building suspense at each battle, all towards the climactic storming of the gates of the capital. . . . [He] has humanized the mythos of Lee as no one ever has and, in doing, makes an enduring contribution to literature.'<br/>--Civil War Book Review<br/><br/>'SHAARA, AS USUAL, IS AT HIS BEST IN ACTION AND CONFRONTATION AND IN EVOKING HOW IT FELT TO BE THERE.'<br/>--The Philadelphia Inquirer', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/19/9780345427519.jpg", "title_long": "Gone for Soldiers: A Novel of the Mexican War", "edition": "NO-VALUE", "dimensions": "Height: 8.17 Inches, Length: 5.48 Inches, Weight: 0.72532084198 Pounds, Width: 0.91 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.48}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.91}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.72532084198}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.17}}, "pages": 424, "date_published": "2001-07-03", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'War', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Military', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Jeff Shaara'], 'title": "Gone for Soldiers: A Novel of the Mexican War", "isbn13": "9780345427519", "msrp": 17, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345427513", "isbn10": "0345427513"}}
