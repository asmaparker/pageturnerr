{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "In 1952 and 1953 as he wandered around America, Jack Kerouac jotted down spontaneous prose poems, or "sketches" as he called them, on small notebooks that he kept in his shirt pockets. The poems recount his travels—New York, North Carolina, Lowell (Massachusetts, Kerouac’s birthplace), San Francisco, Denver, Kansas, Mexico—observations, and meditations on art and life. The poems are often strung together so that over the course of several of them, a little story—or travelogue—appears, complete in itself. Published for the first time, Book of Sketches offers a luminous, intimate, and transcendental glimpse of one of the most original voices of the twentieth century at a key time in his literary and spiritual development.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/21/55/9780142002155.jpg", "title_long": "Book of Sketches (Penguin Poets)", "edition": "Later Printing Used", "dimensions": "Height: 6.1 Inches, Length: 4.7 Inches, Weight: 0.61949895622 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.7}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.61949895622}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.1}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2006-04-04", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Poetry', 'Themes & Styles', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Jack Kerouac'], 'title": "Book of Sketches (Penguin Poets)", "isbn13": "9780142002155", "msrp": 18, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1440626499"}, "isbn": "0142002151", "isbn10": "0142002151", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781440626494", "binding": "print"}]}}
