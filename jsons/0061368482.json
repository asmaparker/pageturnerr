{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Short of spending every waking hour engaged in antiaging treatments, is there anything the average woman can do to shave even a few months from her appearance? Do any of the miracle creams, procedures, or magic potions actually make a person look more youthful? Does a woman have to worry about her nasolabial folds if she doesn't even know where they're located on her body? Veteran journalist Beth Teitell aims to find the answers to these questions and many more in her hilarious travels looking for the elusive elixir of youth.<br/>If you feel bad about your neck (or any other body part), if the idea of Botox-filled syringes fills you with horror, if you don't want to empty your wallet to pay for $475 serums that promise to cheer up aging skin or the hourly cost of a facial-fitness coach, or if you don't believe the claims of antiaging gummy bears or age-defying bottled water, then Drinking Problems at the Fountain of Youth is the book for you. There's not a woman in America who won't see herself in Teitell's struggles or come away feeling that the enormous amount of energy, time, and money we spend trying to restore our bodies to the way they were when we were twenty could be better spent elsewhere.<br/>With honesty, outrage, and wit, Teitell goes deep into the youth-at-any-cost culture and takes it apart from the inside out. And then she reassures us that there is hope—there are things we can do to look and feel younger, and ways we can learn to stop worrying about looking older.<br/>Drinking Problems at the Fountain of Youth is for every woman who isn't as young as she used to be—a book of wisdom and advice, and a laugh-out-loud look at our age-obsessed culture.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/86/9780061368486.jpg', 'title_long': 'Drinking Problems at the Fountain of Youth', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.88 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.88}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2008-10-07', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Beauty, Grooming, & Style', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors': ['Beth Teitell'], 'title': 'Drinking Problems at the Fountain of Youth', 'isbn13': '9780061368486', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061981923'}, 'isbn': '0061368482', 'isbn10': '0061368482', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061981920', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
