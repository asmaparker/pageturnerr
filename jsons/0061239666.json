Kate Lyle is a headstrong young woman desperate to escape a sexually predatory household. Both are Anglo-Indians, members of a race that helped turn the wheels of Empire for years. But Empire days are numbered, and as India sheds its colonial skin, the young lovers must face their own tryst with destiny.<br/>In twenty-first-century England, Owen Monroe is writing this story of his parents' lives in an effort to avoid the problems in his own: lost love, relentless libido, dreams of death, and a world full of headlines he can't understand and doesn't want to. But keeping past and present apart isn't as easy as it seems, and before long Owen is deep in the one story he never wanted to tell....<br/>Epic in its scope yet never losing sight of the telling, gorgeous detail, The Bloodstone Papers is an extraordinarily rich and beautiful read that manages to ask the big questions without fuss and to accept that the big answers aren't always what we want to hear.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/63/9780061239663.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Bloodstone Papers', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.455 Pounds, Width: 1.41 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.41}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.455}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2007-07-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Glen Duncan'], 'title': 'The Bloodstone Papers', 'isbn13': '9780061239663', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061239666', 'isbn10': '0061239666'}}
