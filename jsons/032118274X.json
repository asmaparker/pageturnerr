{"book": {"publisher": "Pearson", "synopsis": "The Longman Cultural Editions series presents the only paperback edition of both parts of Henry IV published in one volume, together with relevant literary and historical contextual materials that illluminate without overwhelming the primary texts. This edition presents both parts of Shakespeare’s Henry IV plays in the authoritative Bevington edition, tracing the full course of Prince Hal’s ambiguous journey from prodigal youth to his role as King Henry V, as well as the controversial career of the tavern “king,” Sir John Falstaff. Contextual materials emphasize the plays’ historical background, Shakespeare’s transformation of his sources, and the intellectual controversies that are embodied in the dramatic action. One Longman Cultural Edition can be packaged at no additional cost with any volume of The Longman Anthology of British Literature by Damrosch et al., or at a discount with any other Longman textbook.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/46/9780321182746.jpg", "title_long": "Henry IV, Part I & II, A Longman Cultural Edition", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.1 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.95680621708 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.95680621708}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.1}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2006-12-27", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Movements & Periods', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ['William Shakespeare', 'Ronald Levao'], 'title": "Henry IV, Part I & II, A Longman Cultural Edition", "isbn13": "9780321182746", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "032118274X", "isbn10": "032118274X"}}
