{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Global", "synopsis": "In 1016, a rebel Lombard lord appealed to a group of pilgrims for help-and unwittingly set in motion "the other Norman Conquest." The Normans in the South is the epic story of the House of Hauteville: of Robert Guiscard, perhaps the most extraordinary European adventurer between Caesar and Napoleon; his brother Roger, who helped him win Sicily from the Saracens; and his nephew Roger II, crowned at Palermo in 1130. The Kingdom in the Sun vividly evokes this "sad, superb, half-forgotten kingdom, cultivated, cosmopolitan, and tolerant,' which lasted a mere 64 years. It concludes with the poignant defeat of the bastard King Tancred in 1194, bringing to a close this extraordinary chapter in Italian history. With a comprehensive listing of all of Sicily\'s surviving Norman monuments, the result is a superb traveler\'s companion and a masterpiece of the historian\'s art.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/21/28/9780140152128.jpg", "title_long": "The Normans in Sicily: The Normans in the South 1016-1130 and the Kingdom in the Sun 1130-1194", "edition": "New Ed", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 2.45 Pounds, Width: 2.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 816, "date_published": "2004-09-01", "subjects": ["History', 'Europe', 'Great Britain'], 'authors": ["John Julius Norwich'], 'title": "The Normans in Sicily: The Normans in the South 1016-1130 and the Kingdom in the Sun 1130-1194", "isbn13": "9780140152128", "msrp": 35, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140152121", "isbn10": "0140152121"}}
