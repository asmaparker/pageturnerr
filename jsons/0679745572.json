But most of all it teaches us about the sacredness of love, “that love is a chain of love, as nature is a chain of life.”<br/><br/>This volume also includes Capote’s A Tree of Night and Other Stories, which the Washington Post called “unobtrusively beautiful...a superlative book.”", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/70/9780679745570.jpg", "title_long": "The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.93 Inches, Length: 5.27 Inches, Weight: 0.63713593718 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.27}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.63713593718}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.93}}, "pages": 216, "date_published": "1993-09-28", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Truman Capote'], 'title": "The Grass Harp: Including A Tree of Night and Other Stories", "isbn13": "9780679745570", "msrp": 9.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0345803078"}, "isbn": "0679745572", "isbn10": "0679745572", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780345803078", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
