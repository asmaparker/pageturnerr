{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster', 'synopsis': "Product Description      Mother Kangaroo expresses her confidence in her youngster's ability to achieve great things.      From School Library Journal      PreSchool-Grade 1-- During a question-and-answer conversation, a little kangaroo brags that he's as tall as a tree, brave enough to face a frill-necked lizard, and able to jump as high as the sun. Mother Kangaroo concludes the questioning by asking if the little kangaroo has a funny face. After playfully reassuring herself that this boastful baby is her own, she expresses confidence that her child will accomplish all these things when he grows up. First published in 1955, this simple story is refreshed by new watercolor paintings. Each double-paged scene includes a framed inset that depicts mother and child in conversation and a larger picture that humorously illustrates the boast. Auclair's semiabstract style, with blended lines and misty tones, complements the dreamy mood of the text. Warm colors and Australian animals provide a rich, slightly exotic atmosphere, making it a natural for toddler storytimes. --Jeanette Larson, Mesquite Public Library, TXCopyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/12/9780027812312.jpg', 'title_long': 'Big Talk', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '1990-10-30', 'subjects': ["Children's Books"], 'authors': ['Miriam Schlein'], 'title': 'Big Talk', 'isbn13': '9780027812312', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0027812316', 'isbn10': '0027812316'}}
