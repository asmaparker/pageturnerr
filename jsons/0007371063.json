{'book': {'publisher': 'Fourth Estate (GB)', 'synopsis': "A wonderful collection of stories from the much-loved Salley Vickers.The stories in this long-awaited collection by Salley Vickers all deal with psychological aspects of love given and withheld, love craved and lost, love met and disappointed; the differing shades of loves between friends, between parents and children, between children and other adults; love even, in one case, for a pet.Psychologically acute, sharply written in lucid and often witty prose, these stories, set in Venice, Greece and Rome as well as London and the English countryside, take us into the complex geography of the human heart. Sometimes joyous and humorous, sometimes melancholy and poignant, this collection confirms Salley Vickers' reputation as one of our most subtle and engaging writers.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/68/9780007371068.jpg', 'title_long': "Aphrodite's Hat", 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.4629707502 Pounds, Width: 0.66929 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.66929}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4629707502}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2011', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Salley Vickers,Sally Vickers'], 'title': "Aphrodite's Hat", 'isbn13': '9780007371068', 'msrp': 18.25, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0007371063', 'isbn10': '0007371063'}}
