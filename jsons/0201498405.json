{"book": {"publisher": "Pearson", "synopsis": "In this second edition of his best-selling book, Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C, Mark Allen Weiss, continues to refine and enhance his innovative approach to algorithms and data structures. Using a C implementation, he highlights conceptual topics, focusing on ADTs and the analysis of algorithms for efficiency as well as performance and running time. Dr. Weiss also distinguishes Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C with the extensive use of figures and examples showing the successive stages of an algorithm, his engaging writing style, and a logical organization of topics.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/00/9780201498400.jpg", "title_long": "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C (2nd Edition)", "edition": "2", "dimensions": "Height: 1.17 Inches, Length: 9.36 Inches, Weight: 1.98636498062 Pounds, Width: 7.48 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.36}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.48}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.98636498062}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.17}}, "pages": 528, "date_published": "1996-09-19", "subjects": ["Computers & Technology', 'Computer Science', 'Systems Analysis & Design', 'Databases & Big Data', 'Programming', 'Algorithms', 'Software Design, Testing & Engineering', 'Software', 'Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Mark A.
