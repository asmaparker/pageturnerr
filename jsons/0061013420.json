The trip down memory lane isn't all bad though, for it reunites Stone with his ex-partner, Dino Bacchetti--now head of detectives in the nineteenth precinct. Trying to find a brilliant killer in a sea of old faces is difficult enough without Stone's former love, Arrington, now Mrs. Vance Calder, resurfacing, too--especially when she sets off her own fireworks coming nose to nose with his latest flame, a Mafia princess as beautiful as she is dangerous.<br/><br/>Caught on thrill ride of a case that tests him as none has ever done before, Stone races to find a twisted madman with a taste for blood vengeance, with only a prayer to find him before Stone's worst fears are realized.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/23/9780061013423.jpg', 'title_long': 'Worst Fears Realized', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2000-04-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Stuart Woods'], 'title': 'Worst Fears Realized', 'isbn13': '9780061013423', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061013420', 'isbn10': '0061013420'}}
