{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper & Row', 'synopsis': "What are your rights if the car you bought is a lemon? If your landlord refuses to return a security deposit? Who gets custody of children after a divorce? How can you successfully sue in small claims court? Or write your own will? The law pervades our lives, yet few of us know just what our rights are, how to use them, and what to do when they're violated. In Everybody's Guide to the Law, celebrated attorney Melvin Belli and accomplished legal writer Allen Wilkinson provide an up-to-date and easy-to-understand practical guide to all the law most people need to know.<br/>Each of the book's twenty chapters, focuses on an important aspect of the law (for example, contracts and torts) or on an aspect of everyday life with significant legal ramifications (for example, real estate and automobiles). Every chapter is designed to be as self-contained as possible so that you are not forced to shuffle between chapters to get a broad picture of the law you want to know about. A thorough index gives quick access to finer points and guides you to relatedsubjects.) And legal terms and concepts are defined not in a glossary at the end of the book but on the spot. Everybody's Guide to the Law advises you when and how you can get by without a lawyer and how to go about getting a lawyer when you need one.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/12/9780060971212.jpg', 'title_long': "Everybody's Guide to the Law: The First Place to Look for the", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.11 Inches, Length: 6.11 Inches, Width: 1.11 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.11}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.11}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.11}}, 'pages': 649, 'date_published': '1987', 'subjects': ['Law', 'Legal Theory & Systems', 'Legal History', 'Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government'], 'authors': ['Melvin Belli', 'Allen P.
