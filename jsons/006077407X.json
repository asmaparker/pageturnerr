Vincent Argeneau may be the hottest guy she"s ever met, living or dead, but she's here to stop a killer from turning this vampire into dust, not to jump into bed with him.<br/>Rule #2: Never kiss a vampire . . . it can be a pain in the neck.<br/>Okay, so Vincent's had four hundred years to perfect his kissing skills, and he does look rather tempting when he runs around the house shirtless. He's also charming, protective . . . did we mention he can kiss?
