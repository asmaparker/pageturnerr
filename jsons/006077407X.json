Vincent Argeneau may be the hottest guy she's ever met, living or dead, but she's here to stop a killer from turning this vampire into dust, not to jump into bed with him.<br/>Rule #2: Never kiss a vampire . . . it can be a pain in the neck.<br/>Okay, so Vincent's had four hundred years to perfect his kissing skills, and he does look rather tempting when he runs around the house shirtless. He's also charming, protective . . . did we mention he can kiss? Jackie needs to be on her guard, or else she'll have to come up with a new rule: If you're going to fall in love with a vampire, make sure it's a bite to remember.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/73/9780060774073.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Bite to Remember (Argeneau Vampires, Book 5)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.42328754304 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.77}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.42328754304}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006-06-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Vampires', 'Gothic', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Romantic', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lynsay Sands'], 'title': 'A Bite to Remember (Argeneau Vampires, Book 5)', 'isbn13': '9780060774073', 'msrp': 20.74, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061739138'}, 'isbn': '006077407X', 'isbn10': '006077407X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061739132', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
