{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Product Description      Tetrahymena thermophila is emerging as a powerful experimental system for functional genetics. The ciliated protozoan offers numerous advantages, not the least of which is the ability to eliminate any specific gene of interest and then to evaluate the effect of that mutation on the living cell. Past investigations with T. thermophila have yielded several key discoveries, including dynein, catalytic RNA, and telomerase. This volume is a comprehensive resource for using Tetrahymena in the laboratory and is aimed at persons already experienced, as well as newcomers to the organism. It covers both the biological background and essential protocols for investigators rapidly turning to Tetrahymena as the experimental system of choice.      About the Author      University of California, Santa Barbara, USADavid Asai received his Ph.D. in biology from the California Institute of Technology in 1980. After postdoctoral research at Caltech and the University of California, Santa Barbara, he served for two years as a Research Biologist at UCSB. In 1985, he moved to Purdue University where he is now Professor of Biological Sciences. His teaching duties include the large introductory cell biology course for undergraduate majors and advanced laboratory courses in cell and molecular biology and fluorescence microscopy.James Forney received a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology at Indiana University. In 1988, after postdoctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the faculty at Purdue University where he is now Professor of Biochemistry. Throughout his career, James Forney has maintained an interest in gene expression and DNA rearrangements in ciliated protozoa. His current teaching responsibilities include general biochemistry and a graduate course in nucleic acid biochemistry.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/43/9780125441643.jpg', 'title_long': 'Tetrahymena Thermophila (Volume 62) (Methods in Cell Biology, Volume 62)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'height: 241 mm, length: 203 mm, width: 32 mm, weight: 1260 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 203}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 32}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 1260}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 241}}, 'pages': 588, 'date_published': '1999-09-14', 'subjects': ['General', 'Developmental Biology', 'Genetics & Genomics', 'Cell Biology', 'Allied Health & Medical -> Medical -> General', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Genetics', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Developmental Biology', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Molecular & Cell Biology'], 'authors': ['Wilson, Leslie'], 'title': 'Tetrahymena Thermophila (Volume 62) (Methods in Cell Biology, Volume 62)', 'isbn13': '9780125441643', 'msrp': 184.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0125441649', 'isbn10': '0125441649', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780080573625', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
