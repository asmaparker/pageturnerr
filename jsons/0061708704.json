Along the way to finding a mail-order bride, falling in love with an alien country and saving Larry\'s life, the duo experience extreme culture shock, flirt with espionage and discover unimaginable qualities in each other. Rose\'s rhythms and comic timing, particularly in dialog with his cousin, will keep readers laughing throughout, even when they\'re crying. While they dance around the morality of their errand, the crux of the travelogue is two old friends learning to reconcile for a life-saving adventure in a foreign world. A satisfying, hysterical page-turner, this will captivate fans of travel writing and family narratives, with special interest for anyone who\'s helped a love one through serious illness." (starred review)<br/>--Publishers Weekly, April 13, 2009 (starred review)<br/><br/>"This book is a side-splitting tour de force that whisks readers off to China on a quest to get a transplant for the author\'s cousin Larry. Second-time memoirist Rose recounts their exploits with an insuperable wit that will appeal to readers who crave unrelenting humor. In a more serious vein, Larry\'s challenging journey to China will resonate with readers who are rightfully concerned about the plight of American patients who may be relegated for years to an organ transplant waiting list."<br/>-- Library Journal, May 1, 2009<br/><br/>Book Description<br/><br/>"This is one of those beautifully written, compulsively readable books that actually feels life-changing. Scene after scene has surprising and sharply memorable characters, and a plot with real-life story twists that are shocking and yet, upon consideration, make perfect sense. By the hauntingly beautiful end, all the scenes added up to a vision of the people of this distant place, and of life itself, that was beyond the joyful adventure of this book. I was left with a vision of life frankly that seemed masterful in scope."<br/><br/>From the Back Cover<br/><br/>The Adventure of a Lifetime (Really): A Madcap Odyssey of the Heart (& a Kidney) on the Far Side of the Earth (Hello, China!?)<br/>Larry Feldman desperately needed a kidney. After two god-awful years on dialysis, watching his life ebb away while waiting on a transplant list behind 74,000 other Americans, the gun-toting couch potato decided to risk everything and travel to China, the controversial kingdom of organ transplants. But Larry urgently needed his cousin Daniel\'s help . . . even though they have been on the outs with each other for years.<br/>Sure, Chinese law forbids transplants to Westerners, but that didn\'t faze Larry. He was confident he could shake out a single pre-loved kidney from the country\'s 1.3 billion people. But wait: Larry was never one to not get his money\'s worth. Since he was already shelling out for a trip to China, he decided to make it a twofer: He arranged to pick up an (e-)mail-order bride while he was at it. After a tireless search on the Internet, he already knew the woman he wanted.<br/>Backed by a quarter-million-dollar disability settlement (was it the icicle falling on his head or the truck rear-ending him?) and armed with an all-purpose letter of recommendation from a devoted nun, Larry ventured forth from his Florida condo on an unlikely search for life and love in the most cryptic country on earth. Conflicted about the ethical issues surrounding medical tourism, and with no time to cultivate even a single Chinese contact, Daniel left the next day, on his own dime.<br/>So begins the quest of two star-crossed cousins to rejuvenate Larry\'s failing body and ever-romantic heart, while avoiding getting tos', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/01/9780061708701.jpg', 'title_long': "Larry's Kidney: Being the True Story of How I Found Myself in China with My Black Sheep Cousin and His Mail-Order Bride, Skirting the Law to Get Him a Transplant--and Save His Life", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2009-05-12', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Asian American & Asian', 'Memoirs'], 'authors': ['Daniel Asa Rose'], 'title': "Larry's Kidney: Being the True Story of How I Found Myself in China with My Black Sheep Cousin and His Mail-Order Bride, Skirting the Law to Get Him a Transplant--and Save His Life", 'isbn13': '9780061708701', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061708704', 'isbn10': '0061708704'}}
