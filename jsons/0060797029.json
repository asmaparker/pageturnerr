{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Cookbooks', 'synopsis': "Freezers are one of the most useful––and most neglected––tools in the kitchen. Particularly great for those dark winter months when you want to get dinner on the table 15 minutes after you get home from work––think lasagna, stews, curries, and soups––freezers are also useful for entertaining friends when time is short. In Can I Freeze It? Susie Theodorou explains the tips, tricks, and rules of freezing food, from containers and wrappers (foil or Tupperware?), to the best methods for retaining moisture and flavor, to what ingredients and dishes can and can't be frozen. She provides a wealth of recipes, along with color photographs, for whole and part dishes. Some are completely pre–assembled (think chicken in a marinade) and then frozen and cooked later. Still others combine frozen ingredients with fresh ones–pair a pastry from the freezer with berries from the farm stand, or defrost a sauce and use it to top fish straight from the market. Can I Freeze It? is the ultimate guide to saving time and money in the kitchen.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/27/9780060797027.jpg', 'title_long': 'Can I Freeze It?: How to Use the Most Versatile Appliance in Your Kitchen', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 1.95 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2007-01-30', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Cooking Methods', 'Entertaining & Holidays'], 'authors': ['Susie Theodorou'], 'title': 'Can I Freeze It?: How to Use the Most Versatile Appliance in Your Kitchen', 'isbn13': '9780060797027', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060797029', 'isbn10': '0060797029'}}
