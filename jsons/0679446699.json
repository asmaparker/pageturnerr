{"book": {"publisher": "Knopf", "synopsis": "Japan"s most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II.<br/><br/>In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife"s missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan"s forgotten campaign in Manchuria.<br/><br/>Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.<br/><br/>From the Trade Paperback edition.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/99/9780679446699.jpg", "title_long": "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle", "edition": "F First American Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 2.25 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.25}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.75}}, "pages": 611, "date_published": "1997-10-21", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Haruki Murakami'], 'title": "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle", "isbn13": "9780679446699", "msrp": 25.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0679446699", "isbn10": "0679446699"}}
