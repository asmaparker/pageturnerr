{"book": {"publisher": "Faber & Faber", "synopsis": "An intimate look at the films of Terry Gilliam, visionary director and animator<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam is a famously candid commentator on his own work, and in these specially recorded interviews, he reflects on how his Midwestern childhood and early career as an animator--including his work as the only American member of Monty Python--prepared him to undertake his extraordinary adventures in cinema.<br/><br/>His films are distinctively dark, fantastic, and strangely hilarious. From the medieval mock-epic Monty Python and the Holy Grail to the mythic, paranoid worlds of The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Gilliam has pursued a totally personal, uncompromising vision. This has led to legendary battles with studios and financiers, notably over The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Brazil, which is now widely considered a classic.<br/><br/>The book includes Gilliam"s storyboards for the films--a unique glimpse at his creative process--along with his original cartoons and black-and-white photographs throughout.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/05/9780571202805.jpg", "title_long": "Gilliam on Gilliam", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.84657508608 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.84657508608}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2000-06-15", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Direction & Production', 'Video'], 'authors": ["Terry Gilliam'], 'title": "Gilliam on Gilliam", "isbn13": "9780571202805", "msrp": 4.07, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0571202802", "isbn10": "0571202802"}}
