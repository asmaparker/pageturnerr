{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize<br/><br/>In what is arguably his greatest book, America"s most heroically ambitious writer follows<br/>the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America"s<br/>prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then<br/>killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on<br/>dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on<br/>keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<br/><br/>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore"s story--and those of the men and women caught up in his<br/>procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a<br/>restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The<br/>Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of<br/>American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/11/9780375700811.jpg", "title_long": "The Executioner"s Song", 'edition": "1st Vintage International ed", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.8 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.8}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 1072, "date_published": "1998-04-28", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology'], 'authors": ["Norman Mailer'], 'title": "The Executioner"s Song", 'isbn13": "9780375700811", "msrp": 18, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375700811", "isbn10": "0375700811"}}
