{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': 'Harry March\'s troubles begin when Lapham, a self-aggrandizing, ostentatious multimillionaire, commences construction of a 36,000-square-foot house (complete with a cutting-edge air-conditioner that cools his entire eight-acre property) directly across the creek from Harry\'s island home in Quogue, in the Hamptons. Harry, an island himself, is something of a wreck and half-nuts, but principled. His wife has left him for an event planner in Beverly Hills; he cuts the polo player out of his shirts; and he speaks mainly with his dog, Hector, a born-again Evangelical and a capitalist who admires Lapham\'s monstrosity as a symbol of American progress. But to Harry, Lapham represents everything that is ruining modern civilization. So he sends daily notes to his nemesis by way of a remote-control toy motorboat, which read: "Mr. Lapham, tear down that house!" When his efforts fail, he turns to politics by other means.]<br/>Lapham Rising follows Harry\'s progress during a single day -- through the strange habits of Hamptons social life; the power of local real estate (embodied in Kathy Polite, who advertises her agency by swimming naked from her boat every morning); the odd workings of his own mind, such as it is; and into his elaborate plot to devise a weapon of individual destruction with which to bring down Lapham and all the Laphams of the world. Of course, it backfires.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/19/9780060833619.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lapham Rising: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 243, 'date_published': '2006-02-07', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Humorous'], 'authors': ['Roger Rosenblatt'], 'title': 'Lapham Rising: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060833619', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060833610', 'isbn10': '0060833610'}}
