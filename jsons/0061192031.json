{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Men not interested in sex? Can this really be true? It is for the estimated 20 million American men and women who are in relationships in which the man has stopped being sexually intimate. This breakthrough book reveals the counterintuitive truth: Many men are just not up for it anymore. To find out why, bestselling author and relationship expert Dr. Bob Berkowitz and his wife, Susan Yager-Berkowitz, began an unprecedented survey of more than 4,000 men and women in this situation, gathering data and following up with hundreds of interviews with selected respondents.<br/>Why don't these men want to have sex? Is the problem physical, emotional, or psychological—or are these guys simply bored with their partners? Is it unexpressed anger about other aspects of their relationships? Are they depressed? Now that there is limitless access to pornography, are some men no longer able to be turned on without it? Are they becoming satiated? Do they have a fully functioning libido, just not for their wives? Or is decreased interest in sex just an unacknowledged but natural fact of life for a lot of men? Do they want their libidos back?<br/>Further, how do their partners feel about this? Are they dejected or relieved? Do they suspect infidelity, asexuality or homosexuality, or just blame themselves? What are they doing about it? What can they do?<br/>He's Just Not Up for It Anymore provides a unique window into the sexless man's mind—so that men and women can understand this important issue and begin to address the problems that have inhibited intimacy, and ultimately solve them.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/36/9780061192036.jpg', 'title_long': "He's Just Not Up for It Anymore: Why Men Stop Having Sex, and What You Can Do About It", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.99648942424 Pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.89}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.99648942424}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2007-12-26', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Marriage', 'Sex', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Sexual Health', 'General', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Human Sexuality'], 'authors': ['Bob Berkowitz', 'Susan Yager-Berkowitz'], 'title': "He's Just Not Up for It Anymore: Why Men Stop Having Sex, and What You Can Do About It", 'isbn13': '9780061192036', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061746738'}, 'isbn': '0061192031', 'isbn10': '0061192031', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061746734', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
