{"book": {"publisher": "Andrews McMeel Publishing", "synopsis": "Calvin and Hobbes are at it again, and this time, our irrepressible friends are taking a walk on the wild side.<br/><br/>Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat chronicles another segment of the multifarious adventures of this wild child and his faithful, but skeptical, friend. If the best cartoons compel readers to identify themselves within the funny frames, then all who enjoy Calvin and Hobbes are creative, imaginative, and ... bad, bad, bad!<br/><br/>Calvin, the irascible little boy with the stuffed tiger who comes to life are a pair bound for trouble. Boring school lessons become occasions for death-defying alien air battles, speeding snow sled descents elicit philosophical discussions on the meaning of life, and Hobbes\"s natural inclination to pounce on his little friend wreaks havoc on Calvin\"s sense of security.<br/><br/>Calvin\"s the kid we all wish we\'d been. Sassy, imaginative, far more verbal than his parents can manage, Calvin is the quintessential bad boyâ€”and the boy we love to see. He terrorizes little Susie, offers 'Candid Opinions' from a neighborhood stand, and questions his parents\' authority. 'What assurance do I have that your parenting isn\'t screwing me up?' he demands.<br/><br/>Calvin and Hobbes manages to say what needs to be said about childhood and life: "Eww, mud," says Calvin. 'Look at this gooshy, dirty, slimy, thick, wet mud ... Bleecch ...
