{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall College Div', 'synopsis': 'B>" From a truly global perspective, this narrative tells the story of human events on the move--the exciting "event history" of wars and politics, booms and busts, the rise and fall of empires, and more--as well as the broader development of human institutions and ideas as they evolve through time. Coverage of both events and broader trends is presented (a) as part of still larger global movements, (b) through the lives of the people who lived it, and (c) as succinctly and vividly as possible. Volume I--"The Great Enterprise: A World History to 1500"--explores ancient civilizations of both the old-world center (3500-200 BCE) and Asia, Africa, and the Americas (2500-200 BCE), as well as classical civilizations (500 BCE-CE 500) and expanding cultural zones around the world (500-1500). For those interested in World History, Comparative History, Humanities and Civilization as well as Multicultural Studies.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/07/9780134309507.jpg', 'title_long': 'Human Venture: The Great Enterprise : A World History to 1500', 'edition': '2nd', 'pages': 348, 'date_published': '1995', 'subjects': ['History'], 'authors': ['anthony-esler'], 'title': 'Human Venture: The Great Enterprise : A World History to 1500', 'isbn13': '9780134309507', 'msrp': 35.31, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0134309502', 'isbn10': '0134309502'}}
