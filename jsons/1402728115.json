An unforgettably original volume, The Book of the Dragon offers a glimpse of a culture we can only imagine.<br/><br/>They lurk in the most hidden corners of the world: the powerful and beautiful creatures known as dragons. We know them as the terrifying beasts of fairy tales, but their own story has remained a mystery--until now. Ciruelo, an illustrator of astounding skill, delves into their secret universe, revealing a rich and fascinating culture filled with poetry, magic, enchantment, and knowledge. Each of these wondrous creatures has its own unique personality and history, and it"s captured dramatically on these spectacular pages. But the revelations go beyond the images, as we gain insight into their psychological characteristics; encounter many different types (Earth Dragons, Water Dragons, Fire Dragons, and the legendary Golden Dragon); learn about their long-held customs; and explore the many legends in which they have figured so prominently--including the heroic tales of Perseus, Hercules, and Tristan.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/12/9781402728112.jpg", "title_long": "The Book of the Dragon", "edition": "5th", "dimensions": "Height: 13.25 Inches, Length: 9.75 Inches, Weight: 0.1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 13.25}}, "pages": 144, "date_published": "2005-08-01", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Sword & Sorcery'], 'authors": ["Ciruelo'], 'title": "The Book of the Dragon", "isbn13": "9781402728112", "msrp": 17.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1402728115", "isbn10": "1402728115"}}
