One day, a good old boy named Llewellyn Moss finds a pickup truck surrounded by a bodyguard of dead men. A load of heroin and two million dollars in cash are still in the back. When Moss takes the money, he sets off a chain reaction of catastrophic violence that not even the law—in the person of aging, disillusioned Sheriff Bell—can contain.<br/><br/>As Moss tries to evade his pursuers—in particular a mysterious mastermind who flips coins for human lives—McCarthy simultaneously strips down the American crime novel and broadens its concerns to encompass themes as ancient as the Bible and as bloodily contemporary as this morning’s headlines.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a triumph.<br/><br/>Look for Cormac McCarthy\"s latest bestselling novels, The Passenger and Stella Maris.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/77/9780375706677.jpg", "title_long": "No Country for Old Men", "edition": "Vintage International Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.73}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.52}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 309, "date_published": "2006-07-11", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Westerns', 'Action & Adventure', 'Men's Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Cormac McCarthy'], 'title": "No Country for Old Men", "isbn13": "9780375706677", "msrp": 12.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307390535"}, "isbn": "0375706674", "isbn10": "0375706674", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307390530", "binding": "print"}]}}
