The five must learn to love the machine and let it rule their lives. But will they let it kill their souls?<br/>"An intensely suspenseful page-turner." --School Library Journal<br/><br/>"A riveting suspense novel with an anti-behaviorist message that works . . . because it emerges only slowly from the chilling events.' --Kirkus Reviews', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/58/03/9780140345803.jpg", "title_long": "House of Stairs", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.13 Inches, Length: 4.38 Inches, Weight: 0.28 Pounds, Width: 0.46 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.38}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.46}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.28}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.13}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "1991-04-01", "subjects": ["Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Boys & Men', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["William Sleator'], 'title": "House of Stairs", "isbn13": "9780140345803", "msrp": 6.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0140345809", "isbn10": "0140345809"}}
