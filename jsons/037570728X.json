That search takes him to the immigrant and literary bohemias of 1950s London, to a facile and unsatisfying career as a writer, and at last to a decaying Portugese colony in East Africa, where he finds a happiness he will then be compelled to betray. Brilliantly orchestrated, at once elegiac and devastating in its portraits of colonial grandeur and pretension, Half a Life represents the pinnacle of Naipaul\'s career.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/85/9780375707285.jpg", "title_long": "Half a Life: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.33 Inches, Weight: 0.4375 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.33}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4375}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2002-10-08", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["V.
