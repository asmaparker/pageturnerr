{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "No one wanted Ai Ling. And deep down she is relieved—despite the dishonor she has brought upon her family—to be unbetrothed and free, not some stranger's subservient bride banished to the inner quarters.<br/>But now, something is after her. Something terrifying—a force she cannot comprehend. And as pieces of the puzzle start to fit together, Ai Ling begins to understand that her journey to the Palace of Fragrant Dreams isn't only a quest to find her beloved father but a venture with stakes larger than she could have imagined.<br/>Bravery, intelligence, the will to fight and fight hard . . . she will need all of these things. Just as she will need the new and mysterious power growing within her. She will also need help.<br/>It is Chen Yong who finds her partly submerged and barely breathing at the edge of a deep lake. There is something of unspeakable evil trying to drag her under. On a quest of his own, Chen Yong offers that help . . . and perhaps more.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/14/9780061730214.jpg', 'title_long': 'Silver Phoenix: Beyond the Kingdom of Xia (Silver Phoenix, 1)', 'edition': 'First edition, first printing (full number line)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.12 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.13}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.12}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2009-04-28', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Girls & Women', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Cindy Pon'], 'title': 'Silver Phoenix: Beyond the Kingdom of Xia (Silver Phoenix, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061730214', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061730211', 'isbn10': '0061730211', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061910647', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
