{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Yo, when I was thirteen, I weighed 255 pounds and already had high blood pressure. My family doctor told me I was "morbidly obese." I had a problem. I liked to eat . . . and eat . . . and eat. But when Mom told me that the whole family was going to be on a reality TV show called Growing Up Gotti, I finally made the decision to change. No way did I want to be seen as the Fatty Gotti by the entire world.<br/>With the support of my mother, my doctor, and my lacrosse team coach, I got to work. I learned all about food, dieting, and exercise, and created a program for myself based on common sense, portion control, and moderation. And the results were great! I lost eighty pounds in the first year! Once the weight started coming off, I started working out, turning fat into muscle and toning up. I also did aerobic exercise and found stamina on the lacrosse field that I never had before. Now friends come to me for advice on starting their own diets and exercise programs.<br/>So listen up -- here, in this book, is all the information you need to get started -- my program of portion control, fat and calorie counters, great-tasting healthy food recipes, and exercise. It\'s the program that turned the Fatty Gotti into the Hottie Gotti.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/26/9780060850326.jpg', 'title_long': 'gotti diet: How I Took Control of My Body, Lost 80 Pounds, and Discovered How to Stay Fit Forever', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2006-06-13', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diets & Weight Loss', 'Other Diets', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Frank Gotti Agnello'], 'title': 'gotti diet: How I Took Control of My Body, Lost 80 Pounds, and Discovered How to Stay Fit Forever', 'isbn13': '9780060850326', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060850329', 'isbn10': '0060850329'}}
