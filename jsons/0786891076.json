{"book": {"publisher": "Hyperion", "synopsis": "One of our country\"s most acclaimed and beloved entertainers, Steve Martin has written a novella that is unexpectedly perceptive about relationships and life. Martin is profoundly wise when it comes to the inner workings of the human heart.<br/>Mirabelle is the "shopgirl" of the title, a young woman, beautiful in a wallflowerish kind of way, who works behind the glove counter at Neiman Marcus 'selling things that nobody buys anymore...'<br/>Slightly lost, slightly off-kilter, very shy, Mirabelle charms because of all that she is not: not glamorous, not aggressive, not self-aggrandizing. Still there is something about her that is irresistible.<br/>Mirabelle captures the attention of Ray Porter, a wealthy businessman almost twice her age. As they tentatively embark on a relationship, they both struggle to decipher the language of love -- with consequences that are both comic and heartbreaking. Filled with the kind of witty, discerning observations that have brought Steve Martin critical success, Shopgirl is a work of disarming tenderness.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/78/9780786891078.jpg", "title_long": "Shopgirl: A Novella", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.5 Inches, Length: 4 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.2}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}}, "pages": 144, "date_published": "2006-09-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Steve Martin'], 'title": "Shopgirl: A Novella", "isbn13": "9780786891078", "msrp": 5.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0786891076", "isbn10": "0786891076"}}
