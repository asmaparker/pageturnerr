{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial Modern Classics", "synopsis": "When The Wapshot Chronicle was published in 1957, John Cheever was already recognized as a writer of superb short stories. But The Wapshot Chronicle, which won the 1958 National Book Award, established him as a major novelist.<br/>Based in part on Cheever’s adolescence in New England, the novel follows the destinies of the impecunious and wildly eccentric Wapshots of St. Botolphs, a quintessential Massachusetts fishing village. Here are the stories of Captain Leander Wapshot, venerable sea dog and would-be suicide; of his licentious older son, Moses; and of Moses’ adoring and errant younger brother, Coverly. Tragic and funny, ribald and splendidly picaresque, The Wapshot Chronicle is a family narrative in the tradition of Trollope, Dickens, and Henry James.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/88/74/9780060528874.jpg", "title_long": "The Wapshot Chronicle (Perennial Classics)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 0.92 Inches, Weight: 0.6393405598 Pounds, Width: 5.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.92}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.6393405598}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2011-06-28", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John Cheever'], 'title": "The Wapshot Chronicle (Perennial Classics)", "isbn13": "9780060528874", "msrp": 14.43, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060528877", "isbn10": "0060528877"}}
