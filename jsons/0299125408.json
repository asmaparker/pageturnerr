The question of how to organize this wealth of material continues to bedevil editors. But there is one text, published under Twain\"s supervision, that can be considered authentic.

More than just a story of a literary career, it reveals his family life and rambunctious boyhood.MARK TWAIN\'S OWN AUTOBIOGRAPHY stands as the last of his great yarns. Here he tells his own story in his own way, freely expressing his joys and sorrows, his affections and hatreds, his rages and revenges.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/00/9780299125400.jpg", "title_long": "Mark Twain"s Own Autobiography: The Chapters from the North American Review (Wisconsin Studies in American Autobiography)", 'dimensions": "Weight: 1.5 Pounds", "dimensions_structured": {"weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.5}}, "pages": 301, "date_published": "1990-10", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Regional U.S.', 'Midwest'], 'authors": ["Mark Twain'], 'title": "Mark Twain"s Own Autobiography: The Chapters from the North American Review (Wisconsin Studies in American Autobiography)", 'isbn13": "9780299125400", "msrp": 89.45, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0299125408", "isbn10": "0299125408"}}
