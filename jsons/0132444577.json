Covin, Samuel and Pauline Glaubinger Professor of Entrepreneurship, Kelley School of Business, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana "Over the years I have observed many seemingly great business opportunities never get off the ground. Quite often, what holds these aspiring entrepreneurs back are common misconceptions about the difficulties and risks of starting a new business. In What\'s Stopping You?, Professors Barringer and Ireland systematically break down the myths that hold many entrepreneurs back from pursuing their dreams." Jeffrey R. Cornwall, The Jack C. Massey Chair in Entrepreneurship, Belmont University, Nashville, Tennessee "Barringer and Ireland simultaneously demystify start-up misconceptions and empower readers to explore their own opportunity with renewed passion.
