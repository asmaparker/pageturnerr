{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Paris in the 1860s: a magnificent time of expression, where brilliant young artists rebel against the stodginess of the past to freely explore new styles of creating—and bold new ways of living.<br/>Passionate, beautiful, and utterly devoted to her art, Berthe Morisot is determined to be recognized as an important painter. But as a woman, she finds herself sometimes overlooked in favor of her male counterparts—Monet, Pissarro, Degas.<br/>And there is one great artist among them who captivates young Berthe like none other: the celebrated genius Édouard Manet. A mesmerizing, breathtaking rogue—a shameless roué, undeterred and irresistible—his life is a wildly overgrown garden of scandal. He becomes Berthe's mentor, her teacher. . . her lover, despite his curiously devoted marriage to his frumpy, unappealing wife, Suzanne, and his many rumored dalliances with his own models. For a headstrong young woman from a respectable family, an affair with such an intoxicating scoundrel can only spell heartbreak and ruin.<br/>But Berthe refuses to resign herself to the life of quiet submission that Society has dictated for her. Undiscouraged, she will create her own destiny. . . and confront life—and love—on her own terms.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/27/9780061579127.jpg', 'title_long': 'With Violets', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.52470018356 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.52470018356}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 307, 'date_published': '2008-10-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Biographical', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Victorian', '20th Century'], 'authors': ['Elizabeth Robards'], 'title': 'With Violets', 'isbn13': '9780061579127', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061980919'}, 'isbn': '0061579122', 'isbn10': '0061579122', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061980916', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
