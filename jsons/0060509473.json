{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Hannah Frost is used to being surrounded by cute, sweet, troublemakers. After all, she\'s the principle of Indiana\'s upper class private elementary school, a popular repository for kids who "don\'t fit in" at public school. But even though she\'s been single since dinosaurs roamed the earth, what is interesting Hannah these days isn\'t her worst student㟩t\'s his father,<br/>What she can put her fingers on? Michael Sawyer, aka Raptor, former FBI computer specialist, has a few good ideas. Trouble is, he\'s too busy trying to save the world––or at least the world\'s internet connections––from certain doom at the hands of an old enemy, and trying to get his imaginative son back on course at school. But there\'s always time for a gorgeous, oh–so–prim, slightly mysterious headmistress, isn\'t there? Michael plans to make time, and do whatever it takes to convince Hannah to do the same.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/77/9780060509477.jpg', 'title_long': 'Just Like A Man', 'edition': 'Regular Print/Single Titl', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 373, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Elizabeth Bevarly'], 'title': 'Just Like A Man', 'isbn13': '9780060509477', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061746045'}, 'isbn': '0060509473', 'isbn10': '0060509473', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061746048', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
