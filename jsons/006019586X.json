{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'After a decade of observing the charmed lives of the rich and famous in her job as coanchor of CNN\'s Showbiz Today, Laurin Sydney has found that many of the special touches that go into celebrities\' magical lifestyles are not beyond the reach of the rest of us. It\'s not about an unlimited pot of gold -- it\'s about attitude.<br/>Why Bother? Why Not! offers simple ways to make everyone in your life feel like a star. It\'s filled to the brim with juicy insider Hollywood stories and offers unique ideas on perfect parties, great gifts, wondrous wraps, fool-proof food, innovative invitations, and world-class travel tips that you can incorporate into your own home.<br/>Throwing a big dinner party? You don\'t have to call a caterer, just call on your creativity -- and if show you don\'t think you have any, Laurin will show , you the way. Want to spice up your Sunday night spaghetti dinner? Do what Frank Sinatra used to do: For an unexpected centerpiece, fill an empty wine bottle with dried pasta; add the recipe for your not-so-secret sauce to the place cards; and give each guest spaghetti tongs as a parting gift.<br/>How much money and effort do you want to spend? It\'s up to you. Laurin has divided her creative ideas into "Baby BOTHERS" and "Big BOTHERS," depending on the time, effort, and cost involved. As she shows us, a little bother can go a long way. For a friend\'s twenty-third birthday, buy twenty-three lottery tickets, twenty-three cigars, twenty-three issues of a favorite magazine -- whatever your pal would want! Even if you can afford a lavish gift, make it a special one. For a twenty-third wedding anniversary, buy a bottle of wine from the same vintage as the year the couple was married. Creativity is what makes your presents stand out, not cash.<br/>Filled with whimsical illustrations and instructional photographs, Why Bother? Why Not! will show you how to turn life into a celebration.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/61/9780060195861.jpg', 'title_long': 'Why Bother?
