{"book": {"publisher": "Northeastern University Press", "synopsis": "Louisa May Alcott championed women"s causes in gothic tales of interracial romance and in newspaper articles published during the Civil War. Drawn from her service as a nurse in a Union hospital as well as from her radical abolitionist activities, these writings allow Alcott to comment boldly on unstable racial identities, interracial sex and marriage, armed slave rebellion, war, and the links between the bondage of slaves and the conditions of white womanhood. A comprehensive introduction situates Alcott and her family within the network of antebellum reformers and unmasks her personal and literary struggles with the boundaries of race, sex, and class.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/76/9781555533076.jpg", "title_long": "Louisa May Alcott On Race, Sex, And Slavery", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 160, "date_published": "1997-04-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Women's Studies'], 'authors": ["Louisa May Alcott'], 'title": "Louisa May Alcott On Race, Sex, And Slavery", "isbn13": "9781555533076", "msrp": 19.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1555533078", "isbn10": "1555533078"}}
