{'book': {'publisher': 'Ebury Press', 'synopsis': 'In a warm, personal memoir about life at 10 Downing Street, Sarah Brown shares her experiences as the wife of the British Prime Minister Today, Gordon’s words are simple and heartfelt. He promises, as his own school motto said, "to do his utmost." I know that the same will go for me, too. We turn to the door, greeting the policeman on duty. It is time to play our part in contributing to what happens next in government and a new life behind the black door.<br/><br/>Intimate, reflective, surprising, and funny, this book takes readers backstage to reveal what it’s like to be an ordinary woman, wife, and mother in extraordinary circumstances. Sarah gave up a successful business career to serve her country and champion countless charities around the world, and found herself living a life that included attending Nelson Mandela’s birthday party, giving speeches in front of Barbra Streisand, growing vegetables with Michelle Obama, and discussing Darfur with George Clooney. For readers who have ever wondered what it’s like to travel with national security forces, pack for a photo op with supermodels, or pause a speech in front of hundreds when the teleprompter fails, it’s all here—from what to do when the school play clashes with a visit to the White House to what it feels like to support the man you love as he makes tough decisions to stave off global financial meltdown.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/77/9780091940577.jpg', 'title_long': 'Behind the Black Door', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.68433168168 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.68433168168}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 464, 'date_published': '2011-06-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'Presidents & Heads of State', 'Memoirs'], 'authors': ['Sarah Brown'], 'title': 'Behind the Black Door', 'isbn13': '9780091940577', 'msrp': 32.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0091940575', 'isbn10': '0091940575'}}
