{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "What if you had sculpted the perfect replica of a gorgeous Greek god and, right before you're about to unveil it to a group of ladies, it comes to life in all its naked glory? What if your creation wanted to reward you by fulfilling your every desire? What would you do?<br/>If you're Alexandra, you'd want to smash something.<br/>The statue of Darius, playboy god, was supposed to bring in much-needed cash for the orphanage where Alex grew up. Now that it has miraculously turned to flesh, she just needs to give it a small imperfection so that it'll turn back into the marble statue she created.<br/>Never mind that she fell in love with him—it—a little every day while she was sculpting the exquisite body. Never mind that he—it—is every bit as sexy and charming and powerful as she imagined.<br/>And she sure as heck shouldn't be tempted by his heated offer to fulfill her every desire . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/75/9780060549275.jpg', 'title_long': "A Greek God at the Ladies' Club", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-11-25', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Paranormal'], 'authors': ['Jenna McKnight'], 'title': "A Greek God at the Ladies' Club", 'isbn13': '9780060549275', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006174476X'}, 'isbn': '0060549270', 'isbn10': '0060549270', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061744761', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
