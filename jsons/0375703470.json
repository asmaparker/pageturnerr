With her keen eye, penchant for paradox, and yearning for truth, Dillard asks: Why do we exist? Where did we come from? How can one person matter? Dillard searches for answers in a powerful array of images: pictures of bird-headed dwarfs in the standard reference of human birth defects; ten thousand terra-cotta figures fashioned for a Chinese emperor in place of the human court that might have followed him into death; the paleontologist and theologian Teilhard de Chardin crossing the Gobi Desert; the dizzying variety of clouds. Vivid, eloquent, haunting, For the Time Being evokes no less than the terrifying grandeur of all that remains tantalizingly and troublingly beyond our understanding.<br/><br/>'Beautifully written and delightfully strange...as earthy as it is sublime...in the truest sense, an eye-opener.' —Daily News<br/><br/>'Stimulating, humbling, original. [Dillard] illuminate[s] the human perspective of the world, past, present and future, and the individual\'s relatively inconsequential but ever so unique place in it.' —Rocky Mountain News', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/78/9780375703478.jpg", "title_long": "For the Time Being", "edition": "Vintage Books Ed", "dimensions": "Height: 8.02 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.14}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.52}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.02}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2000-02-08", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Science & Math', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Nature Writing & Essays', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors": ["Annie Dillard'], 'title": "For the Time Being", "isbn13": "9780375703478", "msrp": 13.36, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307477665"}, "isbn": "0375703470", "isbn10": "0375703470", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307477668", "binding": "print"}]}}
