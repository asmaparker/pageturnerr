In attempting to hitchhike round Ireland wich a fridge, Tony Hawks did both, and his foolhardiness led him to one of the best experiences of his life. Joined by his trusty traveling companion-cum-domestic appliance, he made his way from Dublin to Donegal, from Sligo through Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Cork, Wexford, Wicklow--and back again to Dublin. In their month of madness, Tony and his fridge met a real prince, a bogus king, and the fridge got christened. They surfed together, entered a bachelor festival, and one of them had sex without the other knowing. And unexpectedly, the fridge itself became a momentary focus for the people of Ireland.<br/><br/>An international bestseller, Round Ireland with a Fridge is a classic travel adventure in the tradition of Bill Bryson with a dash of Dave Barry.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/24/9780312274924.jpg", "title_long": "Round Ireland with a Fridge", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.1999836 Inches, Length: 5.55 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.55}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.1999836}}, "pages": 264, "date_published": "2001-03-07", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Travel', 'Europe', 'Ireland', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors": ["Tony Hawks'], 'title": "Round Ireland with a Fridge", "isbn13": "9780312274924", "msrp": 17.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312274920", "isbn10": "0312274920"}}
