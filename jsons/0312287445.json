{"book": {"publisher": "St. Martin"s Griffin", "synopsis": "When Stacy Horn--single, deeply addicted to television, and hopelessly attached to two diabetic cats--turned forty, she free-falled into a mid-life crisis. Waiting for My Cats to Die is a passionately and profoundly honest look at what happens the moment you realize--beyond a shadow of a doubt--that some day the credits will roll on your life. There are all those things you haven"t done yet. There are all those things you have and wish you hadn"t. In the battle against time, a frontal attack is the best strategy. Horn explores abandoned cemeteries and descends into crypts. She researches long-lost relatives, interviews the elderly, and learns all she can about the ghost haunting her apartment. No sign indicating the downward pull of things goes unnoticed. And yet life, with so much to celebrate, is irresistible. Here is a wonderful, quirky, refreshing memoir of hilarity and heartache: life at the mid-point of life.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/43/9780312287443.jpg", "title_long": "Waiting for My Cats to Die: A Memoir", "dimensions": "Height: 8.34 Inches, Length: 5.38 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.98 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.38}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.98}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.34}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2002-01-17", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs'], 'authors": ["Stacy Horn'], 'title": "Waiting for My Cats to Die: A Memoir", "isbn13": "9780312287443", "msrp": 13.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312287445", "isbn10": "0312287445"}}
