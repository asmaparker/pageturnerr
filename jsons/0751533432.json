{"book": {"publisher": "Sphere", "synopsis": "Edwardian England is a country at the peak of its power; a kingdom of peace, prosperity and progress. As Jessie and Violet enjoy their coming-out in the glittering Season of 1908, their thoughts are of pleasure, dancing and falling in love.<br/><br/>For the Morlands things seem set fair: new business ventures expand their influence and wealth; there are weddings, babies in the nursery, careers for the boys now reaching manhood. It is an exciting age, with new technologies - motor cars, telephones, radio, aeroplanes - extending man"s control over the natural world.<br/><br/>But under the appearance of permanence, a different reality is stirring. Socialism, the suffrage movement, the constitutional crisis, all call forth ever more dissent and anger. Increasingly violent protests and strikes disturb the peace; war with Germany looms ever closer. With the King"s death, it begins to seem that the safe Edwardian world was only a dream, from which the wakening will be hard indeed.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/39/9780751533439.jpg", "title_long": "Morland Dynasty 26: The Dream Kingdom", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.8377565956 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8377565956}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 640, "date_published": "2004-11-04", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Cynthia Harrod-Eagles'], 'title": "Morland Dynasty 26: The Dream Kingdom", "isbn13": "9780751533439", "msrp": 12.95, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0748133135"}, "isbn": "0751533432", "isbn10": "0751533432", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780748133130", "binding": "print"}]}}
