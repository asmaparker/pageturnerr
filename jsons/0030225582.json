{'book': {'publisher': 'Brooks Cole', 'synopsis': "This fresh approach to teaching introductory biology to non-science majors is based on two sets of beliefs. First, that nonscience majors absorb biology best when it is presented in the context of personal experience or human relevance. Second, that today's variety of media--video, CD-ROMs, and the Internet--offer unprecedented opportunities to bring people, imagery, biological processes, hands-on interactivity, and up-to-the-minute data into the study of biology. Authors John Postlethwait and Janet Hopson have created a topical, case-history approach to teaching life science fundamentals that fully integrates electronic media so that the student can explore relevant biology in ways suited to his or her own learning style. An engaging, student-relevant case study opens and is interwoven throughout each chapter. Additional examples, anecdotes, research stories, and applications are also used to give students a well-rounded framework for learning core biological concepts. The book's innovative design allows integration of references to the other EXPLORE LIFE components within it. The media are integrated into the course line by line, not just attractively packaged and offered as ancillaries. This complete integration can be seen in every chapter. This multimedia, applications-driven approach in EXPLORE LIFE has the potential to reshape the teaching of non-majors biology. Instructors can adopt this approach with a high level of flexibility, using as much or as little of the media as they deem appropriate, incorporating their own material, and adapting EXPLORE LIFE to their individual needs.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/81/9780030225581.jpg', 'title_long': 'Explore Life (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 10 Inches, Weight: 3.60235336108 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.60235336108}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 720, 'date_published': '2002-07-01', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['John H.
