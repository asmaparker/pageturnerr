{'book': {'publisher': 'Arrow', 'synopsis': "While in Islamabad investigating the possibilities of setting up an adventure travel company, Jonny Bealby met the woman of his dreams. Not only that, but Rachel was the person with whom he could live out his dream -- to travel the Old Silk Road on horseback. On his return to Pakistan that Christmas, however, Jonny was faced with those dreadful words: 'I've met somebody else...' With his heart fixed on this journey and the possibility of a TV deal, Jonny set out to find a Quixotic stranger as his companion. In no time he found Sarah -- attractive, warm and funny -- the perfect candidate for a possible romance. Unfortunately, though, during their search for the Heavenly Horses that would carry them across the Mountains of Heaven, their fledgling friendship was beset by problems of communication, inexperience and the difficulty of adapting to radically different cultures and surroundings. A breathtaking travelogue, and an intriguing and heart-warming illustration of human relationships as they are tested to their limits.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/98/9780099414698.jpg', 'title_long': "'SILK DREAMS, TROUBLED ROAD'", 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.49383546688 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7874}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49383546688}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Travel', 'Asia', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'General', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors': ['Johnny Bealby'], 'title': "'SILK DREAMS, TROUBLED ROAD'", 'isbn13': '9780099414698', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099414694', 'isbn10': '0099414694'}}
