Through these moving reflections, we see one life laid bare--joys, sorrows, regrets, and all. And through the eyes of a woman nearing the end of her days, we come to understand what life experience has taught her: that no matter what the stakes, we must look within ourselves and gather the courage to follow our hearts.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/76/9780385316576.jpg", "title_long": "Follow Your Heart", "edition": "English Language", "dimensions": "Height: 7.04 Inches, Length: 5.04 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.04}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.45}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.04}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "1996-08-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Family Life', 'Epistolary', 'Women's Fiction', 'Domestic Life', 'Friendship', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Susanna Tamaro'], 'title": "Follow Your Heart", "isbn13": "9780385316576", "msrp": 17, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0385316577", "isbn10": "0385316577"}}
