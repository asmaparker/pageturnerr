What common thread binds these three nations together? Answer: each is famous for producing unique, distinctive, delicious bread. But what about Japan, home to rice and delicacies of the sea? Is there not a doughy, gastronomic delight they can claim as their own? The answer is no...until now! Kazuma Azuma, a 16-year-old-boy blessed with otherworldly baking powers, has taken it upon himself to create Ja-pan, the national bread of the land of the rising sun!<br/><br/>After a brief sojourn in Izu, Kazuma returns with the special ingredient he dreams will win him the Pantasia Rookie Tournament. The challenge this time is a dubious one indeed: to bake a loaf of bread that won\"t mold for three entire weeks.
