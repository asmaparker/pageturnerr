{"book": {"publisher": "Transworld Hardbacks", "synopsis": "Johnny Truant, a wild and troubled sometime employee in a LA tattoo parlour, finds a notebook kept by Zampano, a reclusive old man found dead in a cluttered apartment. Herein is the heavily annotated story of the Navidson Report. Will Navidson, a photojournalist, and his family move into a new house. What happens next is recorded on videotapes and in interviews. Now the Navidsons are household names. Zampano, writing on loose sheets, stained napkins, crammed notebooks, has compiled what must be the definitive work on the events on Ash Tree Lane. But Johnny Truant has never heard of the Navidson Record. Nor has anyone else he knows. And the more he reads about Will Navidson\"s house, the more frightened he becomes. Paranoia besets him. The worst part is that he can\"t just dismiss the notebook as the ramblings of a crazy old man. He\"s starting to notice things changing around him...Immensely imaginative, impossible to put down and impossible to forget, 'House of Leaves' is thrilling, terrifying and unlike anything you have ever read before.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/02/9780385603102.jpg", "title_long": "House of Leaves", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25195 Inches, Length: 7.16534 Inches, Weight: 2.8329400667 Pounds, Width: 1.5748 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.16534}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5748}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.8329400667}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25195}}, "pages": 736, "date_published": "2000", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Literary'], 'authors": ['Mark Z Danielewski'], 'title": "House of Leaves", "isbn13": "9780385603102", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "038560310X", "isbn10": "038560310X"}}
