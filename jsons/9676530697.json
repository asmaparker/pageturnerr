{'book': {'publisher': 'Oxford University Press', 'synopsis': 'Flowing through the heart of Thailand, the teeming waters of the Chao Phya River system yield much insight into the history and culture of the Thai people. The Chao Phya, with its four tributaries, has fostered a prosperous economy and stable political climate. More than any other river system in Asia, it has served as the source of life for a flourishing agricultural sector and served as a vital highway, while protecting Thai cities from enemy assault. Today, while more vital than ever, the river has been changing in ways detrimental to its future. This eye-opening, beautifully illustrated work offers a fascinating look at this famous lifeline of modern-day Thailand.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/91/9789676530691.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Chao Phya : River in Transition', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 2.25 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 244, 'date_published': '1995-10-19', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Earth Sciences', 'Geography', 'Travel', 'Asia', 'General', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Steve Van Beek'], 'title': 'The Chao Phya : River in Transition', 'isbn13': '9789676530691', 'msrp': 70, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '9676530697', 'isbn10': '9676530697'}}
