Which is why, with best buddy Shelley Nowack in tow, Jane's booking down to a nearby mystery writers' convention to mingle with the agents, publishing bigwigs, and famous authors ... and to maybe drum up interest in her own recently completed manuscript.<br/>But what would a mystery convention be without a mystery? So when a famous ego-squashing editor is undone by an anonymous poisoner, and a much hated book-bashing journalist is himself bashed quite nastily in the parking lot, Jane and Shelley jump right on the case, ready to snoop, eavesdrop, and gossip their way to a solution. But the would-be killer they seek is no open book. And trying to read him/her/them may turn out to be harder -- and deadlier -- than anyone initially imagined.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/08/9780060099008.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bell, Book, and Scandal (Jane Jeffry Mysteries)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.27 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.64}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.27}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2004-10-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', "Women's Adventure", 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jill Churchill'], 'title': 'Bell, Book, and Scandal (Jane Jeffry Mysteries)', 'isbn13': '9780060099008', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060099003', 'isbn10': '0060099003'}}
