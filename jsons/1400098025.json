He is an art professor, a mountain climber, and a mercenary, performing assassinations (i.e., sanctions) for money to augment his black-market art collection. Now Hemlock is being tricked into a hazardous assignment that involves an attempt to scale one of the most treacherous mountain peaks in the Swiss Alps, the Eiger.<br/><br/>In a breathtakingly suspenseful story that is part thriller and part satire, the author traces Hemlock’s spine-tingling adventures, introducing a cast of intriguing characters—villains, traitors, beautiful women—into the highly charged atmosphere of danger. The accumulating threads of suspicion, accusation, and evidence gradually knit themselves into a bizarre and death-defying climax in this exciting, entertaining novel that will keep readers on the edge of their seats until the last absorbing page.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/26/9781400098026.jpg", "title_long": "The Eiger Sanction: A Novel", "edition": "~", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2005-05-10", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Romance', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Trevanian'], 'title": "The Eiger Sanction: A Novel", "isbn13": "9781400098026", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "030723844X"}, "isbn": "1400098025", "isbn10": "1400098025", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307238443", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
