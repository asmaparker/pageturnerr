{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": 'A volume of plays from the founding architect of twentieth-century drama, including his most popular and controversial work<br/><br/>A Penguin Classic<br/><br/>Pirandello is brilliantly innovatory in his forms and themes, and in the combined energy, imagination and visual colours of his theatre. This volume of plays, translated from the Italian by Mark Musa, opens with Six Characters in Search of an Author, in which six characters invade the stage and demand to be included in the play. The tragedy Henry IV dramatizes the lucid madness of a man who may be King. In So It Is (If You Think So), the townspeople exercise a morbid curiosity attempting to discover “the truth” about the Ponza family. Each of these plays can lay claim to being Pirandello’s masterpiece, and in exploring the nature of human personality, each one stretches the resources of drama to their limits.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
