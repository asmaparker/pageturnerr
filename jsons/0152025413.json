{"book": {"publisher": "Harcourt", "synopsis": "Meet the Moffats. There is Sylvie, the oldest, the cleverest, and-most days at least-the responsible one; Joey, who though only twelve is the man of the house...sometimes; Janey, who has a terrific upside-down way of looking at the world; and Rufus, who may be the littlest but always gets in the biggest trouble.<br/>Even the most ordinary Moffat day is packed with extraordinary fun. Only a Moffat could get locked in a bread box all afternoon, or dance with a dog in front of the whole town, or hitch a ride on a boxcar during kindergarten recess. And only a Moffat could turn mistakes and mischief into hilarious one-of-a-kind adventure.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/10/9780152025410.jpg", "title_long": "The Moffats", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.62 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.56}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.62}}, "pages": 210, "date_published": "2001-04-01", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Eleanor Estes'], 'title": "The Moffats", "isbn13": "9780152025410", "msrp": 7.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0152025413", "isbn10": "0152025413", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780547592077", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
