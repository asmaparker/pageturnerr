{'book': {'publisher': 'The Chinese University of Hong Kong Press', 'synopsis': 'A towering figure in the literary history of twentieth-century China, Lu Xun has exerted immense and continuous influence through his short stories, which remain today as powerful as they were first written. While echoes of these stories can still be heard in the fictional works from both sides of the Taiwan Strait in the eighties and nineties, The True Story of Ah Q has long become an intrinsic part of the Chinese vocabulary.<br/>Like many Chinese intellectuals searching for a solution to China\'s problems, Lu Xun went to Japan to study medicine, a choice he later abandoned for a career in writing, which he considered to be a far more effective weapon to save China. A prolific author of pungent and "dagger-like" essays, Lu Xun is also a tireless translator of Western critical and literary works. His fictional works have been translated into more than twenty languages.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/45/9789629960445.jpg', 'title_long': 'The True Story of Ah Q (Bilingual Series on Modern Chinese Literature)', 'edition': 'Bilingual', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.6 Inches, Length: 6.52 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.36 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.52}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.36}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044933474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.6}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2003-01-21', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies'], 'authors': ['Xun Lu'], 'title': 'The True Story of Ah Q (Bilingual Series on Modern Chinese Literature)', 'isbn13': '9789629960445', 'msrp': 8, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9629960443', 'isbn10': '9629960443'}}
