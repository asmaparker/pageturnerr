{"book": {"publisher": "Simon Pulse", "synopsis": ""IT\"S STILL TRUE."<br/>That\'s the first thing James Tillerman says to his sister Dicey every morning. It\'s still true that their mother has abandoned the four Tillerman children somewhere in the middle of Connecticut. It\'s still true they have to find their way, somehow, to Great-aunt Cilla\'s house in Bridgeport, which may be their only hope of staying together as a family.<br/>But when they get to Bridgeport, they learn that Great-aunt Cilla has died, and the home they find with her daughter, Eunice, isn\'t the permanent haven they\'ve been searching for. So their journey continues to its unexpected conclusion -- and some surprising discoveries about their history, and their future.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/22/9780689851322.jpg", "title_long": "Homecoming (The Tillerman Series #1)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.1875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 402, "date_published": "2002-08-01", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors": ["Cynthia Voigt'], 'title": "Homecoming (The Tillerman Series #1)", "isbn13": "9780689851322", "msrp": 8.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1439132070"}, "isbn": "0689851324", "isbn10": "0689851324", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781439132074", "binding": "print"}]}}
