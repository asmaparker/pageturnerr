Then letters from Mac begin to arrive, casual and distant at first, but gradually becoming more personal and revealing.<br/>In his absence, Wyn finds she not only learns more about Mac but also about herself, as she becomes Tyler\'s mentor, passing on the wisdom and healing power of bread making. Her new self-awareness and resiliency will be tested when the Queen Street Bakery\'s existence is threatened, as well as when Mac returns and she must decide whether there is still a place for him in her life.<br/>From critically acclaimed author Judith Ryan Hendricks comes the next chapter of the Queen Street Bakery, where questions are answered and old friends are revisited.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/71/9780060726171.jpg', 'title_long': "The Baker's Apprentice", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.5 Pounds, Width: 1.21 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.21}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-04-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'New Adult & College'], 'authors': ['Judith R Hendricks'], 'title': "The Baker's Apprentice", 'isbn13': '9780060726171', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060726172', 'isbn10': '0060726172'}}
