{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'A prominent physician debuts as a gifted storyteller in Lie Still, a dazzlingly suspenseful and compulsively readable trip through the dark underbelly of the OR -- where reputations, careers, and lives are on the line.<br/>In a sleepy, small-town Arizona hospital, a thirteen-year-old boy lies in a coma after inexplicably suffering a cardiac arrest. His doctors are perplexed. Although emotionally disturbed Henry Rojelio was a frequent visitor to the emergency room -- often for bouts of asthma, but usually just for attention -- no one ever anticipated a battle with death.<br/>Surgical resident Malcolm Ishmail began his medical career months before at a busy Phoenix hospital -- a far cry from the small ER deep in the silent heart of the desert, where Henry Rojelio lies. There, Malcolm fell into a secret, exhausting affair with one of his professors, Dr. Mimi Lyle, a beautiful, charismatic brain surgeon who had subtle difficulties in the operating room. In a moment of weakness "Dreamy Mimi" confessed to him her failings as a neurosurgeon; Malcolm reported her to his superiors . . . and promptly lost his job.<br/>Now, miles away from Phoenix, Dr. Ishmail struggles to save his young asthmatic patient\'s life and his future as a surgeon. And with little time and few clues to the cause of Henry Rojelio\'s sudden collapse, the impressionable doctor wonders whether his former lover may have exacted a disturbing revenge.Rich in medical detail and written with stylish, razor-sharp action and dialogue, Lie Still is a gripping, emotional drama of human failings and devastating consequences that marks the debut of a remarkable new voice.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/47/9780060505547.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lie Still: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-10-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Medical', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors': ['David Farris'], 'title': 'Lie Still: A Novel of Suspense', 'isbn13': '9780060505547', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060505540', 'isbn10': '0060505540'}}
