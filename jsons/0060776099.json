        ] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. Brave New World, his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature. Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, Brave New World likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites.<br/>"Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English." —Chicago Tribune<br/>This book also includes the full text of Brave New World Revisited, Huxley\'s 1958 nonfiction followup to Brave New World.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/60/91/9780060776091.jpg", "title_long": "Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 0.93 Inches, Length: 8.04 Inches, Weight: 0.64 Pounds, Width: 5.46 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.04}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.46}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.64}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.93}}, "pages": 340, "date_published": "2005-07-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'British & Irish', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopian', 'Cyberpunk', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Aldous Huxley'], 'title": "Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited", "isbn13": "9780060776091", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060776099", "isbn10": "0060776099"}}
