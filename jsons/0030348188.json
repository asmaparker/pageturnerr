{'book': {'publisher': 'Brooks/Cole Pub Co', 'synopsis': 'The main objectives of this introductory physics book are to provide the student with a clear and logical presentation of the basic concepts and principles of physics, and to strengthen an understanding of the concepts and principles through a broad range of interesting applications to the real world. In order to meet these objectives, emphasis is placed on sound physical arguments and discussions of everyday experiences and observations. At the same time, we motivate the student through practical examples that demonstrate the role of physics in other disciplines. The sixth edition features new pedagogy in keeping with the findings in physics education research. The rich new pedagogy has been integrated within the framework of an established and reliable text, facilitating its use by instructors.The full COLLEGE PHYSICS text, which covers the standard topics in classical physics and 20th century physics, is divided into six parts. COLLEGE PHYSICS, VOLUME 2 covers three of those six parts, including electricity and magnetism (Part IV); properties of light and the field of geometric and wave optics (Part V); and an introduction to special relativity, quantum physics, and atomic and nuclear physics (Part VI).', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/81/9780030348181.jpg', 'title_long': 'College Physics, Vol. 2 (Student Solution Manual And Study Guide)', 'edition': '6', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.55 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.5}}, 'pages': 287, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Physics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Raymond A.
