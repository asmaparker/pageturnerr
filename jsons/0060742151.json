{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': "From Bernd Heinrich, the bestselling author of Winter World, comes the remarkable story of his father's life, his family's past, and how the forces of history and nature have shaped his own life. Although Bernd Heinrich's father, Gerd, a devoted naturalist, specialized in wasps, Bernd tried to distance himself from his “old-fashioned” father, becoming a hybrid: a modern, experimental biologist with a naturalist's sensibilities.<br/>In this remarkable memoir, the award-winning author shares the ways in which his relationship with his father, combined with his unique childhood, molded him into the scientist, and man, he is today. From Gerd's days as a soldier in Europe to the family's daring escape from the Red Army in 1945 to the rustic Maine farm they came to call home, Heinrich relates it all in his trademark style, making science accessible and awe-inspiring.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/57/9780060742157.jpg', 'title_long': "The Snoring Bird: My Family's Journey Through a Century of Biology", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1.94 Pounds, Width: 1.62 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.62}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.94}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 480, 'date_published': '2007-05-15', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Scientists', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Plants', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Field Guides', 'Birds'], 'authors': ['Bernd Heinrich'], 'title': "The Snoring Bird: My Family's Journey Through a Century of Biology", 'isbn13': '9780060742157', 'msrp': 29.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060742151', 'isbn10': '0060742151'}}
