{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Biochemical Actions of Hormones, Volume XIII is a 13-chapter text that explores the biochemical aspects of polypeptide, steroid, and insect hormones.<br/>The opening chapters examine the control of glucose transport by insulin, the participation of nuclear poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribosyl)ation in hormonal mechanisms, and the concept of ovulation control. These topics are followed by discussions on the immunohistochemistry of human chorionic gonadotropin; the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) action on adrenal cholesterol metabolism and its interaction with adrenal receptors; the structure-activity relationships of neurohypophyseal hormones; and the interactions between different functional sites in the epidermal growth factor receptor. A chapter focuses on the juvenile hormone-binding proteins. The remaining chapters consider the actions of steroid hormones. These chapters specifically describe the androgen receptor, the interaction of the glucocorticoid receptors with specific DNA sequences, and glucocorticoid actions on fibroblasts. A discussion on the potential role of RNA in the glucocorticoid receptor mechanism is also included in these chapters.<br/>This book will be of great benefit to endocrinologists, biochemists, biologists, and researchers who are interested in hormonal action and regulation.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/30/9780124528130.jpg', 'title_long': 'Biochemical Actions of Hormones, Volume 13;', 'edition': 1, 'dimensions': 'Page Fidelity', 'pages': 438, 'date_published': '1986', 'subjects': ['Endocrinology & Metabolism', 'Chemical & Biochemical', 'Allied Health & Medical -> Medical -> Endocrinology & Metabolism', 'Professional, Career & Trade -> Engineering -> Chemical Engineering'], 'authors': ['Gerald, Editor Litwack'], 'title': 'Biochemical Actions of Hormones, Volume 13;', 'isbn13': '9780124528130', 'msrp': 72.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0124528139', 'isbn10': '0124528139', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780323150330', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
