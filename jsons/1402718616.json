{"book": {"publisher": "Sterling", "synopsis": "A new edition of the revolutionary bestseller, with four million copies in print. Allen Carr’s innovative Easyway method—which he discovered after his own 100-cigarette-a-day habit nearly drove him to despair—has helped millions kick smoking without feeling anxious and deprived. That’s because he helps smokers discover the psychological reasons behind their dependency, explains in detail how to handle the withdrawal symptoms, shows them how to avoid situations when temptation might become too strong, and enables them to stay smoke-free. Carr discusses such issues as nicotine addiction; the social “brainwashing” that encourages smoking; the false belief that a cigarette relieves stress; the role boredom plays in sabotaging efforts to stop; and the main reasons for failure. With this proven program, smokers will be throwing away their packs for good.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/18/9781402718618.jpg", "title_long": "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking Join the Millions Who Have Become Nonsmokers Using the Easyway Method", "edition": "17th printing", "dimensions": "Weight: 1.04 Pounds", "dimensions_structured": {'weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.04}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Subjects'], 'authors": ["Allen Carr'], 'title": "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking Join the Millions Who Have Become Nonsmokers Using the Easyway Method", "isbn13": "9781402718618", "msrp": 3.05, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1402718616", "isbn10": "1402718616"}}
