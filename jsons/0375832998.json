Until he blows it. The school bookie says the odds are 12-to-1 against him getting Noah back, but Paul’s not giving up without playing his love really loud. His best friend Joni might be drifting away, his other best friend Tony might be dealing with ultra-religious parents, and his ex-boyfriend Kyle might not be going away anytime soon, but sometimes everything needs to fall apart before it can really fit together right.<br/><br/>This is a happy-meaningful romantic comedy about finding love, losing love, and doing what it takes to get love back in a crazy-wonderful world.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/94/9780375832994.jpg", "title_long": "Boy Meets Boy", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.0007495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.46 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.46}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.0007495716908}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2005-05-10", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Social Issues', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'LGBTQ+'], 'authors": ["David Levithan'], 'title": "Boy Meets Boy", "isbn13": "9780375832994", "msrp": 8.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307482448"}, "isbn": "0375832998", "isbn10": "0375832998", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307482440", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
