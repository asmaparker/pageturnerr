{"book": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "synopsis": "The Masterpiece is the tragic story of Claude Lantier, an ambitious and talented young artist who has come from the provinces to conquer Paris but is conquered instead by the flaws of his own genius. Set in the 1860s and 1870s, it is the most autobiographical of the twenty novels in Zola"s Rougon-Macquart series. It provides a unique insight into Zola"s career as a writer and his relationship with Cezanne, a friend since their schooldays in Aix-en-Provence. It also presents a well-documented account of the turbulent Bohemian world in which the Impressionists came to prominence despite the conservatism of the Academy and the ridicule of the general public.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/33/9780192839633.jpg", "title_long": "The Masterpiece (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'edition": "New Ed", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 464, "date_published": "1999-07-22", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Émile Zola', 'Roger Pearson'], 'title": "The Masterpiece (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'isbn13": "9780192839633", "msrp": 12.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0192839632", "isbn10": "0192839632"}}
