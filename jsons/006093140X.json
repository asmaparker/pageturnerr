In one, with a black cover, she reviews the African experience of her earlier years. In a red one she records her political life, her disillusionment with communism. In a yellow one she writes a novel in which the heroine relives part of her own experience. And in a blue one she keeps a personal diary. Finally, in love with an American writer and threatened with insanity, Anna resolves to bring the threads of all four books together in a golden notebook.<br/>Lessing\'s best-known and most influential novel, The Golden Notebook retains its extraordinary power and relevance decades after its initial publication.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/07/9780060931407.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Golden Notebook: Perennial Classics edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.7 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 5.2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.7}}, 'pages': 672, 'date_published': '1999-02-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Doris Lessing'], 'title': 'The Golden Notebook: Perennial Classics edition', 'isbn13': '9780060931407', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '006093140X', 'isbn10': '006093140X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062295002', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
