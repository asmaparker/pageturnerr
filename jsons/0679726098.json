{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "Strong Opinions offers Nabokov\"s trenchant, witty, and always engaging views on everything from the Russian Revolution to the correct pronunciation of Lolita. â€¢ "First published in 1973, this collection of interviews and essays offers an intriguing insight into one of the most brilliant authors of the 20th century." - The Guardian<br/><br/>Nabokov ranges over his life, art, education, politics, literature, movies, among other subjects. Keen to dismiss those who fail to understand his work and happy to butcher those sacred cows of the literary canon he dislikes, Nabokov is much too entertaining to be infuriating, and these interviews, letters and articles are as engaging, challenging and caustic as anything he ever wrote.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/98/9780679726098.jpg", "title_long": "Strong Opinions", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.67461452172 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.79}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.67461452172}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "1990-03-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Vladimir Nabokov'], 'title": "Strong Opinions", "isbn13": "9780679726098", "msrp": 13.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307788075"}, "isbn": "0679726098", "isbn10": "0679726098", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307788078", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
