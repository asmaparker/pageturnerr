With characteristic wit, lucidity, and insight, Pinker argues that the dogma that the mind has no innate traits-a doctrine held by many intellectuals during the past century-denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces objective analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of politics, violence, parenting, and the arts. Injecting calm and rationality into debates that are notorious for ax-grinding and mud-slinging, Pinker shows the importance of an honest acknowledgment of human nature based on science and common sense.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/33/43/9780142003343.jpg", "title_long": "The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 1.16 Inches, Length: 9.3 Inches, Weight: 1.27 Pounds, Width: 6.06 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.3}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.06}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.27}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.16}}, "pages": 560, "date_published": "2003-08-26", "subjects": ["Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Personality', 'Evolutionary Psychology', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Evolution', 'History & Philosophy', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience & Neuropsychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology'], 'authors": ["Steven Pinker'], 'title": "The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature", "isbn13": "9780142003343", "msrp": 20, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101200324", "ePub": "1101200324"}, "isbn": "0142003344", "isbn10": "0142003344", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101200322", "binding": "print"}]}}
