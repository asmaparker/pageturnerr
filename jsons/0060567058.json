{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': '"I, Lilly Rose Cleary, have a nearly endless capacity for driving myself crazy." And who knows a woman better than herself? Especially a woman like Lilly, a tough-as-nails partner working in a Sarasota, Florida, law firm representing fat-cat physicians in malpractice cases. Lilly is also an obsessive-compulsive health nut who has a bad habit of tripping over dead bodies.<br/>After successfully representing a client in a kayak whiplash case, she becomes a victim herself when she\'s ambushed at her office door. The following day a client turns up dead from an apparent poisoning. As if that isn\'t enough to tax Lilly\'s chronic state of anxiety, her sometime boyfriend -- an attorney in search of the perfect class-action suit -- moves in and promptly begins to drive Lilly nuts.<br/>Amid the chaos, Lilly tries to figure out why she\'s in this mess. Who would want to attack a tofu-eating attorney? And why? Joined by a colorful cast of characters, including a bridge-diving rottweiler and a lay minister who runs a U-pick opium poppy farm, Lilly has a mostunorthodox -- and hilarious -- way of finding out.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/57/9780060567057.jpg', 'title_long': 'Skinny-dipping: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.04 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2004-10-12', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths'], 'authors': ['Claire Matturro'], 'title': 'Skinny-dipping: A Novel of Suspense', 'isbn13': '9780060567057', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060567058', 'isbn10': '0060567058', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062133588', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
