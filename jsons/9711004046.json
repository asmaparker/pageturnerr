Andres Bonifacio authored that historic successful uprising of an entire colony against the might of Spain. And in the process he set into motion the emancipation of a people who had been colonized and abused for over three hundred years. Bonifacio's lowly origin stood in sharp contrast with the nobility of his aspirations and the magnitude of the task he had willfully and courageously assumed Coming from an undistinguished lineage, Bonifacio proved much bigger than all the limitations imposed by the circumstances of his birth.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/40/9789711004040.jpg', 'title_long': "Bonifacio's Unfinished Revolution", 'pages': 70, 'date_published': '1990-05-01', 'authors': ['Alejo L.
