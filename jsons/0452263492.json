Nel Wright grows up to become a wife and mother, happy to remain in her hometown of Medallion, Ohio. Sula Peace leaves Medallion to experience college, men, and life in the big city, an exceptional choice for a black woman to make in the late 1920s. As girls, Nel and Sula are the best of friends, only children who find in each other a kindred spirit to share in each girl\"s loneliness and imagination. When they meet again as adults, it\"s clear that Nel has chosen a life of acceptance and accommodation, while Sula must fight to defend her seemingly unconventional choices and beliefs. But regardless of the physical and emotional distance that threatens this extraordinary friendship, the bond between the women remains unbreakable: "Her old friend had come home.... Sula, whose past she had lived through and with whom the present was a constant sharing of perceptions. Talking to Sula had always been a conversation with herself.' Lyrical and gripping, Sula is an honest look at the power of friendship amid a backdrop of family, love, race, and the human condition. --Gisele Toueg', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/99/9780452263499.jpg", "title_long": "Sula (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)", "edition": "Edition Unstated", "dimensions": "Height: 7.99211 Inches, Length: 5.15747 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 0.47244 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15747}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.47244}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.99211}}, "pages": 174, "date_published": "1989", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'War', 'Action & Adventure', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Toni Morrison'], 'title": "Sula (Contemporary Fiction, Plume)", "isbn13": "9780452263499", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0452263492", "isbn10": "0452263492", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307388131", "binding": "print"}]}}
