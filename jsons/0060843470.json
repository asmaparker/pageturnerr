{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Scott Templeton lives for the adrenaline rush, but when the ghost of a legendary race car driver suddenly appears in the passenger seat next to him, it sends Scott literally into a tailspin. Now he can't convince the guy to head toward the light and stop haunting him, not until Scott promises to make a special delivery.<br/>Maggie Cooper has a five-year plan that involves making executive VP with a corner office and a salary that will cause a grown man to weep. What it doesn't involve is a high-speed hotshot who claims her dead father sent him. She doesn't care how charming Scott is, or how he seems to devour her with his eyes, or even how her shotgun-toting grandmother is playing matchmaker. Maggie is determined to resist, but Scott is just as determined to convince her that loving him is worth the risk.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/72/9780060843472.jpg', 'title_long': 'Love in the Fast Lane', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.3968320716 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3968320716}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006-12-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Paranormal'], 'authors': ['Jenna McKnight'], 'title': 'Love in the Fast Lane', 'isbn13': '9780060843472', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061747033'}, 'isbn': '0060843470', 'isbn10': '0060843470', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061747038', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
