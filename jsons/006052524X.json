{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin', 'synopsis': 'Newly appointed Detective Inspector Gemma James has never thought to question her friend Hazel Cavendish about her past. So it is quite a shock when Gemma learns that their holiday retreat to a hotel in the Scottish Highlands is, in fact, Hazel\'s homecoming -- and that fellow guest Donald Brodie was once Hazel\'s lover, despite a vicious, long-standing feud between their rival, fine whiskey distilling families. And the fires of a fierce and passionate affair may not have burned out completely -- on Brodie\'s part at least, since he\'s prepared to destroy Hazel\'s marriage to win back his "Juliet." But when a sudden, brutal murder unleashes a slew of sinister secrets and long-seething hatreds, putting Hazel\'s life in peril, Gemma knows she will need help unraveling this very bloody knot -- and calls for the one man she trusts more than any other, Duncan Kincaid, to join her far from home ... and in harm\'s way.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/48/9780060525248.jpg', 'title_long': 'Killer in the Rain', 'edition': 'n.e.', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.43431065614 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.43431065614}}, 'pages': 430, 'date_published': '1966-07', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Hard-Boiled'], 'authors': ['Raymond Chandler'], 'title': 'Killer in the Rain', 'isbn13': '9780060525248', 'msrp': 2.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '006183002X', 'ePub': '006183002X'}, 'isbn': '006052524X', 'isbn10': '006052524X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061830020', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
