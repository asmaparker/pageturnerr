{"book": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "synopsis": "Pride and Prejudice has delighted generations of readers with its unforgettable cast of characters, carefully choreographed plot, and a hugely entertaining view of the world and its absurdities. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighborhood, the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and upside down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love.<br/><br/>In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight. This new edition includes a new introduction, updated notes, and new appendices on social rank and dancing in 19th-century England.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/85/9780192802385.jpg", "title_long": "Pride and Prejudice (Oxford World"s Classics)", "edition": "New", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.56}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 382, "date_published": "2004-04-29", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Regency'], 'authors": ["Jane Austen'], 'title": "Pride and Prejudice (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'isbn13": "9780192802385", "msrp": 7.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0192802380", "isbn10": "0192802380"}}
