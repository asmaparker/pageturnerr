{"book": {"publisher": "St. Martin"s Griffin", "synopsis": "Consulted by millions, the I Ching is one of the oldest and most widely used divination systems ever devised. Since ancient times it has provided its readers with insight into their own lives and guidance for the future. All too often, however, the available translations have blurred the basic message of the I Ching"s hexagrams and obscured their relevance.<br/><br/>Utilizing the knowledge gained from many years of using the I Ching in her practice, psychotherapist Sarah Dening provides, with this translation, a valuable resource not only for help with life"s extraordinary passages but something that should be consulted daily as one would a trusted friend. Dening details how to use and read the I Ching's hexagrams and gives insight on how to relate the ancient wisdom of the I Ching's hexagrams to the trials and tribulations of everyday modern life. The Everyday I Ching fills the long-standing need for a clear, focused rendering of the I Ching-one which makes its timeless wisdom accessible to everyone.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/25/9780312151225.jpg", "title_long": "The Everyday I Ching", "edition": "REV", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.54895103238 Pounds, Width: 0.51 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.51}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.54895103238}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "1997-01-15", "subjects": ["Religion & Spirituality', 'Other Eastern Religions & Sacred Texts', 'I Ching', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Eastern'], 'authors": ["Sarah Dening'], 'title": "The Everyday I Ching", "isbn13": "9780312151225", "msrp": 19.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312151225", "isbn10": "0312151225", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781466833913", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
