With Voyagers of the Titanic, Richard Davenport-Hines gives us a magnificent history of the people intimately connected with the infamous ship—from deal-makers and industry giants, like J.P. Morgan, who built and operated it; to Molly Brown, John Jacob Astor IV, and other glittering aristocrats who occupied its first class cabins; to the men and women traveling below decks hoping to find a better life in America. Commemorating the centennial anniversary of the great disaster, Voyagers of the Titanic offers a fascinating, uniquely original view of one of the most momentous catastrophes of the 20th century.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/53/9780062107053.jpg', 'title_long': 'Voyagers of the Titanic: Passengers, Sailors, Shipbuilders, Aristocrats, and the Worlds They Came From', 'edition': 'Large type / Large print', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 1.2 Inches, Weight: 1.14 Pounds, Width: 6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.14}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2012-03-06', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Australia & Oceania', 'Oceania', 'Europe', 'Great Britain', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'World', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Transportation', 'Ships'], 'authors': ['Richard Davenport-Hines'], 'title': 'Voyagers of the Titanic: Passengers, Sailors, Shipbuilders, Aristocrats, and the Worlds They Came From', 'isbn13': '9780062107053', 'msrp': 26.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0062107054', 'isbn10': '0062107054'}}
