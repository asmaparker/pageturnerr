Through the eyes of Margarita, the eldest daughter, the lives, loves and tragedies of the Montez O'Briens and their complex family relationships unfold. While reflecting on the life of Emilio, her doggedly masculine brother, Margarita also ruminates on the nature of femininity, family, sex, love and earthly happiness. Her musings recall exhilarating adventures, eliciting tears and laughter, and tenderly reveal the bounteous heart of a warm, passionate family. At once lush, erotic and gorgeously written, The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien is a masterwork by one of America's greatest writers.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/59/44/9780060975944.jpg", "title_long": "Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O"Brien, The", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 496, "date_published": "2003-12-23", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Oscar Hijuelos'], 'title": "Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O"Brien, The", 'isbn13": "9780060975944", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060975946", "isbn10": "0060975946"}}
