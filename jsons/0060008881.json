{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "The Once–A–Week Slow Motion Fitness Revolution.<br/>Power of 10 seems to contradict nearly everything we're accustomed to hearing about exercise. Forget hours on the treadmill, and forget daily visits to the gym. This new program offers 20–minute workout sessions once or twice per week, with an alluring emphasis on rest and recovery on your days off. The principle behind Power of 10 is simple: by lifting weights in slow motion, making each rep last 20 seconds (10 seconds lifting and 10 seconds lowering) instead of the typical 7 seconds, you can maximise muscle transformation. The short workouts are so effective that your body will need days to recover and repair properly. Studies have shown that such routines can increase lean body mass, help burn calories, and prevent cardiovascular disease more efficiently than aerobic exercise alone. Fitness expert Adam Zickerman will present the science behind the growing movement, and back up his theories with recent results from such reputable sources as the American Heart Association.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/88/9780060008888.jpg', 'title_long': 'Power of 10: The Once-a-Week, Slow Motion Fitness Revolution', 'edition': '11/24/02', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 1.5 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2002-12-24', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Exercise & Fitness'], 'authors': ['Adam Zickerman', 'Bill Schley'], 'title': 'Power of 10: The Once-a-Week, Slow Motion Fitness Revolution', 'isbn13': '9780060008888', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060008881', 'isbn10': '0060008881'}}
