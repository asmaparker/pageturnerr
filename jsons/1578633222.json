Then add a lot more melancholy and a lot more spooky.<br/>What Is Goth? dispels the false stereotypes and reinforces the true ones surrounding Goths and Goth culture. "To the mundane," Voltaire writes, "Goths are weird, black-clad freaks who are obsessed with death; they are sad all of the time. Take a closer look at the Goth scene, however, and you will find a rich tapestry of ideas and practices and a menagerie of colorful characters. Oh, dear. I said \x91colorful.\x92'<br/>This illustrated answer to What Is Goth? shows readers how to:<br/>\x95 Identify the anatomies of different kinds of Goths: CyberGoths, Rivet-Heads, Romantigoths, Goth-a-billies, and more<br/>\x95 Write a poem (Mad Libs style) with the Gothic Poem Generator<br/>\x95 Properly dance the dances of darkness: "Cobwebs in the Attic," 'The Gothic Tai Chi Dance,' 'Pulling the Evil Taffy'<br/>Yes, Goths are pale, wear black clothing, love black makeup (on men and women), mope, listen to real downer music, and perfect the art of living in a perpetual state of ennui and melancholy.
