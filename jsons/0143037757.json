Mr. Judt writes with enormous authority.” —The Wall Street Journal<br/><br/>“Magisterial . . . It is, without a doubt, the most comprehensive, authoritative, and yes, readable postwar history.” —The Boston Globe<br/><br/>Almost a decade in the making, this much-anticipated grand history of postwar Europe from one of the world"s most esteemed historians and intellectuals is a singular achievement. Postwar is the first modern history that covers all of Europe, both east and west, drawing on research in six languages to sweep readers through thirty-four nations and sixty years of political and cultural change-all in one integrated, enthralling narrative. Both intellectually ambitious and compelling to read, thrilling in its scope and delightful in its small details, Postwar is a rare joy.<br/><br/>Judt"s book, Ill Fares the Land, republished in 2021 featuring a new preface by bestselling author of Between the World and Me and The Water Dancer, Ta-Nehisi Coates.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/50/9780143037750.jpg", "title_long": "Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 9.06 inches, Length: 1.62 inches, Weight: 2.12 Pounds, Width: 6.03 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.62}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.03}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.12}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.06}}, "pages": 960, "date_published": "2006-09-05", "subjects": ["History', 'Europe', 'France', 'Germany', 'Military', 'World War II', 'World', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics'], 'authors": ["Tony Judt'], 'title": "Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945", "isbn13": "9780143037750", "msrp": 17.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1440624763"}, "isbn": "0143037757", "isbn10": "0143037757", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781440624766", "binding": "print"}]}}
