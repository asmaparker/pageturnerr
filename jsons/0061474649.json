{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Penelope Porter longed for a baby. But now that her marriage is over, she's turned to the next best thingâ€”a cute, cuddly puppy. Mr. Darcy's an absolute sweetheart, but he could use a stint in obedience school. He keeps sneaking over to the shop across the street, the one owned by Baltimore bad boy Dylan Mersey. Not that Penelope minds having to fetch her dog from his handsome new friend . . .<br/>Mr. Darcy? Only a high-society hottie would name a mischievous pooch after a romantic hero. No, to Dylan this pup's name is Bonsai . . . and his owner's impossible to resist. Dylan's more rough-and-tumble than refined, but he's about to prove he's exactly what Penelope needs to forget her heartless ex.<br/>Soon things are heating up between proper Penelope and dangerous Dylan as they learn that misbehaving isn't just fun for the dog. What Penelope considers unsuitable quickly becomes unstoppable, and she discovers that true love truly is worth the risk.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/44/9780061474644.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bedtime for Bonsai', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2008-11-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'New Adult & College', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['Elaine Fox'], 'title': 'Bedtime for Bonsai', 'isbn13': '9780061474644', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061980064'}, 'isbn': '0061474649', 'isbn10': '0061474649', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061980060', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
