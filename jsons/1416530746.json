Recently jilted by her fianc√© for an Italian heiress -- an insult delivered via a sleazy tabloid -- Diana was now very publicly unengaged, and surrounded by humiliating rumors. So why was billionaire Cole Harrison closing in on her with two crystal flutes and a bottle of champagne?<br/>The former stableboy had received an ultimatum from his uncle: bring home a wife -- soon -- or lose his share of a booming multinational business. Coolly analytical and arrestingly attractive, Cole knew what he wanted in a bride, and Diana Foster -- rich, beautiful, principled -- fit the role perfectly. But while a long, slow kiss sealed the bargain that solved both their dilemmas, neither imagined the extraordinary journey that would begin on that unforgettable night. . . .', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/49/9781416530749.jpg", "title_long": "Remember When", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2006-04-25", "subjects": ["Romance'], 'authors": ["Judith McNaught'], 'title": "Remember When", "isbn13": "9781416530749", "msrp": 4.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "1416530746", "isbn10": "1416530746"}}
