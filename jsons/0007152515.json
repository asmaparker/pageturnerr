{'book': {'publisher': 'Fourth Estate', 'synopsis': "The best selling author of FERMAT'S LAST THEOREM and THE CODE BOOK tells the story of the brilliant minds that deciphered the mysteries of the Big Bang. Albert Einstein once said: 'The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.' Simon Singh believes geniuses like Einstein are not the only people able to grasp the physics that govern the universe. We all can. As well as explaining what the Big Bang theory actually is, the book will address why cosmologists believe that it is an accurate description of the origin of the universe. It will also tell the story of the scientists who fought against the establishment idea of an eternal and unchanging universe. Simon Singh, renowned for making difficult ideas much less difficult than they first seem, is the perfect guide for this journey. Everybody has heard of the Big Bang Theory. But how many of us can actually claim to understand it? With characteristic clarity and a narrative peppered with anecdotes and personal histories of those who have struggled to understand creation, Simon Singh has written the story of the most important theory ever.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/13/9780007152513.jpg', 'title_long': 'Big Bang', 'edition': '1st US Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.85629224604 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.85629224604}}, 'pages': 544, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Astronomy & Space Science', 'Astronomy'], 'authors': ['Simon Singh'], 'title': 'Big Bang', 'isbn13': '9780007152513', 'msrp': 41.35, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0007152515', 'isbn10': '0007152515'}}
