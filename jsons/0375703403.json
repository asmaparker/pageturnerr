He approaches the city from unexpected angles, taking us into the criminal underworld of rival Muslim and Hindu gangs, following the life of a bar dancer raised amid poverty and abuse, opening the door into the inner sanctums of Bollywood, and delving into the stories of the countless villagers who come in search of a better life and end up living on the sidewalks.<br/><br/>As each individual story unfolds, Mehta also recounts his own efforts to make a home in Bombay after more than twenty years abroad. Candid, impassioned, funny, and heartrending, Maximum City is a revelation of an ancient and ever-changing world.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/09/9780375703409.jpg", "title_long": "Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found", "edition": "60568th", "dimensions": "Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.18 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.18}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.93}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.9}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.96}}, "pages": 560, "date_published": "2005-09-27", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'History', 'Asia', 'India', 'World', 'Civilization & Culture', 'Women in History', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing', 'Pictorial', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology'], 'authors": ["Suketu Mehta'], 'title": "Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found", "isbn13": "9780375703409", "msrp": 15.98, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307574318"}, "isbn": "0375703403", "isbn10": "0375703403", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307574312", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
