{"book": {"publisher": "Random House Worlds", "synopsis": "The “brilliantly realized” (The New York Times Book Review) breakthrough novel from visionary author Neal Stephenson, a modern classic that predicted the metaverse and inspired generations of Silicon Valley innovators<br/><br/>Hiro lives in a Los Angeles where franchises line the freeway as far as the eye can see. The only relief from the sea of logos is within the autonomous city-states, where law-abiding citizens don’t dare leave their mansions.<br/><br/>Hiro delivers pizza to the mansions for a living, defending his pies from marauders when necessary with a matched set of samurai swords. His home is a shared 20 X 30 U-Stor-It. He spends most of his time goggled in to the Metaverse, where his avatar is legendary.<br/><br/>But in the club known as The Black Sun, his fellow hackers are being felled by a weird new drug called Snow Crash that reduces them to nothing more than a jittering cloud of bad digital karma (and IRL, a vegetative state).<br/><br/>Investigating the Infocalypse leads Hiro all the way back to the beginning of language itself, with roots in an ancient Sumerian priesthood. He’ll be joined by Y.T., a fearless teenaged skateboard courier. Together, they must race to stop a shadowy virtual villain hell-bent on world domination.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/58/9780553380958.jpg", "title_long": "Snow Crash", "dimensions": "Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.46 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.32 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.46}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.32}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.2}}, "pages": 440, "date_published": "2000", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Computers & Internet', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Humorous'], 'authors": ["Neal Stephenson'], 'title": "Snow Crash", "isbn13": "9780553380958", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0553898191"}, "isbn": "0553380958", "isbn10": "0553380958", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780553898194", "binding": "print"}]}}
