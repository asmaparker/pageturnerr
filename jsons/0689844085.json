For more than two decades, he faces the wrath of nature and the struggle to stay alive with little more than his wits to save him. Then, following an encounter with cannibals, a tribesman named Friday becomes Crusoe’s only ally. As their relationship develops, the line between servant and friend begins to blur, and the possibility of freedom for them both at last looms on the horizon.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/89/9780689844089.jpg", "title_long": "Robinson Crusoe", "dimensions": "Height: 7.625 Inches, Length: 5.125 inches, Weight: 0.70988848364 Pounds, Width: 1.2 inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.70988848364}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.625}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2001-07-01", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors": ["Daniel Defoe'], 'title": "Robinson Crusoe", "isbn13": "9780689844089", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1442457813"}, "isbn": "0689844085", "isbn10": "0689844085", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781442457812", "binding": "print"}]}}
