Sonoko Kakiuchi, an Osaka lady of a good family, married to a dully respected lawyer, tells a story of temptation and betrayal. Sonoko is infatuated with the beautiful art student and femme fatale Mitsuko, a woman so seductive and heartless she can even turn Sonoko"s husband into her own accomplice. Filled with intrigue and treacherous romance, readers will be entranced by Tanizaki’s seminal novel.<br/><br/>At once savagely funny and timorously exact in its portrayal of sexual enthrallment, Quicksand is “beautifully and mysteriously contrived.”—Newsday", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/21/9780679760221.jpg", "title_long": "Quicksand", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.61 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.54}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.61}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.9}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "1995-06-24", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'LGBTQ+ Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mysteries & Thrillers', 'Thrillers', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Historical', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Junichiro Tanizaki'], 'title": "Quicksand", "isbn13": "9780679760221", "msrp": 15, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0679760229", "isbn10": "0679760229"}}
