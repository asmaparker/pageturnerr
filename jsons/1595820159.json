{"book": {"publisher": "Dark Horse", "synopsis": "In 1979, science fiction and horror were brought together in director Ridley Scott"s classic film Alien. The film follows the crew of a space cargo-ship, the Nostromo, who land on a hostile planet in response to a faint SOS only to discover an abandoned ship with a ravenous alien on board. Alien inspired three movie sequels, and now Aliens: Original Sin expands further on this classic story, bringing back characters like Ripley 8, the clone of Lt. Ellen Ripley, and android Call. It also sorts out unanswered questions from the movies and raises entirely new ones. Was it just coincidence that the Nostromo happened to pass by the desolate planet? Why was the alien on the crashed ship in the first place? The answers, along with intense action, chilling horror and even deeper questions await in suspense virtuoso Michael Jan Friedman"s Aliens: Original Sin.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/50/9781595820150.jpg", "title_long": "Aliens: Original Sin", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.17 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.17}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.65}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.25}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 300, "date_published": "2005-12-06", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Science Fiction', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Michael Jan Friedman'], 'title": "Aliens: Original Sin", "isbn13": "9781595820150", "msrp": 6.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1595820159", "isbn10": "1595820159"}}
