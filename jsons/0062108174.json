{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'A powerful and truly haunting debut novel from Bianca Zander with a spine-tingling hint of the gothic and supernatural, The Girl Below enthralls with a strange magic akin to the works of Audrey Niffenegger, Haruki Murakami, and Sarah Waters. Zander’s novel is a story of parents and children; of love, regret, and second chances. When a young English woman, recently returned to London after a ten-year absence, finds herself slipping back into her childhood, she must solve the mysteries of her dysfunctional family—and unearths disturbing secrets that could shatter everything she believes about who she is and her place in the world.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/73/9780062108173.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Girl Below: A Novel', 'edition': 2, 'dimensions': 'ePub', 'pages': 324, 'date_published': '2012', 'subjects': ['Literary', 'Coming of Age', 'Visionary & Metaphysical', 'American', 'Historical', 'Gothic', 'Contemporary Women', 'English & College Success -> English -> Fiction'], 'authors': ['Bianca Zander'], 'title': 'The Girl Below: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780062108173', 'msrp': 11.99, 'binding': 'Kindle Edition', 'related': {'Paperback': '0062108166'}, 'isbn': '0062108174', 'isbn10': '0062108174', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062108166', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
