{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Lee Emery is an empty nester, contentedly married to a man she has known forever and hunkering down in the house where she grew up. She believes she is happy occupying such a familiar emotional and physical space. But questions of the path not taken start to haunt her after she publishes a memoir of her deliciously eccentric grandmother with whom she traipsed through Europe at eighteen. It was then that Lee fell in love for the first time. Twenty-five years later, "what if" obsessions shake up her settled life. Should she have made a different choice—Simon—instead of the man now next to her? Struck once more by the lingering power of first love, she sets off a chain of events that catapults her back to Europe and to a second chance that she may or may not want to risk.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/58/9780061335358.jpg', 'title_long': 'The End of an Error', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 1.1 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 5.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.9}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2008-04-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'World Literature', 'Asian', 'Romance', 'New Adult & College'], 'authors': ['Mameve Medwed'], 'title': 'The End of an Error', 'isbn13': '9780061335358', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061969990'}, 'isbn': '0061335355', 'isbn10': '0061335355', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061969997', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
