But when an accident separates Abby and Tam, it feels as though all the stars have fallen out of the sky and nothing will ever be right again. As the days between them turn to weeks, then months, dangers and changes fill up Abby\'s and Tam\'s lives. Will they ever find their way home to each other?<br/>Daddy says, "Most folks got a north star in their life—something that gives their life extra meaning.
