{"book": {"publisher": "Wentworth Press", "synopsis": "Distinguished by its precision, its graceful use of language, and its resonant depth, the innovative style of Nobel Prize-winning author Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) radically altered literary conventions and influenced generations of writers. In The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Old Man and the Sea, and numerous short stories, he explored such universal themes as stoicism in adversity, as well as our futile struggles against nature and mortality.This evocative, sympathetic biography illuminates the events that informed Hemingway"s vigorous life: an accident-prone youth and early rivalry with his father; his experiences in World War I, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II; his stormy relationships with writers and women; his sudden fame, slow decline, and suicide. Based on previously unavailable information and exclusive interviews, Hemingway enriches anyone"s understanding and appreciation of America"s most important twentieth-century writer.', 'language": "fr", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/06/9780306808906.jpg", "title_long": "Cours D"art Et De Science Militaire: Tactique Comparée Et Appliquée, Ou Traité Analytique Sur La Formation, L"emploi Et La Conduite Des Troupes De ...
