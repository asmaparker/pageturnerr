{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon Red', 'synopsis': "She knew she was playing with fire . . . and was eager to burn.<br/>The very thought of an innocent young woman—a teacher at a fusty finishing school—modeling for a series of titillating photographs to be sold at London's bookstalls is scandalous. But orphaned Emily Clemens's destitute circumstances have left her little choice. It is all part of her plan to capture the attention of some well-heeled roué who will then make her his pampered mistress. So the untouched beauty sheds her outer garments—and her inhibitions—to strike provocative poses before the lens of handsome photographer Eric Twyford.<br/>But each seductive attitude she assumes is stoking a fire within that Emily never knew existed—and the heat is spurring her on to ever-greater heights of sensuous abandon. Still, the devilishly desirable Eric, a consummate professional, remains unmoved by her erotic display. If Emily cannot arouse a man in the flesh, what hope does she have as a black-and-white postcard?<br/>She has already gone far beyond the boundaries of propriety. Now Emily's brazenly determined to go even farther—to seduce Eric, letting him take her to intoxicating places she has never been. But once she has reached ecstasy, will she ever be able to leave?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/27/9780061431227.jpg', 'title_long': 'Mistress', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.61}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2008-03-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Erotica', 'Historical', 'Romantic', 'Victorian', 'Romance', 'Medieval', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Leda Swann'], 'title': 'Mistress', 'isbn13': '9780061431227', 'msrp': 12.72, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061737100'}, 'isbn': '0061431222', 'isbn10': '0061431222', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061737107', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
