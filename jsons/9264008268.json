{'book': {'publisher': 'Organization for Economic', 'synopsis': '<p>The joint IEA/NEA study provides generation cost estimates for over a hundred power plants that use a variety of fuels and technologies. These include coal-fired, gas-fired, nuclear, hydro, solar and wind plants. Cost estimates are also given for combined heat and power plants that use coal, gas and combustible renewables. Data and information for this study were provided by experts from 19 OECD member countries and 3 non-member countries. The power plants examined in the study use technologies available today. The study shows that the competitiveness of alternative generation sources and technologies ultimately depends on many parameters: there is no clear-cut "winner". Major issues related to generation costs addressed in the report include: descriptions of state-of-the-art generation technologies; the methodologies for incorporating risk in cost assessments; the impact of carbon emission trading; and how to integrate wind power into the electricity grid.</p>', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/67/9789264008267.jpg', 'title_long': 'Projected Costs of Generating Electricity: 2005 Update', 'edition': '2nd Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 1.10231131 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.10231131}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 232, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Education & Reference', 'Reference', 'Encyclopedias & Subject Guides', 'Business', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Projected Costs of Generating Electricity: 2005 Update', 'isbn13': '9789264008267', 'msrp': 91, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9264008268', 'isbn10': '9264008268'}}
