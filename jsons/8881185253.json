{'book': {'publisher': 'Skira', 'synopsis': "Santiago Calatrava. With more than ten years having passed since the 'case' of Calatrava was introduced into the international debate, it remains as relevant as ever to ask the same questions posed back then regarding an artistic personality and oeuvre still capable of provoking such heated and contradictory reactions from critics, the general public, and contemporary architectural culture alike. The extremism of the positions assumed by those faced with Calatrava's work compels us inevitably to investigate a phenomenon that intersects with the redefinition of the relationship between art and technology, or more specifically, between architecture and engineering, not to mention the crisis of the professions and their social credibility.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/52/9788881185252.jpg', 'title_long': 'Santiago Calatrava', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6.04 Inches, Weight: 1.2786811196 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.04}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.73}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2786811196}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1999-10-15', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Architecture', 'Individual Architects & Firms', 'Criticism', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Reference'], 'authors': ['Luca Molinari'], 'title': 'Santiago Calatrava', 'isbn13': '9788881185252', 'msrp': 25, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '8881185253', 'isbn10': '8881185253'}}
