{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': 'This volume is aimed at students of all branches of engineering on introductory courses in engineering and electrical engineering, as well as courses in computer methods, numerical methods, and computer and mathematical methods. It introduces general problem-solving and design techniques through a five-step process using MATLAB engineering software, for analysis and graphical display. Each chapter is organized around a specific application, drawn from a variety of engineering disciplines, that illustrates a particular MATLAB capability. The text, divided into three parts, aims to provide both fundamental and advanced tools and techniques to solve engineering problems.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/07/9780132804707.jpg', 'title_long': 'Engineering Problem Solving With Matlab (Matlab Curriculum/Book and Disk)', 'edition': 'Book&Disk', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0 Inches, Length: 9.25195 Inches, Weight: 1.60276064474 Pounds, Width: 0.66929 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25195}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.66929}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.60276064474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}}, 'pages': 480, 'date_published': '1993', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Decision-Making & Problem Solving', 'Computers & Technology', 'Certification'], 'authors': ['D.M.
