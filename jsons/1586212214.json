{"book": {"publisher": "Grand Central Publishing", "synopsis": "In David Sedaris\" world, no one is safe and no cow is sacred. A manic cross between Mark Leyner, Fran Lebowitz, and the National Enquirer, Sedaris\" collection of essays is a rollicking tour through the national Zeitgeist: a do-it-yourself suburban dad saves money by performing home surgery; a man who is loved too much flees the heavyweight champion of the world; a teenage suicide tries to incite a lynch mob at her funeral; a bitter Santa abuses the elves.<br/><br/>David Sedaris made his debut on NPR\"s Morning Edition with 'SantaLand Diaries', recounting his strange-but-true experiences as an elf at Macy\'s, and soon became one of the show\'s most popular commentators. With a perfect eye and a voice infused with as much empathy as wit, Sedaris writes stories and essays that target the soulful ridiculousness of our behavior. Barrel Fever is like a blind date with modern life, and anything can happen.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/16/9781586212216.jpg", "title_long": "Barrel Fever and Other Stories", "edition": "Abridged", "dimensions": "height: 146 mm, length: 133 mm, width: 19 mm, weight: 91 g", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "mm", "value": 133}, "width": {"unit": "mm", "value": 19}, "weight": {"unit": "g", "value": 91}, "height": {"unit": "mm", "value": 146}}, "pages": 3, "date_published": "2001-10-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous'], 'authors": ["David Sedaris'], 'title": "Barrel Fever and Other Stories", "isbn13": "9781586212216", "msrp": 21.35, 'binding": "Audio CD", "isbn": "1586212214", "isbn10": "1586212214"}}
