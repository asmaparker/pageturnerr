Gone.<br/>They've survived hunger. They've survived lies. But the stakes keep rising, and the dystopian horror keeps building. Yet despite the simmering unrest left behind by so many battles, power struggles, and angry divides, there is a momentary calm in Perdido Beach.<br/>But enemies in the FAYZ don't just fade away, and in the quiet, deadly things are stirring, mutating, and finding their way free. The Darkness has found its way into the mind of its Nemesis at last and is controlling it through a haze of delirium and confusion. A highly contagious, fatal illness spreads at an alarming rate. Sinister, predatory insects terrorize Perdido Beach. And Sam, Astrid, Diana, and Caine are plagued by a growing doubt that they'll escape—or even survive—life in the FAYZ. With so much turmoil surrounding them, what desperate choices will they make when it comes to saving themselves and those they love?<br/>“Grant’s sf-fantasy thrillers continue to be the very definition of a page-turner.” —ALA Booklist<br/>Read the entire series: Gone Hunger Lies Plague Fear Light Monster Villain Hero", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/30/9780061449130.jpg', 'title_long': 'Plague (Gone, 4)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Width: 1.53 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.53}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2011-04-05', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Social Issues'], 'authors': ['Michael Grant'], 'title': 'Plague (Gone, 4)', 'isbn13': '9780061449130', 'msrp': 18.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '006144913X', 'isbn10': '006144913X'}}
