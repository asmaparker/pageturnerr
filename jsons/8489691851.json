{'book': {'publisher': 'Andres Bello', 'synopsis': "In Book of Twilight we meet a poet on the verge: Pablo Neruda--young, impassioned, vulnerable--poised to become one of the most beloved writers of our time. The precocious poet, then a teenager named Neftalï¿½ Ricardo Reyes Basoalto, reportedly sold his father's pocket watch to print the first copies of his debut book of poetry, one year before Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair placed Neruda on the world's stage. In Book of Twilight the voice is recognizable, even in nascent form--wildly romantic, musical, and bold--yet these poems are distinctly and charmingly adolescent, fluctuating between formality and rebellion. Book of Twilight offers a rare window into the early workings of a great mind; readers are privy to a profound transformation: the poet's becoming. Book of Twilight, originally titled Crepusculario, has never before been published in English in its entirety--the unveiling of this collection accompanies the thrilling discovery that became 2016's Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda Poems. In William O'Daly's lyrical translation, Pablo Neruda's first book is a treasure restored to its rightful place in a grand legacy. Within this early work is an important, raw power--the trembling effort that heralds genius.", 'language': 'es', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/58/9788489691858.jpg', 'title_long': 'Crepusculario', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.2 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.2}}, 'pages': 86, 'date_published': '1999', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural'], 'authors': ['Pablo Neruda'], 'title': 'Crepusculario', 'isbn13': '9788489691858', 'msrp': 6, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '8489691851', 'isbn10': '8489691851'}}
