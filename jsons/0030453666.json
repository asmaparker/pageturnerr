But men do the planning and make the decisions. This is no more strange to a Palauan than the fact that many children whose biological parents are still alive are adopted many times, and that material advantage should accrue from these transactions to several kinsmen of the child.Dr. Barnett lets the reader discover the answers to such seeming puzzles by taking him to the scene.
