{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'After going for more than a year without a date -- a record in New York City -- Marlowe Riddle has finally met a broodingly sexy, sharply intelligent man who is clearly interested in making more than polite conversation. The only problem: Joseph Kain is an NYPD detective clearly under the mistaken impression that Marlowe is a call girl.<br/>But while Marlowe does take money for spending time with strangers in her expensive Upper West Side apartment, she\'s a psychologist -- not Manhattan\'s answer to the Mayflower Madam! A fact she has no intention of telling Joe ... at least not until she finishes her research project on the "Behavioral Effects of Disguising Identity."<br/>But Marlowe\'s not the only one trying to secretively gain information ... and it\'s becoming increasingly unclear who is seducing whom. Because sometimes the only way to learn what a man really wants ... is to get him on the couch.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/92/9780060530792.jpg', 'title_long': 'On the Couch', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.56}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2004-06-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'City Life', 'Psychological', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance', 'New Adult & College', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Alisa Kwitney'], 'title': 'On the Couch', 'isbn13': '9780060530792', 'msrp': 10.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060530790', 'isbn10': '0060530790'}}
