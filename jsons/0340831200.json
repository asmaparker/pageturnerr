{"book": {"publisher": "Mobius", "synopsis": "Of the many Dalai Lama titles on sale, THE ART OF HAPPINESS - written with western psychiatrist Howard Cutler - is by far the biggest bestseller of them all. A huge international success, it has sold over 2 million copies worldwide, with nearly 300,000 of these in the UK alone. Now, this inspirational new book brings the successful East-meets-West pairing together again to provide a practical application of Tibetan Buddhist spiritual values to the world of work.In this wise and practical book, the Dalai Lama shows us how to place our working lives into the context of our lives as a whole. Rather than striving to find a role which suits us, we should allow our work to arise naturally from who we are - and what is most important to us. From here we reach a pathway that can lead us to true life fulfilment and purpose.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/05/9780340831205.jpg", "title_long": "The Art of Happiness at Work", "dimensions": "Height: 7.83463 Inches, Length: 5.15747 Inches, Weight: 0.33951188348 Pounds, Width: 0.59055 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15747}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.59055}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.33951188348}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.83463}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Motivational', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Occupational & Organizational', 'History', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Dalai Lama'], 'authors": ["Dalai Lama'], 'title": "The Art of Happiness at Work", "isbn13": "9780340831205", "msrp": 18.6, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0340831200", "isbn10": "0340831200"}}
