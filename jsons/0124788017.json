{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press, Inc.', 'synopsis': 'Applied Atomic Collision Physics, Volume 5: Special Topics deals with topics on applications of atomic collisions that were not covered in the first four volumes of the treatise. The book opens with a chapter on ultrasensitive chemical detectors. This is followed by separate chapters on lighting, magnetohydrodynamic electrical power generation, gas breakdown and high voltage insulating gases, thermionic energy converters, and charged particle detectors. Subsequent chapters deal with the operation of multiwire drift and proportional chambers and streamer chambers and their use in high energy physics experiments; photoelectron spectroscopy of negative ions and the chemical information that can be obtained from such studies; and the determination of intermolecular potentials. Also discussed are studies on the determination of ion molecular potential curves using photodissociative processes; determination of negative ion thermo chemical data using ion-neutral reactions; gas-phase chemical reactions; collision phenomena in electrical discharge lamps; and military applications of atomic and molecular physics.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/15/9780124788015.jpg', 'title_long': 'Applied Atomic Collision Physics.
