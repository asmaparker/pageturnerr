{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "Headed by the larger-than-life figure of Professor Challenger, a scientific expedition sets out to explore a plateau in South America that remains frozen in time from the days when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Seemingly impossible to penetrate, this lost world holds great danger for the four men, whether from fiendish ape-men or terrifying prehistoric creatures. Arthur Conan Doyle"s classic tale of adventure and discovery still excites the reader today just as dinosaurs continue to grip the popular imagination.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/27/28/9780142002728.jpg", "title_long": "The Lost World", "edition": "Tie-in", "dimensions": "Height: 7.66 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.65}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.66}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2002-09-03", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives'], 'authors": ["Arthur Conan Doyle'], 'title": "The Lost World", "isbn13": "9780142002728", "msrp": 9, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0142002720", "isbn10": "0142002720"}}
