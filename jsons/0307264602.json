She must pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, for in a time of declining birthrates her value lies in her fertility, and failure means exile to the dangerously polluted Colonies. Offred can remember a time when she lived with her husband and daughter and had a job, before she lost even her own name. Now she navigates the intimate secrets of those who control her every move, risking her life in breaking the rules.<br/><br/>Like Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, The Handmaid"s Tale has endured not only as a literary landmark but as a warning of a possible future that is still chillingly relevant.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/02/9780307264602.jpg", "title_long": "The Handmaid"s Tale", 'edition": "unknown", "dimensions": "Height: 8.33 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 1.075 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.075}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.33}}, "pages": 350, "date_published": "2006-10-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopian', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Margaret Atwood'], 'title": "The Handmaid"s Tale", 'isbn13": "9780307264602", "msrp": 25, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0307264602", "isbn10": "0307264602"}}
