Frightened villagers plead with the Mayor and Town Councilors to do something about the rats. No one knows what to do; until one day, a Pied Piper with his magical wooden pipe proposes, " For a Thousand gold pieces, this magic pipe will rid your town of rats." Sure enough, the Pied Piper succeeds in his endeavor only to be tricked by the Mayor. The Piper plays his magic pipe one more time leading the town\'s most precious asset to an enchanted valley.
