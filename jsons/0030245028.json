{'book': {'publisher': 'South-Western College Pub', 'synopsis': 'In writing this textbook, Mankiw has tried to put himself in the position of someone seeing economics for the first time. The author\'s conversational writing style is superb for presenting the politics and science of economic theories to tomorrow\'s decision-makers. Because Mankiw wrote it for the students, the book stands out among all other principle texts by intriguing students to apply an economic way of thinking in their daily lives. Receiving such praise as "perhaps the best ever" textbook in economic principles, it\'s no wonder Mankiw\'s prize project has quickly become one of the most successful books ever to be published in the college marketplace.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/22/9780030245022.jpg', 'title_long': 'PRINCIPLES OF MICROECONOMICS', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 0.75 Inches, Weight: 2.18037177118 Pounds, Width: 8.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.18037177118}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 488, 'date_published': '1997-08-04', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Instruction Methods', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['MANKIW'], 'title': 'PRINCIPLES OF MICROECONOMICS', 'isbn13': '9780030245022', 'msrp': 149.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0030245028', 'isbn10': '0030245028', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780176727895', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
