{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "William Gaddis published four novels during his lifetime, immense and complex books that helped inaugurate a new movement in American letters. Now comes his final work of fiction, a subtle, concentrated culmination of his art and ideas. For more than fifty years Gaddis collected notes for a book about the mechanization of the arts, told by way of a social history of the player piano in America. In the years before his death in 1998, he distilled the whole mass into a fiction, a dramatic monologue by an elderly man with a terminal illness. Continuing Gaddis"s career-long reflection on those aspects of corporate technological culture that are uniquely destructive of the arts, Agape Agape is a stunning achievement from one of the indisputable masters of postwar American fiction.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/36/9780142437636.jpg", "title_long": "Agape Agape (Penguin Classics)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 0.36 Inches, Length: 7.86 Inches, Weight: 0.26 Pounds, Width: 5.06 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.86}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.06}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.26}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.36}}, "pages": 144, "date_published": "2003-09-30", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["William Gaddis'], 'title": "Agape Agape (Penguin Classics)", "isbn13": "9780142437636", "msrp": 14, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1440650039"}, "isbn": "0142437638", "isbn10": "0142437638", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781440650031", "binding": "print"}]}}
