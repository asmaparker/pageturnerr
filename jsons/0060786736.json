{"book": {"publisher": "William Morrow", "synopsis": "“Full of suspense, surprises, and sympathetic characters.”<br/>—Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel<br/>“No mystery series I can think of captures the sadness and loss that swept over England after World War I with the heartbreaking force of Charles Todd’s books about Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge.”<br/>—Chicago Tribune<br/>The remarkable Charles Todd has created one of the most unforgettable characters in mystery and crime fiction: Inspector Ian Rutledge, shell-shocked veteran of “the Great War.” A False Mirror is one of Todd’s most powerful novels, plunging his tormented protagonist into the center of a brutal crime that painfully echoes events in Rutledge’s own past. Poignant, evocative, and continually surprising, A False Mirror is further proof that Charles Todd is well deserving of the critical acclaim the Rutledge novels have earned; a New York Times bestselling author who belongs among the acknowledged masters of the genre, including P. D. James, Elizabeth George, Ruth Rendell, and Jacqueline Winspear.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/67/31/9780060786731.jpg", "title_long": "A False Mirror (Inspector Ian Rutledge)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.425 Pounds, Width: 1.21 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.21}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.425}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 371, "date_published": "2007-01-09", "subjects": ["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Historical', 'Cozy', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors": ["Charles Todd'], 'title": "A False Mirror (Inspector Ian Rutledge)", "isbn13": "9780060786731", "msrp": 23.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0060786736", "isbn10": "0060786736"}}
