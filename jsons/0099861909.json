{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage Books', 'synopsis': "In the struggle for women's equality, there is one subject still shrouded in silence - women's compulsive pursuit of beauty. The myth of female beauty challenges every woman, every day of her life. The author exposes the tyranny of the beauty myth through the ages and its oppressive function today, in the home and at work, in literature and the media, in relationships between men and women, between women and women. With examples, she confronts the beauty industry and its advertising and uncovers the reasons why women are consumed by this destructive obsession.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/04/9780099861904.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Beauty Myth : How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.54233716452 Pounds, Width: 0.86614 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86614}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.54233716452}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 348, 'date_published': '1991', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', "Women's Studies", 'Feminist Theory'], 'authors': ['Naomi Wolf'], 'title': 'The Beauty Myth : How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women', 'isbn13': '9780099861904', 'msrp': 16.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099861909', 'isbn10': '0099861909'}}
