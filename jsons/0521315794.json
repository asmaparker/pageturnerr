{"book": {"publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "synopsis": "This book is an advanced critical introduction to Greek tragedy. It is written specifically for the reader who does not know Greek and who may be unfamiliar with the context of the Athenian drama festival but who nevertheless wants to appreciate the plays in all their complexity. Simon Goldhill aims to combine the best contemporary scholarly criticism in classics with a wide knowledge of modern literary studies in other fields. He discusses the masterpieces of Athenian drama in the light of contemporary critical controversies in such a way as to enable the student or scholar not only to understand and appreciate the texts of the most commonly read plays, but also to evaluate and utilize the range of approaches to the problems of ancient drama.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/91/9780521315791.jpg", "title_long": "Reading Greek Tragedy", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1243575362 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.79}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.1243575362}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 316, "date_published": "1986-05-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Ancient & Classical', 'Tragedy', 'Ancient & Medieval Literature', 'Greek', 'Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Simon Goldhill'], 'title": "Reading Greek Tragedy", "isbn13": "9780521315791", "msrp": 46.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0521315794", "isbn10": "0521315794"}}
