{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': "<p>As winner of the highly prestigious IMPAC International Dublin Literary Award, Wide Open beat out books by such masters as Toni Morrison, Philip Roth, and Michael Cunningham. It is truly extraordinary work of fiction, taking readers into a small English seaside town, and into the minds and hearts of its remarkable inhabitants -- a man named Ronny, weed killer by trade, who has some strange things in common with a man he finds dangling from a bridge; Nathan, the son of a pedophile, who toils in the Underground's Lost Property department, endlessly logging missing items; Sara, purveyor of her family boar farm, and Lily, her teenage daughter, tragically born with unformed organs and blood that refuses to clot. Starkly original and at turns hilarious, sad, and hopeful, Wide Open brilliantly displays Nicola Barker's delightfully singular literary talent.</p>", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/53/9780060933753.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wide Open', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Width: 0.690909 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.690909}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'British & Irish', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Nicola Barker'], 'title': 'Wide Open', 'isbn13': '9780060933753', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060933755', 'isbn10': '0060933755', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781453288238', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
