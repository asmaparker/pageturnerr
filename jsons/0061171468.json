{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "James Pinocchio wakes up in the back of a New York City taxi with a combination lock piercing his left ear and no idea how it got there, or what the combination is.<br/>The following day, his wealthy parents decide they've had enough, and they send him off to Sleepy Hollow, the famous rehab facility in Upstate New York. While there, Mr. Pinocchio meets all sorts of Fascinating Characters, one more Unbelievable and Amazing than the next, and they challenge him to confront his Deepest, Darkest Fears. The experience leads Mr. Pinocchio to the very edges of despair, but at a critical juncture he finds hope in the arms of a Bad Woman.<br/>The love affair ends tragically, alas, and, like many parts of Mr. Pinocchio's story, stretches credibility to the breaking point, but the harrowing adventure -- which involves a great deal of pain, a smattering of dirty sex, and endless amounts of girlish crying -- eventually leads to Redemption and Healing. But not for Mr. Pinocchio", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/68/9780061171468.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Million Little Lies', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.56 Inches, Length: 8.02 Inches, Weight: 0.5070632026 Pounds, Width: 5.08 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.02}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.08}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5070632026}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.56}}, 'pages': 191, 'date_published': '2006-03-28', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Parodies', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous'], 'authors': ['James Pinocchio', 'Pablo F.
