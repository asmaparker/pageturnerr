{"book": {"publisher": "Collins", "synopsis": "Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership -- or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.<br/><br/>Focusing on "disruptive technology" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel\"s 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss 'the next great wave.' Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, 'The Innovator\'s Dilemma' presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/19/98/9780060521998.jpg", "title_long": "The Innovator"s Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book that Will Change the Way You Do Business (Collins Business Essentials)", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2003", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Management', 'Skills', 'Communications'], 'authors": ["Clayton M.
