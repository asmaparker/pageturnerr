{'book': {'publisher': 'It Books', 'synopsis': 'The epitome of grace, independence, and wit, Lauren Bacall continues to project an audacious spirit and pursue on-screen excellence. The product of an extraordinary mother and a loving extended family, she produced, with Humphrey Bogart, some of the most electric and memorable scenes in movie history. After tragically losing Bogart, she returned to New York and a brilliant career in the theatre. A two-time Tony winner, she married and later divorced her second love, Jason Robards, and never lost sight of the strength that made her a star.<br/>Now, thirty years after the publication of her original National Book Awardâ€“winning memoir, Bacall has added new material to her inspiring history. In her own frank and beautiful words, one of our most enduring actresses reveals the remarkable true story of a lifetime so rich with incident and achievement that Hollywood itself would be unable to adequately reproduce it.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/15/9780061127915.jpg', 'title_long': 'By Myself and Then Some', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.32 Inches, Length: 8.05 Inches, Weight: 1.06 Pounds, Width: 5.31 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.05}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.06}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.32}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2006-10-31', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Photography & Video', 'Film & Video Art', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Theatre', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'History & Criticism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lauren Bacall'], 'title': 'By Myself and Then Some', 'isbn13': '9780061127915', 'msrp': 12.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0062016598'}, 'isbn': '0061127914', 'isbn10': '0061127914', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062016591', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
