Naturally, the emphasis is on meat, and Ozeki has fun with out-there recipes such as rump roast in coke and beef fudge; but as Jane becomes more familiar with her subject, she becomes increasingly aware of the beef industry\'s widespread practice of using synthetic estrogens on their cattle and determines to sabotage the program.<br/><br/>Cut to Tokyo where Akiko Ueno struggles through the dull misery of life with her brutish husband, who happens to be in charge of the show\'s advertising. After seeing one of Jane\'s subversive episodes about a vegetarian lesbian couple, Akiko gets in touch and the two women plot to expose the meat industry\'s hazardous practices.
