{"book": {"publisher": "Bloomsbury USA", "synopsis": "Very evil....very funny<br/><br/>A lethal joyride into today"s new breed of technogeeks, Douglas Coupland"s new novel updates Microserfs for the age of Google.<br/>Ethan Jarlewski and five co-workers are bureaucratically marooned in JPod, a no-escape architectural limbo on the fringes of a massive Vancouver video game design company.<br/>The six JPodders wage daily battle against the demands of a boneheaded marketing staff, who daily torture employees with idiotic changes to already idiotic games. Meanwhile, Ethan"s personal life is shaped (or twisted) by phenomena as disparate as Hollywood, marijuana grow-ops, people-smuggling, ballroom dancing, and the rise of China. JPod's universe is amoral and shameless - and dizzyingly fast-paced. The characters are products of their era even as they're creating it. Everybody in Ethan's life inhabits a moral grey zone. Nobody is exempt, not even his seemingly straitlaced parents or Coupland himself. Full of word games, visual jokes, and sideways jabs, this book throws a sharp, pointed lawn dart into the heart of contemporary life. JPod is Douglas Coupland at the top of his game.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/48/9781596911048.jpg", "title_long": "JPod", "dimensions": "Height: 9.53 Inches, Length: 6.42 Inches, Weight: 1.75 Pounds, Width: 1.5649575 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.42}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5649575}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.53}}, "pages": 448, "date_published": "2006-05-16", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous'], 'authors": ["Douglas Coupland'], 'title": "JPod", "isbn13": "9781596911048", "msrp": 24.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1596911042", "isbn10": "1596911042"}}
