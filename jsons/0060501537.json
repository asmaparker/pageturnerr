{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': 'Set in the remote, northeastern hills of India, The point of return revolves around the father-son relationship of a willful, curious boy, Babu, and Doctor Dam, an enigmatic product of British colonial rule and Nehruvian nationalism. Told in reverse chronological order, the novel examines an India where the ideals that brought freedom from colonial rule are beginning to crack under the pressure of new rebellions and conflicts. For Dr. Dam and Babu, this has meant living as strangers in the same home, puzzled and resentful, tied only by blood. As the father grows weary and old and the son tries to understand him, clashes between ethnic groups in their small town show them to be strangers to their country as well. Before long, Babu finds himself embarking on a great journey, an odyssey through the memories of his father, his family, and his nation.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/32/9780060501532.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Point of Return: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2004-03-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Siddhartha Deb'], 'title': 'The Point of Return: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060501532', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060501537', 'isbn10': '0060501537'}}
