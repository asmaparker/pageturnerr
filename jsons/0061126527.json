Alex blasts through the bars of South Beach and points her search south to Key West and Cuba, laying waste to Miami hit men, dodging Palmetto bugs big enough to eat her alive, and putting the pedal to the metal with NASCAR driver Sam Hooker. Engaged in a deadly race, Wild Bill\'s "borrowed" Hooker\'s sixty-five-foot Hatteras and sailed off into the sunset...just when Hooker has plans for the boat. Hooker figures he\'ll attach himself to Alex and maybe run into scumbag Bill. The race to the finish is hot and hard.<br/>Performed by C. J.
