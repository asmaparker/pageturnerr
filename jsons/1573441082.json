{"book": {"publisher": "Cleis Press", "synopsis": "Black Like Us chronicles 100 years of the African American lesbian, gay, and bisexual literary tradition. Beginning with the turn-of-the-century writings of Angelina Welde Grimke and Alice Dunbar Nelson, it charts the evolution of black lesbian and gay fiction into the Harlem Renaissance of Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen and the later postwar era, in which works by Audre Lorde and James Baldwin signal the emerging sexual liberation movements. The 40 authors featured also include Alice Walker, E. Lynn Harris, Audre Lorde, April Sinclair, Jewelle Gomez, Thomas Glave, and Jacqueline Woodson.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/87/9781573441087.jpg", "title_long": "Black Like Us: A Century of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual African American Fiction", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.85408762342 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.85408762342}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 600, "date_published": "2002-05-28", "subjects": ["LGBTQ+ Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'United States', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'LGBTQ+ Demographic Studies'], 'authors": [], "title": "Black Like Us: A Century of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual African American Fiction", "isbn13": "9781573441087", "msrp": 29.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1573441082", "isbn10": "1573441082"}}
