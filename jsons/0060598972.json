{"book": {"publisher": "HarperCollins", "synopsis": "Muhammad was born in 570 CE, and over the following sixty years built a thriving spiritual community, laying the foundations of a religion that changed the course of world history. There is more historical data on his life than on that of the founder of any other major faith, and yet his story is little known.<br/>Karen Armstrong"s immaculately researched new biography of Muhammad will enable readers to understand the true origins and spirituality of a faith that is all too often misrepresented as cruel, intolerant, and inherently violent. An acclaimed authority on religious and spiritual issues, Armstrong offers a balanced, in-depth portrait, revealing the man at the heart of Islam by dismantling centuries of misconceptions. Armstrong demonstrates that Muhammad"s life—a pivot point in history—has genuine relevance to the global crises we face today.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/89/76/9780060598976.jpg", "title_long": "Muhammad: A Prophet for Our Time (Eminent Lives)", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 7.12 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.83}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.12}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2006-10-17", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'Middle East', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'History', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Islam', 'Muhammed', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Karen Keishin Armstrong'], 'title": "Muhammad: A Prophet for Our Time (Eminent Lives)", "isbn13": "9780060598976", "msrp": 21.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0060598972", "isbn10": "0060598972"}}
