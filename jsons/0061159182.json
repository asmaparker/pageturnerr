But the situation is grim at the hospital, which has been devastated by severe budget cutbacks and staff shortages. And when a respected nurse vanishes along with a newborn from the nursery, Peter and Rina fear for the safety of their own precious child—especially when the missing nurse's car is found at the bottom of a cliff . . . with a corpse inside.<br/>A most grievous sin has been committed. In pursuit of justice, Decker—with the help of his tough-as-nails partner, Marge, and an able assist from his teenage daughter, Cindy—follows a twisted path that winds through a sinister maze of hospital politics, misplaced passions, and torturous mind games that can all too easily lead to murder.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/83/9780061159183.jpg', 'title_long': 'Grievous Sin (Decker/Lazarus Novels, 6)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.08 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.08}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2007-06-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Faye Kellerman'], 'title': 'Grievous Sin (Decker/Lazarus Novels, 6)', 'isbn13': '9780061159183', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061159182', 'isbn10': '0061159182'}}
