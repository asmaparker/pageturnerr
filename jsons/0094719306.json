{'book': {'publisher': 'Constable & Robinson Ltd', 'synopsis': 'This is a thrilling piece of historical reconstruction. Patrick Howarth draws on the wealth of evidence provided by recent archaeological finds, as well as on Hungarian sources not known in the West, to give us the first authentic account of the life of Attila.<br/>He also provides a careful study of the Attila legends which grew up through the centuries, ranging from Roman chronicle through the Nibelungenlied to Hollywood epic. The contrast between fiction and truth is startling.<br/>The early Christian chroniclers called Attila the Scourge of God and thought he had been sent to punish people for their sins. Italian artists portrayed him with horns. The resulting popular picture was of a bloodthirsty tyrant. Basing his presentation in particular on an account left by a man who dined with Attila and knew his family, Patrick Howarth shows him to have been a man of clemency, tolerance and wisdom, albeit a highly successful man of war.<br/>Attila reigned for only eight years. After consolidating an empire which extended to the Caspian he came near to toppling the Roman Empire in both East and West. At one point he was at the gates of Constantinople, demanding and receiving large tributes in gold. His armies then marched through France and Italy, capturing one great city after another.<br/>The sister of a Roman emperor sent him a ring as a proposal of marriage, and he left Italy only after a dramatic meeting with Pope Leo the Great.<br/>He died on his wedding night after he returned from Italy. His grave is still being sought.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/09/9780094719309.jpg', 'title_long': 'Attila, King of the Huns: Man and Myth', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.13317602668 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.13317602668}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '1994', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs'], 'authors': ['Patrick Howarth'], 'title': 'Attila, King of the Huns: Man and Myth', 'isbn13': '9780094719309', 'msrp': 42.5, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0094719306', 'isbn10': '0094719306'}}
