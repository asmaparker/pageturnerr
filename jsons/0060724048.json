{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Annie Darling, owner of the Death on Demand mystery bookstore, is understandably upset. It isn't like her p.i. husband Max to abruptly disappear—and homicide is definitely not his style. But when his car is found abandoned on a remote road with a brutally slain, once-beautiful young woman nearby and the murder weapon stashed in the trunk, Annie's worst fears seem justified.<br/>The police have Max all but tried and convicted—except for Chief Billy Cameron, whose unshakable belief in his friend's innocence prompts his removal from the case. And as a media circus descends on tiny Broward's Rock, Annie will have to place her own life in jeopardy to clear her husband's name. But time is running out—and she has only one slim chance to unmask a killer who just may have committed the perfect crime.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/47/9780060724047.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dead Days of Summer (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 17)', 'edition': 'First Avon Paperback Printing, April 2007; Avon Books, An Imprint of HarperCollins Publishers', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.36 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.84}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.36}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2007-03-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Books & Reading', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Carolyn Hart'], 'title': 'Dead Days of Summer (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 17)', 'isbn13': '9780060724047', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061840130'}, 'isbn': '0060724048', 'isbn10': '0060724048', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061840135', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
