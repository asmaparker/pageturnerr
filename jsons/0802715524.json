They also represent six eras that span the course of civilization―from the adoption of agriculture, to the birth of cities, to the advent of globalization. A History of the World in 6 Glasses tells the story of humanity from the Stone Age to the twenty-first century through each epoch’s signature refreshment. As Standage persuasively argues, each drink is in fact a kind of technology, advancing culture and catalyzing the intricate interplay of different societies. After reading this enlightening book, you may never look at your favorite drink in quite the same way again.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/24/9780802715524.jpg", "title_long": "A History of the World in 6 Glasses", "edition": "Annotated", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.4499891 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4499891}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.9}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2006-05-16", "subjects": ["Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Beverages & Wine', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Homebrewing, Distilling & Wine Making', 'Cooking Education & Reference', 'History', 'World'], 'authors": ["Tom Standage'], 'title": "A History of the World in 6 Glasses", "isbn13": "9780802715524", "msrp": 18, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0802718590", "ePub": "0802718590"}, "isbn": "0802715524", "isbn10": "0802715524", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780802718594", "binding": "print"}]}}
