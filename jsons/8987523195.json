{'book': {'publisher': 'Cham Publishing Co.', 'synopsis': 'Every human has the right to be happy, but nobody has provided a way to achieve that happiness. World Beyond World provides the answer. If one understands what the mind is, he is already on the path to happiness. Then what is the mind? And how can we discard all that clutters it? Woo Myung has written World Beyond World which is the first book to provide answers by defining what the mind is and how we can eliminate all pain and suffering by ridding ourselves of the individual self centered mind, thereby attaining true happiness. Woo Myung shares his story of how he became Truth and also reveals the method for others to do the same. He explains the step-by-step process for completely awakening the human consciousness and clearly defines the difference between heaven and hell; heaven is the reality of the true world and hell is the dream of illusions, which the human mind is trapped in. Woo Myung explains why we must awaken from our illusions and live in the world of reality. World Beyond World also includes beautiful poetry that will assist in awakening the human consciousness.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/94/9788987523194.jpg', 'title_long': 'World Beyond World (English)', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.1 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2005-05-05', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'New Thought', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Metaphysics', 'Methodology'], 'authors': ['Woo Myung'], 'title': 'World Beyond World (English)', 'isbn13': '9788987523194', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '8987523195', 'isbn10': '8987523195'}}
