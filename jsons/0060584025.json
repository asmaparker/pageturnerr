{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTorch', 'synopsis': 'A spectacular new novel, complete with high stakes, hot nights, murder and graft―not to mention car chases, car races, car explosions, and car―well, you get the idea<br/><br/>Alexandra Barnaby got the brains in her family. The little gray cells certainly bypassed Barney’s younger brother, Wild Bill. Now Bill’s missing, so Barney is dispatched to Florida in the middle of summer with the bugs and the heat and the bad-hair-day humidity. Barney’s thinking things can’t get too much worse as she makes the rounds of South Beach, unemployed and sunburned, following her brother’s trail of broken-hearted bimbos.<br/>Too bad for Barney―she’s wrong about the getting worse part. Enter Sam Hooker. Somebody’s stolen his boat and the trail leads to―you guessed it―Wild Bill. Hooker decides to follow Barney and see if she can lead him to his boat.<br/>In the world of Evanovich, Sam Hooker and Alexandra Barnaby, in their quest to reclaim what’s theirs, blast through Florida from Daytona straight on to Key West, exposing a plot to grab Cuban land and to lay waste the people involved. Cussing and tasteless sexual innuendo included.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/23/9780060584023.jpg', 'title_long': 'Metro Girl (Alex Barnaby Series #1)', 'edition': '256', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 0.96 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 4.19 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-09-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'Action & Adventure', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Sports', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Janet Evanovich'], 'title': 'Metro Girl (Alex Barnaby Series #1)', 'isbn13': '9780060584023', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061798185', 'ePub': '0061798185'}, 'isbn': '0060584025', 'isbn10': '0060584025', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061798184', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
