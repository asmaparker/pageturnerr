{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'The matchless Munro makes art out of everyday lives in this dazzling new collection. At its centre are three stories connected into one marvellously rich narrative about Juliet - who escapes from teaching at a girls\' school and throws herself into a wild and passionate love match. Here are men and women of wildly different times and circumstances, their lives made vividly palpable by the nuance and empathy of Munro\'s writing. "Runaway" is about the power and betrayals of love, about lost children, lost chances. There is pain and desolation beneath the surface, like a needle in the heart, which makes these stories more powerful and compelling than anything she has written.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/54/9780099472254.jpg', 'title_long': 'Runaway', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.5621787681 Pounds, Width: 0.86614 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86614}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5621787681}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 335, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Alice Munro'], 'title': 'Runaway', 'isbn13': '9780099472254', 'msrp': 12.25, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099472252', 'isbn10': '0099472252'}}
