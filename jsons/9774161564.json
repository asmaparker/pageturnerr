{'book': {'publisher': 'The American University in Cairo Press', 'synopsis': 'The novelist’s camera pans from the dome of King Fuad University (now Cairo University) to students streaming out of the campus, focusing on four students in their twenties, each representing a different trend in Egypt in the 1930s. Finally the camera comes to rest on Mahgub Abd al-Da’im. A scamp, he fancies himself a nihilist, a hedonist, an egotist, but his personal vulnerability is soon revealed by a family crisis back home in al-Qanatir, a dusty, provincial town on the Nile that is also a popular destination for Cairene day-trippers. Mahgub, like many characters in works by Naguib Mahfouz, has a hard time finding the correct setting on his ambition gauge. His emotional life also fluctuates between the extremes of a street girl, who makes her living gathering cigarette butts, and his wealthy cousin Tahiya. Since he thinks that virtue is merely a social construct, how far will our would-be nihilist go in trying to fulfill his unbridled ambitions? What if he discovers that high society is more corrupt and cynical than he is? With a wink back at Goethe’s Faust and Henry Fielding’s Joseph Andrews, Mahgub becomes a willing collaborator in his own corruption. Published in Arabic in the 1940s, this cautionary morality tale about self-defeating egoism and ill-digested foreign philosophies comes from the same period as one of the writer’s best known works, Midaq Alley. Both novels are comic and heart-felt indictments not so much of Egyptian society between the world wars as of human nature and our paltry attempts to establish just societies.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/68/9789774161568.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cairo Modern', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.1 Inches, Length: 9.3 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.1}}, 'pages': 248, 'date_published': '2008-05-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Naguib Mahfouz'], 'title': 'Cairo Modern', 'isbn13': '9789774161568', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '9774161564', 'isbn10': '9774161564'}}
