{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "Murray Walker is a national institution. The turbo-tongued motor-racing commentator who played a key role in the shaping of Formula One's televised image over the past three decades, Murray's unique brand of boyish enthusiasm made even the dullest race sound like an unmissable thriller. There was no one remotely like him on television -- and the public loved him.<br/>Ever since his first stint at the microphone in 1949 at the British Grand Prix, Murray has entertained us with his commentaries on car and motorcycle racing and in particular Formula One. In his autobiography, he describes his relationship with many of the key personalities of his era, from Geoff Duke to Mike Hailwood, Stirling Moss to John Surtees, Nigel Mansell to Ayrton Senna, and Damon Hill to current world champion Michael Schumacher.<br/>He also recalls his celebrated commentary partnerships, initially with the inimitable James Hunt and later with martin Brundle, his surprise move from the BBC to ITV, and looks at how the sport has evolved from its humble beginnings to today's multi-billion pound industry.<br/>Away from the pit lane, he talks about his early personal life and the influence of his father Graham, about his experiences in the war with the Royal Scots Greys, and later his fascinating and highly successful career as an advertising executive handling major blue-chip companies such as Esso and Mars.<br/>In the drama-filled world of Formula One, Murray Walker's story is a refreshingly candid and straight-talking account of a sport he adores and which every one of his fans across the world should read.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/06/9780060542306.jpg', 'title_long': "Murray Walker: Unless I'm Very Much Mistaken", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.76 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.76}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2002-09', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Biographies', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Murray Walker'], 'title': "Murray Walker: Unless I'm Very Much Mistaken", 'isbn13': '9780060542306', 'msrp': 25, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060542306', 'isbn10': '0060542306'}}
