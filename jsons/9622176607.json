{'book': {'publisher': 'Odyssey Books & Maps', 'synopsis': 'The Father of our Country and perhaps the greatest statesman in America\'s history, George Washington is the quintessential American icon. But despite his legendary status, Washington the man remains an enigma. A magnificent horseman, a dancer of consummate grace, a skilled surveyor, Washington was to become commander-in-chief and supreme hero of the War of Independence, and first president of the United States of America. In this illuminating biographical sketch, scholar and author Albert Lafarge reveals the man behind the myth--a gentleman farmer "called from the plow to rule a great people like a second Cincinnatus." Lavishly illustrated and printed in color throughout. The American Icon Close-Up Guide Series: The United States, in its relatively short life, has acquired an amazingly rich vein of history and legend. The American Icon Close-Up Guide series is designed to give the reader a brief, but fascinating, introduction to the wealth of treasures in the nation\'s past and present. Beautifully and clearly written by acknowledged experts, with outstanding illustrations, the titles in the series will build up to an unrivaled picture of what has made the United States of today.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/07/9789622176607.jpg', 'title_long': 'George Washington (American Icon Close-Up Guides)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59965735264}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '1750', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Presidents & Heads of State', "Children's Books"], 'authors': ['Albert LaFarge'], 'title': 'George Washington (American Icon Close-Up Guides)', 'isbn13': '9789622176607', 'msrp': 11.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '9622176607', 'isbn10': '9622176607'}}
