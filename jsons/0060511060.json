She\"s trying her best to do exactly as she\"s told, but pitching a tent is not the same as throwing it into the bushes, and catching a fish with your bare hands isn\"t easy. As usual, the mixed-up housekeeper makes this camping trip one hugely entertaining adventure. This Level 2 I Can Read is perfect for kids who read on their own but still need a little help.<br/>'No child can resist Amelia [Bedelia] and her literal trips through the minefield of the English language—and no adult can fail to notice that she\'s usually right when she\'s wrong.'—The New York Times Book Review', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/10/67/9780060511067.jpg", "title_long": "Amelia Bedelia Goes Camping (I Can Read Level 2)", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 0.19 Inches, Length: 9.05 Inches, Weight: 0.0005732018812 pounds, Width: 6.07 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.05}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.07}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.0005732018812}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.19}}, "pages": 57, "date_published": "2003-04-15", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Chapter Books & Readers', 'Education & Reference', 'Humor', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Peggy Parish'], 'title": "Amelia Bedelia Goes Camping (I Can Read Level 2)", "isbn13": "9780060511067", "msrp": 4.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060511060", "isbn10": "0060511060"}}
