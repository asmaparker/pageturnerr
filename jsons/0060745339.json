{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': 'At the age of ten, a young Iranian girl witnesses the horror of her father\'s execution and escapes the revolution with her sister.<br/>Growing up in Tehran in the 1970s, Afschineh Latifi and her sister and two brothers enjoyed a life of luxury and privilege. Their father, a selfâ€“made man, had worked his way up from nothing to become a colonel in the Shah\'s army, and their mother, a woman of equally modest roots, had made a career for herself as a respected schoolteacher. But in February, 1979, Colonel Latifi was arrested by members of the newly installed Khomeini regime, and publicly pilloried as an "Enemy of God." Some months later, after having been shunted from one prison cell to another, and without benefit of a legitimate trial, Colonel Latifi was summarily executed. Fearing for the safety of her children, Mrs. Latifi made a wrenching decision: to send her daughters, ages ten and eleven, to the west, splitting up the family until they could safely reunite. Out on their own, Afschineh and her sister, Afsaneh, were forced to become strong young women before they\'d even had a childhood.<br/>Even After All This Time is a story of hope and heartache, a story of a family torn apart for six harrowing years, and finally coming together to rebuild in America. In the richly evocative tradition of the bestselling Reading Lolita in Tehran, this is a story of a family that had the courage to dream impossible dreams and to make them come true against impossible odds.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/32/9780060745332.jpg', 'title_long': 'Even After All This Time: A Story of Love, Revolution, and Leaving Iran', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-03-29', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'Middle East', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'Iran', 'Politics & Social Sciences', "Women's Studies"], 'authors': ['Afschineh Latifi', 'Pablo F.
