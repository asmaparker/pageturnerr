{'book': {'publisher': 'Pearson College Div', 'synopsis': "This book shows readers how philosophy of education relates to and influences classroom practice. The book presents the authors' own philosophy of education and places it in the context of a broad range of other classic and contemporary perspectives. Within each chapter the theory is related to schools and classrooms as they really exist including issues and problems that teachers, parents, students, and administrators face daily. The book is easily accessible in approach, cutting-edge in its multicultural and feminist focus, and rich in its development of philosophical issues.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/34/9780132424134.jpg', 'title_long': 'Philosophy Applied to Education: Nurturing a Democratic Community in the Classroom', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 0.86641668966 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.86641668966}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 236, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Education Theory', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Barbara J.
