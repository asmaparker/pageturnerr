How often do you identify what‘s good about your friends, spouse, lover, or children埡nd actually put it into words so there can be no doubt? Most of us don‘t take the time to find the good and praise it殲 we don‘t even know how.<br/>This little book is designed to change that. Intended to be a token of affection in our busy lives, it‘s a tool that can promote real intimacy and all its rewards by helping us to catch our relationships at their best, to take a snapshot of what is the happiest, most wholesome and wondrous about the people in our lives. This book serves as a prompter, a reminder and it can be seen and shared.<br/>What I Love Most About You is in a small gift format, with both pre–made and do–it–yourself elements. Between the pages you will find a long list of attributes that enable readers to highlight and asterisk, personalising it for the one they love.<br/>Included also are blank pages for special notes, love aphorisms and illustrations. It is the perfect expression of love, even when one isn‘t sure how to express it.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/50/9780066214450.jpg', 'title_long': 'What I Love Most About You: A Keepsake Book for the One I Treasure', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.5070632026 Pounds, Width: 0.499027 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.499027}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5070632026}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}}, 'pages': 121, 'date_published': '2002-01', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Love & Romance', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['None'], 'title': 'What I Love Most About You: A Keepsake Book for the One I Treasure', 'isbn13': '9780066214450', 'msrp': 9.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0066214459', 'isbn10': '0066214459'}}
