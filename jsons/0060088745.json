In this gripping account, James Shapiro sets out to answer this question,
        "succeed[ing] where others have fallen short." (Boston Globe)<br/>1599 was an epochal year for Shakespeare and England. During that year, Shakespeare wrote four of his most famous plays: Henry the Fifth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It, and, most remarkably, Hamlet; Elizabethans sent off an army to crush an Irish rebellion, weathered an Armada threat from Spain, gambled on a fledgling East India Company, and waited to see who would succeed their aging and childless queen.<br/>James Shapiro illuminates both Shakespeare’s staggering achievement and what Elizabethans experienced in the course of 1599, bringing together the news and the intrigue of the times with a wonderful evocation of how Shakespeare worked as an actor, businessman, and playwright. The result is an exceptionally immediate and gripping account of an inspiring moment in history.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/87/43/9780060088743.jpg", "title_long": "Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, A", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 0.97 Inches, Weight: 0.74 Pounds, Width: 5.31 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.97}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.74}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 440, "date_published": "2006-06-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Theatre', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["James Shapiro'], 'title": "Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, A", "isbn13": "9780060088743", "msrp": 1.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "0061840904", "ePub": "0061840904"}, "isbn": "0060088745", "isbn10": "0060088745", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061840906", "binding": "ebook"}]}}
