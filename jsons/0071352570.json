In 1993, Standard & Poor's, the nation's leading securities analysis firm, introduced the MidCap 400 Index and woke Wall Street up to a startling fact: Stocks of companies with mid-sized capitalization were performing better than the rest of the market. In this guide, Standard & Poor's evaluates the midcap companies in its 400 Index, one by one. It gives you full financial data, earnings reports, and S&P's highly esteemed rankings on these companies, often little-known--even by financial pros--but frequently full of potential for profitable investing.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/74/9780071352574.jpg', 'title_long': "Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Guide 2000", 'edition': '2000 ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 1.25 Inches, Width: 7.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 820, 'date_published': '2000', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Finance'], 'authors': ["Poor's, Standard & Poor's Standard"], 'title': "Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Guide 2000", 'isbn13': '9780071352574', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0071352570', 'isbn10': '0071352570'}}
