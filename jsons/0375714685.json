{"book": {"publisher": "Pantheon", "synopsis": "From one of Europe’s most important and innovative comics artists comes his greatest masterpiece—a stunning and emotionally resonant autobiography about growing up with an epileptic brother.<br/><br/>Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.<br/><br/>David B. was born Pierre-François Beauchard in a small town near Orléans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.<br/><br/>Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-François learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family’s intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-François’s grandparents and we relive his grandfathers’ experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-François through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe”s losing battle with epilepsy. Illustrated with beautiful and striking black-and-white images, Epileptic is as astonishing, intimate, and heartbreaking as the best literary memoir.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/89/9780375714689.jpg", "title_long": "Epileptic", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.73 Inches, Length: 6.52 Inches, Weight: 1.3375 Pounds, Width: 1.03 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.52}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.03}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.3375}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.73}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2006-07-04", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Biographies & History', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diseases & Physical Ailments', 'Epilepsy', 'Nervous System', 'Children's Health', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['David B.'], 'title": "Epileptic", "isbn13": "9780375714689", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375714685", "isbn10": "0375714685"}}
