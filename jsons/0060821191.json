{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': 'Andrea Davis Pinkney and Brian Pinkney present a poignant, blues-infused tribute to the men and women of the Montgomery bus boycott, who refused to give up until they got justice. "Color and movement are vibrant components in this extraordinary book about Rosa Parks\'s efforts to take down Jim Crow." (School Library Journal starred review)<br/>Rosa Parks took a stand by keeping her seat on the bus. When she was arrested for it, her supporters protested by refusing to ride. Soon a community of thousands was coming together to help one another get where they needed to go. Some started taxis, some rode bikes, but they all walked and walked.<br/>With dogged feet. With dog-tired feet. With boycott feet. With boycott blues.<br/>And, after 382 days of walking, they walked Jim Crow right out of town. . . .<br/>This story begins with shoes.<br/>This story is all for true.<br/>This story walks. And walks. And walks.<br/>To the blues.<br/><br/>"The moving poetry and the art, with thick, swirling ink lines on bright washes in red, blue, purple, and green, express the dramatic confrontations and the inspiring history. Great for reading aloud."
