{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'The final and largest volume to complete this four-volume treatise is published in response to the intense commercial and research interest in Fourier Transform Interferometry.Presenting current information from leading experts in the field, Volume 4 introduces new information on, for example,  applications of Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy in the Far-Infrared Region.  The editors place emphasis on surface studies and address advances in Capillary Gas Chromatography - Fourier Transform Interferometry.Volume 4 especially benefits spectroscopists and physicists, as well as researchers in physical, analytical, and surface chemistry.FROM THE PREFACE: Several reasons can be cited for the need to publish Volume 4 in this treatise.First, interest in Fourier transform interferometry (FT-IR) has continued.  The number of commercial manufacturers of FT-IR instrumentation has increased, reflecting the increase in demand for such instrumentation.  The main thrust in FT-IR instrumentation has focused on applications, and many techniques using FT-IR instrumentation have been generated in order to solve problems heretofore unsolvable.  The interest in surfaces relative to catalysts, polymers, and electrical conductors has escalated.  Three chapters in Volume 4 are devoted to surfaces.  Second, the great acceptance of Volumes 1 through 3 and the demand to continue the treatise have induced us to publish Volume 4.The present volume contains nine chapters, making it the largest of the four volumes.  Chapter 1 deals with infrared data processing techniques.  Chapter 2 concerns itself with circular dichroism*b1FT-IR.  Chapter 3 presents an update on GC*b1FT-IR, a rapidly moving field.  Chapter 4 deals with the combination of FT-IR and thermal analysis.  Advances in coal analyses using FT-IR are presented in Chapter 5.  Reflectance studies are highlighted in Chapters 6, 7, and 8.  Chapter 6 deals with structural characterizations made with Langmuir*b1Blodgett monolayers.  Also in Chapter 6, the extension of DRIFT into the far-infrared region is shown to be feasible and valuable.  Reflection*b1absorption surface studies (FT-IRRAS) are discussed in Chapter 8.  Chapter 9 updates us on photoacoustic spectroscopy*b1FT-IR.All of the contributions are made by working experts in these areas.  It is the hope that Volume 4 continues in the spirit of the purpose of these volumes, namely, to keep the scientific communities abreast of new developments in FT-IR as applied to chemical systems.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/25/9780122541025.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: Applications to Chemical Systems (Vol. 2)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.5070632026 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5070632026}}, 'pages': 321, 'date_published': '1979-05-12', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Chemistry', 'Analytic', 'Physics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['John R.
