Though he thinks it is empty, the daughter of the house is home. Thus begins the affair between a middle-aged Irish burglar and Beverly Penn, a young girl dying of consumption. It is a love so powerful that Peter, a simple and uneducated man, will be driven to stop time and bring back the dead.<br/>"Utterly extraordinary . . . A piercing sense of the beautiful arising from narrative and emotional fantasy is everywhere alive in the novel . . . Not for some time have I read a work as funny, thoughtful, passionate or large-souled."— New York Times Book Review", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/96/9780156031196.jpg", "title_long": "Winter"s Tale", 'edition": "First", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.762 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.3125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.762}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 768, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Magical Realism'], 'authors": ["Mark Helprin'], 'title": "Winter"s Tale", 'isbn13": "9780156031196", "msrp": 9.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0156031191", "isbn10": "0156031191", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780547543864", "binding": "saleableprint"}]}}
