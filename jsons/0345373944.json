Evocative full-color paintings and an artful abridgment of the original text capture the inimitable spirit and atmosphere of this passionate, complex, and thrilling tale.<br/>The story begins in our own time with Lestat, tall, blond, and handsome, a world-renowned rock star. His gifts are timeless, his youth never withers. But he was not always the powerful and famous child of darkness. Before his long earth-encrusted sleep, he was an aristocrat in the heady days of pre-Revolutionary France. It was then that he came face-to-face with the incarnation of evil and the temptations of love that he has ravenously pursued through time. Where it has led him and what he has become is the heart of the tale that has captured millions of readers.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/46/9780345373946.jpg", "title_long": "Anne Rice"s The Vampire Lestat: A Graphic Novel", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.65 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 1, "date_published": "1991-10-29", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor'], 'authors": ["Anne Rice'], 'title": "Anne Rice"s The Vampire Lestat: A Graphic Novel", 'isbn13": "9780345373946", "msrp": 25, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345373944", "isbn10": "0345373944"}}
