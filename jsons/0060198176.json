{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Among the Mansions of Eden is a fascinating and dishy exploration of Beverly Hills -- a rarefied community that has become a part of our country's mythos, a city renowned for its ostentatious displays of wealth. It takes you behind the gates of the rich and famous for an insider's view of the elite's rapturous and tragic attempts to realize the American Dream.<br/>From Rodeo Drive to Beverly Hills High School, Among the Mansions of Eden tells the city's story by capturing the individuals who are emblematic of various factions of Beverly Hills society: The cast of unforgettable characters includes the late Milton Berle, who spent his last days surrounded by aging cronies in the cavernous ballroom of the Friars Club, haunted by the ghosts of the past; Fred Hayman, a former banquet manager who opened a boutique called Giorgio and transformed Rodeo Drive from a provincial retail district to a phantasmagoric midway that caters to the world's most affluent shoppers; Gavin de Becker, a poor kid from a broken home who became the security broker to the stars; Mark Hughes, the health-supplement wunderkind who parlayed a trunkful of vitamin pills into a billion-dollar empire known as Herbalife and planned to build his own San Simeon on the last undeveloped mountaintop in Beverly Hills; Jim Forester, a teenager with an overriding passion for a righteous buzz that led him on a Dante-esque journey through the city's underworld of pushers, delinquents, scam artists, and sleazoids; and Norm Zadeh, who used the millions he made as a hedge-fund manager to start a girlie magazine, fill a Beverly Hills mansion with curvaceous nymphets, and emulate the life of Hugh Hefner.<br/>You'll also meet a fascinating array of con artists, hucksters, and libido-crazed pleasure seekers and gun fetishists who are willing to resort to whatever means necessary to steal a piece of the Beverly Hills Dream. Among the Mansions of Eden weaves their individual stories into a spellbinding tale of wealth, fame, and the lust for land, power, and social status in the most opulent city in America.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/76/9780060198176.jpg', 'title_long': 'Among the Mansions of Eden: Tales of Love, Lust, and Land in Beverly Hills', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.54 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.54}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2003-03-18', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture', 'Sociology', 'Urban'], 'authors': ['David Weddle'], 'title': 'Among the Mansions of Eden: Tales of Love, Lust, and Land in Beverly Hills', 'isbn13': '9780060198176', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060198176', 'isbn10': '0060198176'}}
