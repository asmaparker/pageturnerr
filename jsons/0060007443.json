{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': "Love him or hate him, you certainly can't ignore him. For the past twenty years, Australian philosopher and professor of bioethics Peter Singer has pushed the hot buttons of our collective conscience. In addition to writing the book that sparked the modern animal rights movement, Singer has challenged our most closely held beliefs on the sanctity of human life, the moral obligation's of citizens of affluent nations toward those living in the poorest countries of the world, and much more, with arguments that intrigue as often and as powerfully as they incite.<br/>Writings On An Ethical Life offers a comprehensive collection of Singer's best and most provocative writing, as chosen by Singer himself. Among the controversial subjects addressed are the moral status of animals, environmental account-ablility, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, and the ultimate choice of living an ethical life. This book provides an unsurpassed one-volume view of both the underpinnings and the applications of Singer's governing philosophy.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/47/9780060007447.jpg', 'title_long': 'Writings on an Ethical Life', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.63 Pounds, Width: 0.86 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2001-09-18', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Ethics & Morality', 'Social Philosophy'], 'authors': ['Peter Singer'], 'title': 'Writings on an Ethical Life', 'isbn13': '9780060007447', 'msrp': 9.98, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060007443', 'isbn10': '0060007443'}}
