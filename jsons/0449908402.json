From his roots as an Orthodox Jew, he took a mind-expanding tour of the teachings of Jesus, Ram Dass, Zen, Jung, the Esalen Institute, and Einstein, to name a few. In this extraordinary collection of lyrical, challenging essays, Cohen synthesizes what he has learned from these masters, and shares his journey with all of us. He discusses overcoming limitations, creating fulfilling relationships, tuning into the flow of life, transformation, finding a personal path, and the greatest gift of all, love. Read it straight through, or essay by essay, for daily meditations on the mysteries of God, love, and the spiritual path.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/02/9780449908402.jpg", "title_long": "The Dragon Doesn"t Live Here Anymore", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.23 Inches, Length: 5.13 Inches, Weight: 0.77602716224 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.13}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.9}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.77602716224}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.23}}, "pages": 397, "date_published": "1993-08-03", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Chakras', 'New Thought', 'Spiritualism', 'Occult & Paranormal', 'Parapsychology', 'Worship & Devotion', 'Inspirational'], 'authors": ["Alan Cohen'], 'title": "The Dragon Doesn"t Live Here Anymore", 'isbn13": "9780449908402", "msrp": 10.94, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0449908402", "isbn10": "0449908402"}}
