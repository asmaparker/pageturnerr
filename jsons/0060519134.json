It doesn’t get any better than this.” — Susan Elizabeth Phillips<br/>From New York Times bestselling author Mary Kay Andrews, a wittily seductive tale of divorce, revenge, and great antiques, set in sultry Savannah, Georgia.<br/>If you think you know Savannah, think again . . .<br/>Landing a catch like Talmadge Evans III encouraged Eloise “Weezie” Foley to buy a gem of a townhouse in Savannah"s historic district. Divorcing Tal got her exiled to the backyard carriage house, where she’s launched a spite-fest with Tal"s new fiancé, the elegant Caroline DeSantos.<br/>An antiques picker, Weezie combs Savannah"s steamy back alleys and garage sales for treasures when she's not dealing with her loopy relatives or her hunky ex-boyfriend. But an unauthorized sneak preview at a sale lands Weezie smack in the middle of magnolia-scented murder, mayhem . . . and more. Dirty deals simmer all around her, just as her relationship with the hottest chef in town heats up and she finds out how delicious love can be the second time around.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/91/31/9780060519131.jpg", "title_long": "Savannah Blues: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.74 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.94}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.74}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "2012-07-10", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Women's Fiction', 'Divorce', 'Friendship', 'Mothers & Children', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Southern', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Mary Kay Andrews'], 'title": "Savannah Blues: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780060519131", "msrp": 16.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "006182738X", "ePub": "006182738X"}, "isbn": "0060519134", "isbn10": "0060519134", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061827389", "binding": "print"}]}}
