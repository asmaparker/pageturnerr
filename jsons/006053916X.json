Schama’s gift for plunging us into the very center of the action makes reading an exhilarating and often moving experience.”―Daily Telegraph<br/><br/>If you were black in America at the start of the Revolutionary War, whom would you want to win?

Originally designed to break the plantations of the American South, this military strategy instead unleashed one of the great exoduses in American history.<br/>Told in the voices of the slaves and the white abolitionists who aided them, Simon Schama vividly details the odyssey of these escaped blacks, shedding light on an extraordinary chapter in America’s birth.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/91/60/9780060539160.jpg", "title_long": "Rough Crossings: Britain, The Slaves and the American Revolution", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.785 Pounds, Width: 1.52 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.52}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.785}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 496, "date_published": "2006", "subjects": ["History', 'Africa', 'West Africa', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Europe', 'Great Britain'], 'authors": ['Simon Schama'], 'title": "Rough Crossings: Britain, The Slaves and the American Revolution", "isbn13": "9780060539160", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "006053916X", "isbn10": "006053916X"}}
