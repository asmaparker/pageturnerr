{'book': {'publisher': 'Springer', 'synopsis': 'When I was Dickinson Miller\'s assistant from 1940 to 1942, I soon realized that I had encountered an unusually powerful, acute, and original mind and a writer whose clear but vivid style matched the high quality of his intelligence. These traits were apparent in his comments about eminent philosophers with whom he had associated - particularly William James but also Santayana, Dewey, Husserl, and Wittgenstein - and in the mutual criticism he demanded of his writing and my first efforts. I was pleased and felt immensely privileged to share in his planning of a book devoted to "analysis, the method of philosophy at work" as in his articles on the knowledge-problem, induction, and free will. In view of the penetration of his articles, such a book seemed long overdue as James had insisted even in 1905. When Miller\'s projected book on "analysis at work" did not appear by 1956, I consulted him about putting together a collection of his published essays. Such a collection seemed but slight homage to one who had made such a striking contribution to American philosophy in rela tion to James and one from whom I had learned so much. He felt, however, that such a collection would be inappropriate and preferred to concentrate on a book, never finished, on "the principles of practical intelligence", the application of intelligence in a "morality of results" for human welfare.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/62/9789027705662.jpg', 'title_long': 'Philosophical Analysis and Human Welfare: Selected Essays and Chapters from Six Decades (Philosophical Studies Series, 3)', 'edition': '1975', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0 Inches, Length: 0 Inches, Weight: 1.543235834 Pounds, Width: 0 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.543235834}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}}, 'pages': 343, 'date_published': '1975-05-31', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Modern', 'Movements', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Dickinson S.
