{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': "What's the secret to a company's continued growth and prosperity? Internationally known marketing expert Al Ries has the answer: focus. His commonsense approach to business management is founded on the premise that long-lasting success depends on focusing on core products and eschewing the temptation to diversify into unrelated enterprises.<br/>Using real-world examples, Ries shows that in industry after industry, it is the companies that resist diversification, and focus instead on owning a category in consumers' minds, that dominate their markets. He offers solid guidance on how to get focused and how to stay focused, laying out a workable blueprint for any company's evolution that will increase market share and shareholder value while ensuring future success.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/08/9780060799908.jpg', 'title_long': 'Focus: The Future of Your Company Depends on It', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.73}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2005-09-27', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Management', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Marketing'], 'authors': ['Al Ries'], 'title': 'Focus: The Future of Your Company Depends on It', 'isbn13': '9780060799908', 'msrp': 6.28, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060799900', 'isbn10': '0060799900'}}
