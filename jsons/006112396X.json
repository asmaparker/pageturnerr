{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon Books', 'synopsis': "Christmas in the charming seaside village of Molena Point, California, has always been a traditional affair—but not this holiday season. Instead of singing carols and climbing into Christmas trees, Joe Grey, feline P.I., is faced with his most difficult case yet—and that's saying a lot for a wily tomcat who for years has been solving crimes the police can't even crack.<br/>A stranger lies dead beneath the village Christmas tree, with a little child the only witness to the shooting. As the police scramble for leads, the grey tomcat, his tabby lady, Dulcie, and their tortoiseshell pal, Kit, launch their own unique investigation. As they care for the child who may be the shooter's next target, the cats realize they're facing their most heartbreaking case yet—and that they must catch a cunning killer if they have any hope of saving Christmas.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/62/9780061123962.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cat Deck The Halls: A Joe Grey Mystery (Joe Grey Mysteries)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.39903669422 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.39903669422}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2008', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths'], 'authors': ['Shirley Rousseau Murphy'], 'title': 'Cat Deck The Halls: A Joe Grey Mystery (Joe Grey Mysteries)', 'isbn13': '9780061123962', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061740144'}, 'isbn': '006112396X', 'isbn10': '006112396X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061740145', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
