{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'The heat is on in Palm Beach-and Rick and Samantha are sizzling.<br/>Samantha Jellicoe is no ordinary thief. At least, not anymore. She promised her significant other, British billionaire Rick Addison, that she\'d retire from her life of crime. So no more midnight break-ins . . . no more scaling estate walls . . . no more dangling from the ceiling. From here on in, it\'s intimate dinners with Rick in posh Palm Beach followed by rock-your-world sex.<br/>Who\'d have thought that doing the right thing would turn out to be more deadly than her former life of crime? When the first client of her new security business is murdered, Sam is determined to find the killer. Now if only she can manage to stay out of jail, resist her former "associate\'s" lucrative job offers, and keep Rick from sticking his nose into her business, she might just manage to stay alive. Because trouble isn\'t just walking—it\'s running—to catch up with her.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/43/9780060593643.jpg', 'title_long': "Don't Look Down", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-12-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Billionaires', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Suzanne Enoch'], 'title': "Don't Look Down", 'isbn13': '9780060593643', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061743445'}, 'isbn': '0060593644', 'isbn10': '0060593644', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061743443', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
