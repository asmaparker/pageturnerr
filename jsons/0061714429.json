{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "In this warm and wise book, Alexandra Stoddard not only celebrates what mothers know—and what we would like them to know—she encourages them to attend to their own happiness in the quest to become better mothers. Raising a good child to become a good person begins with a mother's own inner transformation. Don't think if you are a good mother you will automatically be happy, she cautions. Be happy and you will be good at everything that is meaningful and valuable in your life! From giving practical advice, to taking a more philosophical approach, to offering a comforting pat on the back, Stoddard reaches out to mothers with words that will encourage, support, and cheer them on.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/29/9780061714429.jpg', 'title_long': 'Things Good Mothers Know: A Celebration', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.93916923612 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.93916923612}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2009-02-10', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Creativity', 'Happiness', 'Personal Transformation', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Motherhood', 'Parenting'], 'authors': ['Alexandra Stoddard'], 'title': 'Things Good Mothers Know: A Celebration', 'isbn13': '9780061714429', 'msrp': 21.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061974919'}, 'isbn': '0061714429', 'isbn10': '0061714429', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061974915', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
