{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Today is Monday. The calls do not come as before. Weeks elapse between them, and when I answer the phone there is no overlap of voices, only my mother\'s. She spends much of the conversation avoiding mention of the pink elephant trumpeting in the middle of the room.<br/>The pink elephant would be my defection to Georgia.

Her best friend begs her to come back home, and Natalie keeps thinking she sees her former lover everywhere.<br/>But Natalie\'s not completely alone. There are a garden-obsessed neighbor, a former beauty queen–turned–defense attorney, and a handsome colleague who has a nervous tic whenever she gets near.
