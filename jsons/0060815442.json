{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Go back to prom and watch bumbling, lovable Iley Gilbert try to get it right this time around in Eugénie Olson's endearing story of love, bad behavior, and sequins.<br/>At age 30, Iley Gilbert is thoroughly sick of trying to make it in the photo biz, and disenchanted after putting in stints at a Boston–area newspaper, a photography gallery, and even a pathetic frame shop. When she abruptly quits the frame shop, she's ready to give up for good, until she spots a compelling ad in the paper. A photographer who shoots high school prom photos is looking for an assistant. Not only that, he's willing to pay top dollar to someone who would give up Friday and Saturday nights to help take pre–prom pictures of high–school kids dressed in their finery and candid shots during the dance.<br/>William Jasper, Prom Photographer, is not the brand of aging, greasy wedding photographer she was expecting. Rather, he's 35, strikingly handsome, and sharp–witted. Iley is instantly attracted to him and gets the sense the feeling is mutual. But William isn't everything he's made himself out to be–that is, he's not single. He's got a permanently out–of–town wife–he doesn't need a girlfriend. But Iley has lost her way, and she'll need her friends and her photos and a lot of bad proms before she can find her way back on track, away from the sleezeball, and into a life that's a little more picture–perfect.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/48/9780060815448.jpg', 'title_long': 'Love in the Time of Taffeta', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.53 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.53}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 297, 'date_published': '2006-03-28', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Doctors & Medicine', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Medical', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Romance', 'Clean & Wholesome'], 'authors': ['Eugenie Olson'], 'title': 'Love in the Time of Taffeta', 'isbn13': '9780060815448', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061985252'}, 'isbn': '0060815442', 'isbn10': '0060815442', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061985256', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
