{"book": {"publisher": "Berkley", "synopsis": "“The novel that foreshadowed Donald Trump’s authoritarian appeal.”—Salon<br/><br/>It Can’t Happen Here is the only one of Sinclair Lewis’s later novels to match the power of Main Street, Babbitt, and Arrowsmith. A cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America.<br/><br/>Written during the Great Depression, when the country was largely oblivious to Hitler’s aggression, it juxtaposes sharp political satire with the chillingly realistic rise of a president who becomes a dictator to save the nation from welfare cheats, sex, crime, and a liberal press.<br/><br/>Called “a message to thinking Americans” by the Springfield Republican when it was published in 1935, It Can’t Happen Here is a shockingly prescient novel that remains as fresh and contemporary as today’s news.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/88/9780451216588.jpg", "title_long": "It Can"t Happen Here", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.87}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.66}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.97}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Sinclair Lewis'], 'title": "It Can"t Happen Here", 'isbn13": "9780451216588", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "045121658X", "isbn10": "045121658X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780698152700", "binding": "print"}]}}
