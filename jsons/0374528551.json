{"book": {"publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "synopsis": "Selected verse from the poet who "expanded the scope of lyric poetry" (Rafael Campo, The Washington Post).<br/><br/>The work of Federico García Lorca, Spain\"s greatest modernist poet, has long been admired for its emotional intensity and metaphorical brilliance. The revised Selected Verse, which incorporates changes made to García Lorca\'s Collected Poems, is an essential addition to any poetry lover\'s bookshelf. In this bilingual edition, García Lorca\'s poetic range comes clearly into view, from the playful Suites and stylized evocations of Andalusia to the utter gravity and mystery of the final elegies, confirming his stature as one of the twentieth century\'s finest poets.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/53/9780374528553.jpg", "title_long": "Selected Verse: Revised Bilingual Edition", "edition": "Revised Bilingual", "dimensions": "Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 6.15 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.2}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2004-06-09", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Federico García Lorca'], 'title": "Selected Verse: Revised Bilingual Edition", "isbn13": "9780374528553", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0374528551", "isbn10": "0374528551", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781466898677", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
