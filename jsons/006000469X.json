{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Love is in the air -- but alas, so is murder -- as award-winning author Carolyn Hart returns once again to the South Carolina Low Country island of Broward's Rock and sets her delightful married sleuths, the Darlings, on separate trails to a killer.<br/>Nothing warms the heart like romance -- even as the raw, cold winds of January chill the residents of Broward's Rock to the bone. But it's more than amore that intrigues mystery bookstore owner Annie Darling and her husband, Max, when wealthy, widowed art patron Virginia Neville announces her engagement to Jake O'Neill, her handsome, charming, and much younger fianc√©, at a gala opening at the Neville gallery. Virginia's joyful announcement leaves many of the gathered -- especially certain members of her resentful extended stepfamily -- quite peeved. And one of the guests takes the news harder than the rest: before the last champagne bubble pops, murder disrupts the grand celebration.<br/>Quickly deputized by Acting Police Chief Billy Cameron, troubleshooter Max Darling dives headfirst into the icy investigative waters, leaving wife Annie somewhat out in the cold. But since her young assistant, Chloe, is a prime suspect -- and one of Jake O'Neill's most recent broken hearts -- Annie is determined to untangle the unholy marriage of jealousy, blackmail, gunplay, and malicious mischief ... even if it means crossing swords with hubby Max and placing herself in the perilous path of a cleverly sadistic stalker.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/99/9780060004699.jpg', 'title_long': 'Engaged to Die (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 14)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.05}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2003-03-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense'], 'authors': ['Carolyn Hart'], 'title': 'Engaged to Die (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 14)', 'isbn13': '9780060004699', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '006000469X', 'isbn10': '006000469X'}}
