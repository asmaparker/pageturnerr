{'book': {'publisher': 'Katherine Tegen Books', 'synopsis': "March 1945<br/>World War II may be ending, but for nineteen-year-old pilot Henry Forester the conflict still rages. Shot down behind enemy lines in France, Henry endured a dangerous trek to freedom, relying on the heroism of civilians and Resistance fighters to stay alive. But back home in Virginia, Henry is still reliving air battles with Hitler's Luftwaffe and his torture by the Gestapo. Mostly, Henry can't stop worrying about the safety of those who helped him escape—especially one French boy, Pierre, who, because of Henry, may have lost everything.<br/>When Henry returns to France to find Pierre, he is stunned by the brutal after-math of combat: starvation, cities shattered by Allied bombing, and the shocking return of concentration camp survivors. Amid the rubble of war, Henry must begin a daring search for a lost boy—plus a fight to regain his own internal peace and the trust of the girl he loves.<br/>L. M. Elliott's sequel to Under a War-Torn Sky is an astonishing account of surviving the fallout from war.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/74/9780060744274.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Troubled Peace (Under A War-Torn Sky, 2)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.54 Inches, Length: 5.86 Inches, Weight: 0.8708259349 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.86}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8708259349}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.54}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2009-08-25', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Historical Fiction', 'Military'], 'authors': ['L.
