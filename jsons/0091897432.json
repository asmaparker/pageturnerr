{'book': {'publisher': 'Ebury Press', 'synopsis': "Tick Bite Fever is the unconventional memoir of a very unconventional childhood. In the early Seventies, Dave Bennun's family transplanted themselves from Swindon to the wilds of Kenya. His father had lived in Africa before, but for Dave, Kenya was bemusingly new. It would be his home for the next 16 years, with things sometimes seeming a bit surreal. On the way home from school—closed early because a pair of lions were padding around the playground—Dave was mugged by baboons. Some Sunday afternoons saw Dave and his father being chased by a herd of elephants. Enchantingly funny, Tick Bite Fever is a tale of the fading innocence of childhood that is miles ahead of the competition.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/37/9780091897437.jpg', 'title_long': 'Tick Bite Fever', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.8 Inches, Length: 4.8 Inches, Weight: 0.48281235378 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.9}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48281235378}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.8}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2004-08-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors': ['David Bennun'], 'title': 'Tick Bite Fever', 'isbn13': '9780091897437', 'msrp': 27.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0091897432', 'isbn10': '0091897432'}}
