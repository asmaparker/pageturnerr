By twenty-four, he had been sentenced to nineteen and a half years in prison on federal drug trafficking charges. It was an all-too-familiar story for a young man raised on the streets of South Central LA. But what happened next wasn't.<br/>Once inside prison, Jeff Henderson worked his way up from dishwasher to chief prison cook, and when he was released in 1996, he had found his passion and his dreamâ€”he would become a professional chef. Barely five years out of federal prison, he was on his way to becoming an executive chef, as well as being a sought-after public speaker on human potential and a dedicated mentor to at-risk youth. A window into the streets and the fast-paced kitchens of world-renowned restaurants, Cooked is a very human story with a powerful message of commitment, redemption, and change.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/14/9780061153914.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cooked: My Journey from the Streets to the Stove', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.57 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.57}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2008-02-26', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Culinary', 'Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Cooking Education & Reference', 'Essays', 'Comfort Food', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jeff Henderson'], 'title': 'Cooked: My Journey from the Streets to the Stove', 'isbn13': '9780061153914', 'msrp': 11.98, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061736910'}, 'isbn': '0061153915', 'isbn10': '0061153915', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061736919', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
