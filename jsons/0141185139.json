{"book": {"publisher": "PENGUIN MODERN CLASSIC", "synopsis": "The Plague is Albert Camus"s world-renowned fable of fear and courage The townspeople of Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying death. Fear, isolation and claustrophobia follow as they are forced into quarantine. Each person responds in their own way to the lethal disease: some resign themselves to fate, some seek blame, and a few, like Dr Rieux, resist the terror. An immediate triumph when it was published in 1947, The Plague is in part an allegory of France"s suffering under the Nazi occupation, and a story of bravery and determination against the precariousness of human existence.
