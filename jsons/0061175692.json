{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Keenan James has made a career out of teaching women what men really want. He hosts a weekly roundtable, where he offers advice to the love-lorn, and now he's even been tapped to write a book—though he's never been able to commit to just one girl. Unfortunately, he's recently been saddled with his mom's irrepressible pooch, a golden doodle named Barbra Streisand, and his publisher has saddled him with a co-writer—a shy psychologist named Tory Hoffstra, who's determined to keep him on a short leash.<br/>Suspecting that Keenan's nothing but a hound, Tory joins the round-table under an alias. She's shocked that he's more than just a smooth-talking seducer . . . and that he's even more gorgeous than she had heard. As for Keenan, before long he finds himself warming up to Barbra the dog and feeling the heat with Tory . . . and learning that not even his own advice could have prepared him for finally falling in love.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/95/9780061175695.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hello, Doggy!', 'edition': 'English Language', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2007-12-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Paranormal', 'Historical', 'Ancient World', 'Victorian', 'Fantasy', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Elaine Fox'], 'title': 'Hello, Doggy!', 'isbn13': '9780061175695', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061746657'}, 'isbn': '0061175692', 'isbn10': '0061175692', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061746659', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
