After escaping from the dark and dismal workhouse where he was born, Oliver finds himself on the mean streets of Victorian-era London and is unwittingly recruited into a scabrous gang of scheming urchins. In this band of petty thieves Oliver encounters the extraordinary and vibrant characters who have captured readers’ imaginations for more than 150 years: the loathsome Fagin, the beautiful and tragic Nancy, the crafty Artful Dodger, and perhaps one of the greatest villains of all time―the terrifying Bill Sikes.&&LBR&&R&&LBR&&RRife with Dickens’s disturbing descriptions of street life, the novel is buoyed by the purity of the orphan Oliver.
