{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "Lydia Kilkenny is eager to move beyond her South Boston childhood, and when she marries Henry Wickett, a shy Boston Brahmin who plans to become a doctor, her future seems assured. That path changes when Henry abandons his medical studies and enlists Lydia to help him invent a mail-order medicine called Wickett’s Remedy. Then the 1918 influenza epidemic sweeps through Boston, and in a world turned upside down Lydia must forge her own path through the tragedy unfolding around her. As she secures work as a nurse at a curious island medical station conducting human research into the disease, Henry’s former business partner steals the formula for Wickett’s Remedy to create for himself a new future, trying—and almost succeeding—to erase the past he is leaving behind.<br/><br/>Alive with narrative ingenuity, and tinged with humor as well as sorrow, this inspired recreation of a forgotten era powerfully reminds us how much individual voices matter—in history and in life.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/27/9781400078127.jpg", "title_long": "Wickett"s Remedy: A Novel", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.675 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.14}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.83}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.675}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2006-10-10", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Myla Goldberg'], 'title": "Wickett"s Remedy: A Novel", 'isbn13": "9781400078127", "msrp": 14, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307493172"}, "isbn": "1400078121", "isbn10": "1400078121", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307493170", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
