{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "A celebration of the character and style of one of the world's most spectacular cities! This vibrant insider's view of the most mature city on earth is the perfect companion for anyone who loves anything Italian. In 1995, after a twenty-year love affair with Italy, Alan Epstein fulfilled his dream to live in Rome. In As the Romans Do, he celebrates the spirit of this stylish, dramatic, ancient city that formed the hub of a far-flung empire and introduced the Mediterranean culture to the rest of the world. He also reveals today's Roman men and women in all their appealing contradictions: their gregarious caffe culture; inborn artistic flair; passionate appreciation of good food; instinctive mistrust of technology; showy sex appeal; ingrained charm and expressiveness; surprisingly unusual attitudes toward marriage and religion; and much, much more.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/51/9780060933951.jpg', 'title_long': "As the Romans Do: An American Family's Italian Odyssey", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.57 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.57}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2001-06-05', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Travel', 'Europe', 'Italy', 'General', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors': ['Alan Epstein'], 'title': "As the Romans Do: An American Family's Italian Odyssey", 'isbn13': '9780060933951', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061847577'}, 'isbn': '006093395X', 'isbn10': '006093395X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061847578', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
