{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt, Rinehart and Winston', 'synopsis': 'Written in 1951 (with a second edition in 1961), this book takes its place within an impressive array of attempts to wrestle with Karl Barth\'s theology from a Catholic point of view. The book adopts the twofold strategy of presenting an exposition of "the whole of Barth\'s thought," while doing so for the purpose of a confessional dialogue among theologians. Not to be construed as an "Introduction to the Theology of Karl Barth, Balthasar\'s effort is to provide a Catholic response which, though not "official", nonetheless seeks to express a common direction and movement within Catholicism.<br/><br/>The Theology of Karl Barth shows how a rethinking of basic issues in fundamental theology\x97concerning the relation of nature and grace, philosophy and theology, the "analogy of being" and the "analogy of faith"\x97might lead to a rapprochement between the two great rivers of Christianity, without compromising the center of gravity of either. In the process the book makes a major contribution to renewed understanding of Christianity in a secularized modern world.
