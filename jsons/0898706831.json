{"book": {"publisher": "Ignatius Press", "synopsis": "It is generally agreed among his foes no less than among his friends that Ignatius of Loyola was a maker of history. A hundred books could be cited in proof of this statement, but the aim of this classic work is rather to show history and the grace of God forming the person of St. Ignatius.

Brodrick combines scholarly research with a readable, enjoyable style in a book that endeavors to show the stages by which God led the wounded cavalier out of his dream-world of romantic battles in the service of fair ladies into the noontide of divine reality.<br/>"The Pilgrimage", as he liked to call the difficult period of his spiritual apprenticeship, began when he was thirty and lasted for seventeen years of endless and often very moving trials. Out of it emerged a man completely transformed in Christ, one of the great saints in the history of the Church.
