Puzo"s classic novel, The Sicilian, stands as a cornerstone of his work—a lushly romantic, unforgettable tale of bloodshed, justice, and treachery. . . .<br/><br/>The year is 1950. Michael Corleone is nearing the end of his exile in Sicily. The Godfather has commanded Michael to bring a young Sicilian bandit named Salvatore Guiliano back with him to America. But Guiliano is a man entwined in a bloody web of violence and vendettas. In Sicily, Guiliano is a modern day Robin Hood who has defied corruption—and defied the Cosa Nostra. Now, in the land of mist-shrouded mountains and ancient ruins, Michael Corleone"s fate is entwined with the dangerous legend of Salvatore Guiliano: warrior, lover, and the ultimate Siciliano.<br/><br/>Praise for The Sicilian<br/><br/>“Puzo is a master storyteller.”—USA Today<br/><br/>“The Balzac of the mafia.”—Time<br/><br/>“An accomplished and imaginative writer.”—Los Angeles Times", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/06/9780345441706.jpg", "title_long": "The Sicilian: A Novel", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 6.85 Inches, Length: 4.21 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.21}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.04}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.43}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.85}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "2001-05-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Mario Puzo'], 'title": "The Sicilian: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780345441706", "msrp": 8.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0345480740"}, "isbn": "0345441702", "isbn10": "0345441702", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780345480743", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
