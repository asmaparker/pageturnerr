{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "This is the story of a little girl named Fern who loved a little pig named Wilburâ€”and of Wilbur's dear friend Charlotte, a beautiful large grey spider who lived with Wilbur in the barn. With the help of Templeton, the rat who never did anything for anybody unless there was something in it for him, and with a wonderfully clever plan of her own, Charlotte saved the life of Wilbur, who by this time had grown up to be quite some pig.<br/>How all of this comes about is Mr. White's story. It is a story of the magic of childhood on the farm. It is also a story of friendship, loyalty, and truth and shows readers that friends come in all shapes and sizes. The beloved story of Charlotte the spider, Wilbur the pig, and Fern, the little girl who understood their language, will continue to delight readers both young and old everywhere for generations to come.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/62/9780061127762.jpg', 'title_long': "Charlotte's Web Signature Edition", 'edition': 'First Printing - First Thus', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 2 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2006-10-31', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Farm Animals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['E.
