{"book": {"publisher": "Little, Brown and Company", "synopsis": "A powerful and moving history of Asian Americans that spans centuries, from the acclaimed author of A Different Mirror.<br/><br/>In an extraordinary blend of narrative history, personal recollection, and oral testimony, the author presents a sweeping history of Asian Americans. He writes of the Chinese who laid tracks for the transcontinental railroad, of plantation laborers in the canefields of Hawaii, of "picture brides" marrying strangers in the hope of becoming part of the American dream. He tells stories of Japanese Americans behind the barbed wire of U.S. internment camps during World War II, Hmong refugees tragically unable to adjust to Wisconsin\"s alien climate and culture, and Asian American students stigmatized by the stereotype of the 'model minority.'<br/><br/>This is a powerful and moving work that will resonate for all Americans, who together make up a nation of immigrants from other shores.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/07/9780316831307.jpg", "title_long": "Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans, Updated and Revised Edition", "edition": "Revised and Updated", "dimensions": "Height: 8.375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.17 Pounds, Width: 1.125 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.125}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.17}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.375}}, "pages": 640, "date_published": "1998-09-23", "subjects": ["History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Asia', 'China', 'Japan', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Emigration & Immigration', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Ronald Takaki'], 'title": "Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans, Updated and Revised Edition", "isbn13": "9780316831307", "msrp": 18, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0316831301", "isbn10": "0316831301", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781456611071", "binding": "e"}]}}
