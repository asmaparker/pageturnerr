But sixteen years ago Ben Tyson was a lieutenant in Vietnam.<br/><br/>There, in 1968, the men under his command committed a murderous atrocity-and together swore never to tell the world what they had done. Not the press, army justice, and the events he tried to forget have caught up with Ben Tyson. His family, his career, and his personal sense of honor hang in the balance. And only one woman can reveal the truth of his past--and set him free.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/29/9780446674829.jpg", "title_long": "Word of Honor", "edition": "17924th", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.56 Pounds, Width: 2.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.56}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 880, "date_published": "1998-09-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'War', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Legal', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Military', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Nelson DeMille'], 'title": "Word of Honor", "isbn13": "9780446674829", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0446674826", "isbn10": "0446674826"}}
