Dealing - among many other things - with friendship, love, war, three cultures and three families over three generations, one brown mouse, and the tricky way the past has of coming back and biting you on the ankle, it is a life-affirming, riotous must-read of a book. 'Funny, clever ... and a rollicking good read' Independent 'Astonishingly assured, funny and serious... I was delighted' Salman Rushdie 'Quirky, sassy and wise ... a big, splashy, populous production reminiscent of books by Dickens and Salman Rushdie ... demonstrates both an instinctive storytelling talent and a fully fashioned voice that's street-smart and learned, sassy and philosophical all at the same time' New York Times 'Smith writes like an old hand, and, sometimes, like a dream' New Yorker 'Outstanding ... A strikingly clever and funny book with a passion for ideas, for language and for the rich tragic-comedy of life' Sunday Telegraph 'Relentlessly funny ... idiosyncratic, and deeply felt' Guardian', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/63/36/9780140276336.jpg", "title_long": "White Teeth", "dimensions": "Height: 7.8 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.84437046346 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.84437046346}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.8}}, "pages": 480, "date_published": "2001-02-06", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Zadie Smith'], 'title": "White Teeth", "isbn13": "9780140276336", "msrp": 14.45, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140276335", "isbn10": "0140276335"}}
