{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "Elvin Bishop's uncle is a lot like Elvin's father. They're both dead, for instance. But Elvin's cool with that; it's the way it's been for as long as he can remember.<br/>Then one day it turns out that Uncle Alex isn't exactly dead. He is, instead, sitting on the couch, chewing a scone, and preparing to make up for lost time by fixing his sad-sack nephew before it's too late. Not long out of prison and perhaps not long for this world, Alex embarks on a crash course of tough love designed to turn Elvin into a real Bishop man.<br/>Despite his mighty powers of resistance and denial, Elvin is dragged on an odyssey that introduces him to glam tuba, hellfire-hot food, and the horrors of gym membership. Along the way he finds things he never wanted to look for -- lost relatives, history, roots, regrets, and his own wobbly brand of strength.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/92/9780060597092.jpg', 'title_long': 'Me, Dead Dad, & Alcatraz', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.85}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2005-09-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Humor', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Boys & Men', 'Humorous', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors': ['Chris Lynch'], 'title': 'Me, Dead Dad, & Alcatraz', 'isbn13': '9780060597092', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060597097', 'isbn10': '0060597097'}}
