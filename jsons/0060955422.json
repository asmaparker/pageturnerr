{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial Modern Classics", "synopsis": "“A book filled with richnesses of humor and tragedy of disappointment and triumph, of sweetness and bitterness, and all in that unsurpassed American prose.”<br/>—New York Herald Tribune Book Review<br/>Mark Twain was a figure larger than life: massive in talent, eruptive in temperament, unpredictable in his actions. He crafted stories of heroism, adventure, tragedy, and comedy that reflected the changing America of the time, and he tells his own story—which includes sixteen pages of photos—with the same flair he brought to his fiction. Writing this autobiography on his deathbed, Twain vowed to be “free and frank and unembarrassed” in the recounting of his life and his experiences.<br/>Twain was more than a match for the expanding America of riverboats, gold rushes, and the vast westward movement, which provided the material for his novels and which served to inspire this beloved and uniquely American autobiography.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/54/27/9780060955427.jpg", "title_long": "The Autobiography of Mark Twain (Perennial Classics)", "dimensions": "Height: 1.38 Inches, Length: 8.03 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 5.35 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.03}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.35}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.38}}, "pages": 560, "date_published": "2000-01-26", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Historical', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Mark Twain'], 'title": "The Autobiography of Mark Twain (Perennial Classics)", "isbn13": "9780060955427", "msrp": 15.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060955422", "isbn10": "0060955422"}}
