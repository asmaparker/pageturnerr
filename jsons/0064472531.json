{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTeen', 'synopsis': "This is the story of two girls, racing through space like shadow and light. A photo negative, together they make the perfect image of a girl. Violet is the dark one, dressed in forever black, dreaming Technicolor dreams of spinning the world into her very own silver screen creation. Claire is like a real-life Tinker Bell, radiating love and light, dressing herself in wings of gauze and glitter, writing poems to keep away the darkness. The setting is L.A., a city as beautiful as it is dangerous, and within this landscape of beauty and pain Violet and Claire vow to make their own movie. Together they will show the world the way they want it to be, and maybe then the world will become that place--a place where people no longer hate or fight or want to hurt. But when desire and ambition threaten to rip a seamless friendship apart, only one thing can make two halves whole again--the power of love.<br/>Francesca Lia Block's latest novel is a beautifully told story that boldly combines the world of film with the lyrical graceful language of poetry. The voices of two friends--one dark, one light--combine to tell a larger tale of love and loss, and the strength that comes from believing in dreams.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/31/9780064472531.jpg', 'title_long': 'Violet & Claire', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.125 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.3747858454 Pounds, Width: 0.488889 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.488889}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3747858454}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.125}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2000-10-31', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors': ['Francesca Lia Block'], 'title': 'Violet & Claire', 'isbn13': '9780064472531', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061757306'}, 'isbn': '0064472531', 'isbn10': '0064472531', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061757303', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
