{"book": {"publisher": "University of Georgia Press", "synopsis": "To Rebecca Solnit, the word "landscape" implies not only literal places, but also the ground on which we invent our lives and confront our innermost troubles and desires. The organic world, to Solnit, gives rise to the social, political, and philosophical landscapes we inhabit. As Eve Said to the Serpent skillfully weaves the natural world with the realm of art―its history, techniques, and criticism―to offer a remarkable compendium of Solnit\"s research and ruminations.<br/><br/>The nineteen pieces in this book range from the intellectual formality of traditional art criticism to highly personal, lyrical meditations. All are distinguished by Solnit\'s vivid, original style that blends imaginative associations with penetrating insights. These thoughts produce quirky, intelligent, and wryly humorous content as Solnit ranges across disciplines to explore nuclear test sites, the meaning of national borders, deserts, clouds, and caves―as well as ideas of the feminine and the sublime as they relate to our physical and psychological terrains.<br/><br/>Sixty images throughout the book display the work of the contemporary artists under discussion, including landscape photographers, performance artists, sculptors, and installation artists. Alongside her text, Solnit\'s gallery of images provides a vivid excursion into new ways of perceiving landscape, bodies, and art. Animals and the human body appear together with space and terra firma as Solnit reconfigures the blurred lines that define nature.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/37/9780820324937.jpg", "title_long": "As Eve Said to the Serpent: On Landscape, Gender, and Art", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 9.499981 Inches, Length: 7.999984 Inches, Weight: 0.73413933246 Pounds, Width: 0.55999888 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.999984}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.55999888}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.73413933246}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.499981}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2003-03-17", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism', 'Themes', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Gender Studies', 'Human Geography'], 'authors": ["Rebecca Solnit'], 'title": "As Eve Said to the Serpent: On Landscape, Gender, and Art", "isbn13": "9780820324937", "msrp": 28.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0820324930", "isbn10": "0820324930"}}
