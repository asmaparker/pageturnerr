{"book": {"publisher": "Mel Bay Publications, Inc.", "synopsis": "This encyclopedia is designed to provide mandolin players with a wide variety of chords in different voicings. This book is intended as both a starting point of learning chord voicings and patterns, as well as a dictionary of common mandolin chords. Each key section includes the first position scale for that key, as well as the chord formula and notes for each chord. If you want to learn to be a bluegrass rhythm player it helps to have a guide or "map"to take you through the initial learning stage. This book provides a small but powerful set of starter chords used in this style of music. Once these chords are learned, you\"ll be able to jam with other musicians in no time. These are the same chords used by greats like Bill Monroe, Doyle Lawson, David Grisman and hundreds of other bluegrass players in this genre. While there are only a few chords presented in the 'map' section, they form the foundation of bluegrass mandolin and with them you can play literally thousands of songs in every key. Chords are presented by key.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/72/9780786647972.jpg", "title_long": "Mel Bay Deluxe Encyclopedia Of Mandolin Chords", "dimensions": "Height: 11 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.17 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.17}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 11}}, "pages": 72, "date_published": "2015-03-20", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Instruments', 'Songbooks', 'Theory, Composition & Performance', 'Reference', 'Encyclopedias & Subject Guides'], 'authors": ["John Baxter'], 'title": "Mel Bay Deluxe Encyclopedia Of Mandolin Chords", "isbn13": "9780786647972", "msrp": 14.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0786647973", "isbn10": "0786647973"}}
