{'book': {'publisher': 'R & S Books', 'synopsis': 'Three hippos have a very exciting day. Life for the little hippos is always the same: diving and swimming to their hearts\x92 content. Except the hippos think that it would be more fun if their diving board could be higher, as high as Tall Cliff. But they\x92re not allowed to go to Tall Cliff because it\x92s too dangerous. Each day they ask if they can, and each day they are told no. Finally, one day they are allowed to go there to bathe \x96 cheers and jubilation! They are happy and hungry when they are swimming home, and they completely forget to watch out for trouble. With charming illustrations, Lena Landstr√∂m\x92s newest picture book is a hilarious romp through the jungle.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/01/9789129655001.jpg', 'title_long': "The Little Hippos' Adventure", 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 0.79 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.79}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 28, 'date_published': '2002-04-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals'], 'authors': ['Lena Landstrom', 'Joan Sandin'], 'title': "The Little Hippos' Adventure", 'isbn13': '9789129655001', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '9129655005', 'isbn10': '9129655005'}}
