Undaunted by wild animals, hunger, and bouts with tropical diseases, she tries to forge a life with Lketinga. But slowly the dream starts to crumble when she can no longer ignore the chasm between their two vastly different cultures.<br/>A story that taps into our universal belief in the power of love, The White Masai is at once a hopelessly romantic love story, a gripping adventure yarn, and a compulsively good read.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/15/23/9780061131523.jpg", "title_long": "The White Masai", "edition": "English Language", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.000625 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.05}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.000625}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2006-10-10", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Reference', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Women's Studies', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ["Corinne Hofmann'], 'title": "The White Masai", "isbn13": "9780061131523", "msrp": 24.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0061131520", "isbn10": "0061131520"}}
