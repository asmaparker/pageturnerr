Her magnificent memoir, Out of Africa, established Isak Dinesen as a major twentieth-century author, who was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize.<br/><br/>With exceptional grace, Judith Thurman\"s classic work explores Dinesen\"s life. Until the appearance of this book, the life and art of Isak Dinesen have been--as Dinesen herself wrote of two lovers in a tale-- "a pair of locked caskets, each containing the key to the other.' Judith Thurman has provided the master key to them both.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/56/9780312135256.jpg", "title_long": "Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.999988 Inches, Weight: 1.54984970186 Pounds, Width: 1.1448796 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.999988}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.1448796}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.54984970186}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 512, "date_published": "1995-10-15", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Women Authors', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Women's Studies', 'Women Writers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Judith Thurman'], 'title": "Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller", "isbn13": "9780312135256", "msrp": 26, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312135254", "isbn10": "0312135254"}}
