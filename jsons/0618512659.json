{"book": {"publisher": "Mariner Books", "synopsis": "The first ever paperback edition of J.R.R. Tolkien’s complete Father Christmas letters, including a new introduction and rare archive materials.<br/>Every December an envelope bearing a stamp from the North Pole would arrive for J.R.R.Tolkien’s children. Inside would be a letter in strange spidery handwriting and a beautiful colored drawing or some sketches. The letters were from Father Christmas.<br/>They told wonderful tales of life at the North Pole: how all the reindeer got loose and scattered presents all over the place; how the accident-prone Polar Bear climbed the North Pole and fell through the roof of Father Christmas’s house into the dining-room; how he broke the Moon into four pieces and made the Man in it fall into the back garden; how there were wars with the troublesome horde of goblins who lived in the caves beneath the house!<br/>Sometimes the Polar Bear would scrawl a note, and sometimes Ilbereth the Elf would write in his elegant flowing script, adding yet more life and humor to the stories. No reader, young or old, can fail to be charmed by the inventiveness and ‘authenticity’ of Tolkien’s Letters from Father Christmas.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/52/9780618512652.jpg", "title_long": "Letters From Father Christmas", "edition": "Revised", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.25 inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2004-11-15", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Painting', 'Watercolor', 'Children's Books', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Fairy Tales, Folk Tales & Myths', 'Anthologies', 'Humor', 'Holidays & Celebrations', 'Christmas', 'Genre Fiction', 'Friendship', 'Themes & Styles', 'Mythology & Folk Tales', 'Folklore', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Humorous', 'Dragons & Mythical Creatures', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["J.R.R.
