{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "Like an elegantly chilling postscript to The Metamorphosis, this classic of postwar Japanese literature describes a bizarre physical transformation that exposes the duplicities of an entire world. The narrator is a scientist hideously deformed in a laboratory accident–a man who has lost his face and, with it, his connection to other people. Even his wife is now repulsed by him.<br/><br/>His only entry back into the world is to create a mask so perfect as to be undetectable. But soon he finds that such a mask is more than a disguise: it is an alternate self–a self that is capable of anything. A remorseless meditation on nature, identity and the social contract,The Face of Another is an intellectual horror story of the highest order.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/38/9780375726538.jpg", "title_long": "The Face of Another", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.89 Inches, Length: 5.21 Inches, Weight: 0.44 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.21}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.58}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.89}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2003-02-04", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Magical Realism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Kobo Abe'], 'title": "The Face of Another", "isbn13": "9780375726538", "msrp": 14.55, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "030781372X", "ePub": "030781372X"}, "isbn": "0375726535", "isbn10": "0375726535", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307813725", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
