{"book": {"publisher": "Atlantic Monthly Press", "synopsis": "Cold Mountain is an extraordinary novel about a soldier’s perilous journey back to his beloved at the end of the Civil War. At once a magnificent love story and a harrowing account of one man’s long walk home, Cold Mountain introduces a stunning new talent in American literature.<br/><br/>Based on local history and family stories passed down by the author’s great-great-grandfather, Cold Mountain is the tale of a wounded soldier, Inman, who walks away from the ravages of the war and back home to his prewar sweetheart, Ada. Inman’s odyssey through the devastated landscape of the soon-to-be-defeated South interweaves with Ada’s struggle to revive her father’s farm, with the help of an intrepid young drifter named Ruby. As their long-separated lives begin to converge at the close of the war, Inman and Ada confront the vastly transformed world they’ve been delivered.<br/><br/>Charles Frazier reveals marked insight into man’s relationship to the land and the dangers of solitude. He also shares with the great nineteenth century novelists a keen observation of a society undergoing change. Cold Mountain re-creates a world gone by that speaks eloquently to our time.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/94/9780871136794.jpg", "title_long": "Cold Mountain", "edition": "1st", "dimensions": "Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.42418621252 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.42418621252}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.75}}, "pages": 356, "date_published": "1997-05-16", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'War', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Charles Frazier'], 'title": "Cold Mountain", "isbn13": "9780871136794", "msrp": 19.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0871136791", "isbn10": "0871136791"}}
