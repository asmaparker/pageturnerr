This principle sets his plays apart from the rest, steering them clear of melodrama, and draws the audience into the lives of Chekhov’s colorful characters. Because of his adherence to realism, the playwright has been called an “incomparable artist of life.”*<br/><br/>“What makes his work great is that it can be felt and understood not only by any Russian but by anybody in the world.”—*Leo Tolstoy<br/><br/>With a Foreword by Robert Brustein and an Afterword by Rosamund Bartlett", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/70/9780451530370.jpg", "title_long": "The Major Plays (Signet Classics)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.77 Inches, Length: 4.22 Inches, Weight: 0.4629707502 Pounds, Width: 1.07 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.22}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.07}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4629707502}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.77}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2006-12-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Anton Chekhov'], 'title": "The Major Plays (Signet Classics)", "isbn13": "9780451530370", "msrp": 1.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101568127"}, "isbn": "0451530373", "isbn10": "0451530373", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101568125", "binding": "print"}]}}
