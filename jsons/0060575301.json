She has earned the grudging respect of her fellow novices and a place in the Magicians\' Guild. But there is much she wishes she had never learned—what she witnessed, for example, in the underground chamber of the mysterious High Lord Akkarin . . . and the knowledge that the Guild is being observed closely by an ancient fearsome enemy.<br/>Still, she dares not ignore the terrifying truths the High Lord would share with her, even though she fears it may be base trickery, a scheme to use her astonishing powers to accomplish his dark aims. For Sonea knows her future is in his hands—and that only in the shadows will she achieve true greatness . . . if she survives.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/04/9780060575304.jpg', 'title_long': 'The High Lord (The Black Magician Trilogy, Book 3) (Black Magician Trilogy, 3)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.57 Pounds, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.57}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 531, 'date_published': '2004-08-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Coming of Age', 'Myths & Legends', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure'], 'authors': ['Trudi Canavan'], 'title': 'The High Lord (The Black Magician Trilogy, Book 3) (Black Magician Trilogy, 3)', 'isbn13': '9780060575304', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061798193', 'ePub': '0061798193'}, 'isbn': '0060575301', 'isbn10': '0060575301', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061798191', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
