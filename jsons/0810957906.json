{"book": {"publisher": ""Harry N. Abrams, Inc."", 'synopsis": "From the bodice-busting covers of Harlequin romances to personal ads to wedding cake toppers, romantic subjects have thrived in the fertile soil of American modern-age media and pop culture. Brought to Abrams by the creators of the successful Happy Kitty Bunny Pony: A Saccharine Mouthful of Super Cute, Love Sick celebrates the many facets of love: dating, marriage, heartbreak, sex, and strange, thin men in shorts with funny socks!<br/><br/>Containing more than 200 images from the print and advertising archives of Charles S. Anderson Design Company in combination with a sharply hilarious text by Michael J. Nelson, the main writer and host of the legendary Mystery Science Theater 3000, Love Sick is a steamy, kitsch, and campy testament to America"s love of LOVE. So grab a cozy spot by the fire, snuggle up with the one you love, and see if either of you recognizes yourself in Love Sick.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/09/9780810957909.jpg", "title_long": "Love Sick: A Smoldering Look at Love, Lust, and Marriage", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.2}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "2005-09-01", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Pop Culture', 'Art', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture'], 'authors": ["Michael J.
