In New York, oldest sister Sabrina is an ambitious young lawyer, while Annie is an American artist in Florence, living for her art. . . . On one Fourth of July weekend, as they do every year, the four sisters come home to Connecticut for their family’s annual gathering. But before the holiday is over, tragedy strikes and their world is utterly changed.<br/><br/>Suddenly, four sisters who have been fervently pursuing success and their own lives—on opposite sides of the world—reunite to share one New York brownstone, to support each other and their father, and to pick up the pieces while one sister struggles to heal her shattered body and soul. Thus begins an unscripted chapter of their lives, as a bustling house is soon filled with eccentric dogs, laughter, tears, friends, men . . . and the kind of honesty and unconditional love only sisters can provide. But as the four women settle in, they are forced to confront the direction of their respective lives. As the year passes and another July Fourth approaches, a season of grief and change gives way to new beginnings—as a family comes together to share its blessings and a future filled with surprises and, ultimately, hope.<br/><br/>With unerring insight and compassion, Danielle Steel tells a compelling story of four sisters who love and laugh, struggle and triumph . . . and are irrevocably woven into the fabric of each other’s lives. Brilliantly blending humor and heartbreak, she delivers a powerful message about the fragility—and the wonder—of life.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/29/9780385340229.jpg", "title_long": "Sisters", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.5 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.5}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2007-02-14", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Women's Fiction', 'Sisters', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Danielle Steel'], 'title": "Sisters", "isbn13": "9780385340229", "msrp": 27, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307566838", "ePub": "0307566838"}, "isbn": "0385340222", "isbn10": "0385340222", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307566836", "binding": "saleableprint"}]}}
