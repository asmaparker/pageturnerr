{'book': {'publisher': 'Saunders College Pub', 'synopsis': "A friendly tone and straightforward style characterize this unique text that serves as a basis for a course in preparatory physics, ensuring greater success when students take the subsequent calculus-based physics course. It also is useful as a study supplement that strengthens students' understanding of a calculus-based physics. Mathematical concepts are explained and integrated with formulas to increase student understanding. Coverage includes content material normally presented in worked and a review of techniques learned in class for students who need additional material on calculus-based physics. Topics such as order of magnitude and vectors are presented throughout the text to reinforce major physical concepts. Each concept is developed carefully, with many graphs, pictures, and examples that appeal to students' intuition.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/08/9780030960208.jpg', 'title_long': 'So You Want to Take Physics: A Preparatory Course (Saunders Golden Sunburst Series)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 1.5211896078 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.5211896078}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 340, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Rodney Cole'], 'title': 'So You Want to Take Physics: A Preparatory Course (Saunders Golden Sunburst Series)', 'isbn13': '9780030960208', 'msrp': 61.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0030960207', 'isbn10': '0030960207'}}
