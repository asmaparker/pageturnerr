{"book": {"publisher": "Little, Brown Book Group", "synopsis": "In the Morland Dynasty series, the majestic sweep of English history is richly and movingly portrayed through the fictional lives of the Morland family. It is 1772, and England is peaceful under George III, and Morland Place flourishes under the careful tending of Jemima and her loyal husband Allen. Their seven children often bring them heartache, but they are sustained by their love for each other and their absorbing interest in improving the estate lands. But beyond England’s shores things are not so calm. Morland cousins find themselves embroiled in the American war for independence, and the family’s bastard offshoot, Henri, disports himself in the salons of Paris while outside revolution creeps closer.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/64/9780751506464.jpg", "title_long": "The Flood-Tide (Morland Dynasty)", "edition": "New edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.5732018812 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5732018812}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 428, "date_published": "1986-02-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Cynthia Harrod-Eagles'], 'title": "The Flood-Tide (Morland Dynasty)", "isbn13": "9780751506464", "msrp": 12.79, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0748132961"}, "isbn": "075150646X", "isbn10": "075150646X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780748132966", "binding": "print"}]}}
