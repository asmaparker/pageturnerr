{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "Chloe Morgan is a thirty-three-year-old part-time waitress, small-time horse trainer, and full-time thoroughly toughened Western woman living in a corner of the dwindling canyonlands of Southern California. Calloused and wary, Chloe allows herself to love with total abandon and complete faith only her horse and her dog. That is, until a quirk in the weather and a sunrise funeral service cause her to cross the path of Henry Oliver, a sedate professor of folklore at the local college, who, like Chloe, has his reasons for holding back. But once Hank steps inside Chloe's makeshift cabin in the hills, Chloe realizes she must come to terms with her losses and decide between the life of solitude she had always thought was her fate and the love of a man who seems—at first—all wrong.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/45/9780060924645.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hank & Chloe', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.8 Inches, Length: 8.02 Inches, Weight: 0.6393405598 Pounds, Width: 5.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.02}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6393405598}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}}, 'pages': 324, 'date_published': '1994-04-08', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jo-Ann Mapson'], 'title': 'Hank & Chloe', 'isbn13': '9780060924645', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061744840'}, 'isbn': '0060924640', 'isbn10': '0060924640', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061744846', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
