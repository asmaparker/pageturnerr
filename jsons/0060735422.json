{"book": {"publisher": "William Morrow Paperbacks", "synopsis": "In Christopher Moore\"s ingenious debut novel, we meet one of the most memorably mismatched pairs in the annals of literature. The good-looking one is one-hundred-year-old ex-seminarian and "roads" scholar Travis O\'Hearn. The green one is Catch, a demon with a nasty habit of eating most of the people he meets. Behind the fake Tudor facade of Pine Cove, California, Catch sees a four-star buffet. Travis, on the other hand, thinks he sees a way of ridding himself of his toothy traveling companion. The winos, neo-pagans, and deadbeat Lotharios of Pine Cove, meanwhile, have other ideas. And none of them is quite prepared when all hell breaks loose.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/54/25/9780060735425.jpg", "title_long": "Practical Demonkeeping (Pine Cove Series, 1)", "dimensions": "Height: 0.61 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 5.34 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.34}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.43}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.61}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2004-05-25", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Christopher Moore'], 'title": "Practical Demonkeeping (Pine Cove Series, 1)", "isbn13": "9780060735425", "msrp": 14.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0061802638", "ePub": "0061802638"}, "isbn": "0060735422", "isbn10": "0060735422", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061802638", "binding": "print"}]}}
