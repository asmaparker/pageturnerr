{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Stroke. The word, like the disease, seems sudden and violent. To most, especially those who have witnessed its effects, the disease seems to come out of nowhere, attacking healthy people without warning and leaving them devastated -- paralyzed, helpless, disoriented...and worse.<br/>In recent years, much has been written about ways to predict and prevent other leading causes of death and disability, cancer and heart disease, for example. But when it comes to our nation\'s number one disabler and number three killer, our lack of insight into its causes has left us feeling helpless, even fatalistic: we\'ve simply been unable to predict or prevent it...until now.<br/>In Stroke-Free for Life: The Complete Guide to Stroke Prevention and Treatment, renowned neurologist David Wiebers, M.D., offers a simple yet comprehensive self-test that allows you to determine your risk of stroke, including questions concerning lifestyle, medications, neurologic and cardiac history, family history, and other medical concerns.
