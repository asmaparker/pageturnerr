{"book": {"publisher": "Yale University Press", "synopsis": "With the radical changes in information production that the Internet has introduced, we stand at an important moment of transition, says Yochai Benkler in this thought-provoking book. The phenomenon he describes as social production is reshaping markets, while at the same time offering new opportunities to enhance individual freedom, cultural diversity, political discourse, and justice. But these results are by no means inevitable: a systematic campaign to protect the entrenched industrial information economy of the last century threatens the promise of today’s emerging networked information environment.<br/>In this comprehensive social theory of the Internet and the networked information economy, Benkler describes how patterns of information, knowledge, and cultural production are changing\x97and shows that the way information and knowledge are made available can either limit or enlarge the ways people can create and express themselves. He describes the range of legal and policy choices that confront us and maintains that there is much to be gained\x97or lost\x97by the decisions we make today.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/62/9780300110562.jpg", "title_long": "The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.13 Inches, Weight: 2.00179733896 Pounds, Width: 1.47 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.13}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.47}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.00179733896}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 528, "date_published": "2006-05-16", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Computers & Technology', 'Certification', 'History & Culture', 'Computer & Internet Law', 'Law', 'Legal Theory & Systems', 'Science & Technology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Yochai Benkler'], 'title": "The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom", "isbn13": "9780300110562", "msrp": 47, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0300110561", "isbn10": "0300110561"}}
