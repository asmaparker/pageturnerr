{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Star Jones Reynolds had done it all. College on scholarship, law school on loans, and life by faith. She had achieved a prestigious career as a lawyer and prosecutor, provided much-needed calm and insight while reporting the Rodney King and O. J. Simpson trials on television, and landed a spot cohosting one of America\'s most popular daytime television shows, The View. Then why was she feeling so down?<br/>It all began when Star took a close look at herself and her life and realized she wasn\'t happy with what she saw: obesity precluded her from crossing her legs, she needed an asthma inhaler, she couldn\'t fasten her own necklace, and, worst of all, she got too tired to shop -- a disaster because Star Jones Reynolds is a seriously committed shopper.<br/>Then she realized something else: with all her extraordinary accomplishments, none of it mattered without true love. Thinking long and hard, she finally understood that she hadn\'t yet met the man of her dreams because she wasn\'t ready for him.<br/>Star decided to make it happen. She began a personal journey to reconstitute her physical look, emotional state, and already strong spirituality. Even if she didn\'t find love, it would be a win-win situation because she\'d emerge from the experience a healthier, happier woman -- one who could truly shine. Unless you live on another planet, you know Star succeeded in her quest and did find true love -- and it wasn\'t that hard at all. In Shine, she shares it all in her wise, revealing, irreverent, laugh-out-loud style.<br/>Shine is divided into three main sections, each exploring core issues of interest to women. Part One guides women toward being their most attractive physical selves using Star\'s personal secrets on losing weight and finding hair, fashion, and makeup chic (inexpensively). Part Two asks tough questions about emotional preparedness for a relationship and shows you how to think like lawyers, and how to get your financial and emotional houses in order. Part Three delves into a woman\'s spiritual life -- discover how to talk to God no matter what your religion. Spiking the book are Star\'s "absolutes" -- truisms that have always worked for her and continue to give her guidance -- quizzes and self-assessment exercises that will help you focus on your particular strengths and weaknesses.<br/>Everyone knows Star Jones Reynolds is a success story, a happy, rough-edges-to-emotional-and-financial-riches tale. Until you read this book, you won\'t know how she got there -- and how you can echo her triumphs and shine.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/81/9780060824181.jpg', 'title_long': 'Shine: A Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Journey to Finding Love', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.01573 Inches, Length: 5.98424 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 1.10236 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.98424}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.10236}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.01573}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006-01-06', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Love & Romance', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Beauty, Grooming, & Style'], 'authors': ['Star Jones Reynolds'], 'title': 'Shine: A Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Journey to Finding Love', 'isbn13': '9780060824181', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061844497'}, 'isbn': '0060824182', 'isbn10': '0060824182', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061844492', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
