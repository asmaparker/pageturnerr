Twenty years ago, Hurston"s work was largely out-of-print, her literary legacy alive only to a tiny, devoted band of readers who were often forced to photocopy her works if they were to be taught ... Today her works are central to the canon of African-American, American, and Women"s literatures ... The author of four novels, Jonah"s Gourd Vine (1934), Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937),Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939), and Seraph on the Suwanee (1948); two books of folklore -- Mules and Men (1935) and Tell My Horse (1938); an autobiography, Dust Tracks On a Road (1942); and over 50 short stories, essays, and plays, Hurston was one of the most widely acclaimed Black authors for the two decades between 1925 and 1945. -- from the Preface by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/88/9781567430288.jpg", "title_long": "Zora neale Hurston: Critical Perspectives Past And Present (Amistad Literary Series)", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.15963149812 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.15963149812}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 238, "date_published": "2000-02-11", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'United States', 'Classics'], 'authors": ["Henry L Gates'], 'title": "Zora neale Hurston: Critical Perspectives Past And Present (Amistad Literary Series)", "isbn13": "9781567430288", "msrp": 14.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1567430287", "isbn10": "1567430287"}}
