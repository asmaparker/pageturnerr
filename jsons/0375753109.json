While watching the pollination of the Duchess de Guermantes’s orchid, the narrator secretly observes a sexual encounter between two men. “Flower and plant have no conscious will,” Samuel Beckett wrote of Proust’s representation of sexuality. “They are shameless, exposing their genitals. And so in a sense are Proust’s men and women . . . shameless. There is no question of right and wrong.”<br/><br/>For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin’s acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff’s translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of Á la recherché du temps perdu (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade in 1989).", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/07/9780375753107.jpg", "title_long": "In Search of Lost Time Volume IV Sodom and Gomorrah (Modern Library Classics)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.02 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 1.18829159218 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.18829159218}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.02}}, "pages": 784, "date_published": "1999-02-16", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Marcel Proust'], 'title": "In Search of Lost Time Volume IV Sodom and Gomorrah (Modern Library Classics)", "isbn13": "9780375753107", "msrp": 17, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375753109", "isbn10": "0375753109"}}
