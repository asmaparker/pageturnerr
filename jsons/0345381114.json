{"book": {"publisher": "Ballantine Books", "synopsis": "“When inquiring minds want to know, there is someone to turn to for an answer.”—The Wall Street Journal<br/><br/>Cecil Adams’s first two books covered everything from the real lyrics to "Louie, Louie," to whatever became of Einstein\"s brain. You probably thought you couldn\'t stand any more genius in one lifetime. Well, fasten your intellectual seat belts!<br/><br/>In Return of the Straight Dope, you’ll find 100% guaranteed top quality brilliance on every page, as Adams winsomely and wisely answers questions like these: Can people really hear radio broadcasts through their teeth? What does Queen Elizabeth carry in that purse, anyway? So how DO porcupines mate? And many more. When you hear the answers, you’ll be glad someone asked the questions.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/18/9780345381118.jpg", "title_long": "Return of the Straight Dope: Still More from the Popular Newspaper Column", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.15522225288 Pounds, Width: 1 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.15522225288}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 448, "date_published": "1994-04-12", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Parodies', 'Puzzles & Games', 'Trivia', 'Reference'], 'authors": ["Cecil Adams'], 'title": "Return of the Straight Dope: Still More from the Popular Newspaper Column", "isbn13": "9780345381118", "msrp": 23, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345381114", "isbn10": "0345381114"}}
