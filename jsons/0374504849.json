{"book": {"publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "synopsis": "An Intimate Window into the American Immigrant Experience<br/><br/>Morris Bober, the family patriarch, yearns for better fortune as he runs a grocery store, never expecting how two robbers would change his life. Working alongside Morris, Frank Alpine, with his own complex relationship with the Jewish community, finds himself entangled in a web of emotions and conflicting actions. As he becomes smitten with Helen Bober, he simultaneously finds himself embroiled in acts of theft.<br/><br/>This tale of love, family, and ambition sits within the broader landscape of a New York cityscape steeped in a vibrant mix of Italian-American and Jewish cultures. The stark realities of 1950s Brooklyn color this narrative in a way that is as vivid as it is compelling.<br/><br/>Like Malamud"s best stories, this novel unerringly evokes an immigrant world of cramped circumstances and great expectations. With a blend of contemporary American literature and psychological fiction, Malamud offers an inimitable insight into the nuances of immigrant family life while shedding light on the universal human experience.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/47/9780374504847.jpg", "title_long": "The Assistant: A Novel", "dimensions": "Height: 8.1999836 Inches, Length: 5.4499891 Inches, Weight: 0.54 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4499891}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.54}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.1999836}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2003-07-07", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Classics', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Bernard Malamud'], 'title": "The Assistant: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780374504847", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0374504849", "isbn10": "0374504849", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781466805002", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
