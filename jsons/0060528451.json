{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Jane Jeffry and longtime beau Detective Mel VanDyne finally decide to marry, but Mel's overbearing mother wants to take charge of not only the rehearsal dinner but the actual wedding. Since Jane half expected Mel's mother to steamroll the entire event, she agreesâ€”but with rules of her own. No bridesmaids, no groomsmen. And she can't tell Jane what to wear.<br/>But during what should have been a blissful interval between the engagement and the bouquet toss, several other occurrences take place. Mel convinces Jane and her best friend, Shelley Nowack, to take a women's safety class. They learn a lot, but the class is cut short when a dead body is discovered. So between Jane's wedding planning, her new writing project, and a battle between both mother-in-laws (which Jane encourages), a murderer must be found before this bride can walk happily down the aisle.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/54/9780060528454.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Accidental Florist (Jane Jeffry Mysteries, No. 16)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.87}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2007-02-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Jill Churchill'], 'title': 'The Accidental Florist (Jane Jeffry Mysteries, No. 16)', 'isbn13': '9780060528454', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060528451', 'isbn10': '0060528451'}}
