{'book': {'publisher': 'Gingko Pr Inc', 'synopsis': "Clubspotting offers a quick and dynamic picture of the here and now of club culture, Italian style. No longer tightly bound to the Anglo-Saxon fast paced squeal of the electric guitar, today's twenty year olds move to the bits and beats of the sonic studio/laboratory where new instruments such as the PC Cubase and Sampler prevail. 'Club culture' is their catch cry, 'electronic' the standard form of expression. This totally visual book is the creative expression of a world that is non-political and post-hedonist, nervously wordless and volatile. It's a short journey that attempts to makes club culture understood, available and fascinating for everyone. Artists featured include Jazzanova, Howie B, Krust and Michael Reinbot. The book is divided into sections: Flyer Zone, Club Zine, Art Zone, Nu Directors and Clubs on the Web.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/45/9788886416245.jpg', 'title_long': 'Clubspotting: A Journey Into Club Culture', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 9.75 Inches, Weight: 1.23238404458 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.23238404458}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2001-02-01', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'History & Criticism', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture'], 'authors': ['Paolo Davoli', 'Gabriele Fantuzzi', 'Young-Soo Kwon', 'Yong-Seock Jung'], 'title': 'Clubspotting: A Journey Into Club Culture', 'isbn13': '9788886416245', 'msrp': 29.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '8886416245', 'isbn10': '8886416245'}}
