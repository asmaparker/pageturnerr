{'book': {'publisher': 'Pearson College Div', 'synopsis': "For courses in Intermediate Algebra that incorporate a graphing calculator.Unique and enthusiastic in its approach, Lehmann's text is a rich combination of important skills, concepts, and applications. This text captivates students' and instructors' interest as they use curve fitting to model current, compelling, and authentic situations. The curve fitting approach emphasizes concepts related to functions in a natural, substantial way and encourages students to view functions graphically, numerically, and symbolically as well as to verbally describe concepts related to functions. The examples in the test demonstrate both how to perform skills and how to investigate concepts. Students learn why they perform skills to solve problems as well as how to solve the problems. Explorations deepen students' understanding as they investigate mathematics with graphing calculator and pencil and paper activities.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/55/9780130148155.jpg', 'title_long': 'Intermediate Algebra: Functions and Authentic Applications', 'edition': 'Solution Manual', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.6 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.6}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Pure Mathematics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Jay Lehmann'], 'title': 'Intermediate Algebra: Functions and Authentic Applications', 'isbn13': '9780130148155', 'msrp': 33.33, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0130148156', 'isbn10': '0130148156'}}
