{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': '"There is no such thing as a bad child, just bad parents."<br/>We are all familiar with the kind of advice for parents offered by family, friends, passersby, and social services -- that being advice of the uninvited, unhelpful, unrealistic, and plain unhinged variety. Now, for the first time, the best parenting advice has been gathered together so that you might sidestep the worrying chore of consulting the experts and create your very own pick-and-choose approach to child rearing, happy in the knowledge that someone, somewhere, thinks you\'re doing it right.<br/>For any parent who has tried and failed to meet the expectations of the "Baby Whisperer," opinionated in-laws, Dr. Spock, and the hordes of other unsolicited meddlers, here is the perfect remedy. This wickedly refreshing book is a must-have for stressed-out parents everywhere.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/48/9780061123948.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Complete Guide to Uninvited Advice on Raising Children', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.125 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.561111 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.561111}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.52}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 112, 'date_published': '2006-04-11', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Love, Sex & Marriage', 'Parenting & Families', 'Parenting & Relationships'], 'authors': ['Alice Beaven'], 'title': 'The Complete Guide to Uninvited Advice on Raising Children', 'isbn13': '9780061123948', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061123943', 'isbn10': '0061123943'}}
