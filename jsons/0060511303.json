{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "Paranoid yet judiciously reasonable, innocent yet calculating, strange yet strangely endearing, Emmet Barfield finds the world around him looming larger and larger the more he struggles to make his way within it. With Emmet as our guide, Force of Gravity transforms the world through a solitary consciousness until the reader's perceptions become as inverted as if seen through a modern version of Alice's looking glass.<br/>Emmet's world is a place where shopping in a market requires the cunning of a carefully considered crime, where a bustling city street in summer appears as desolate as a forgotten wasteland, where a stray cat adopted for company becomes as menacing as one's darkest foe, and where a mother and son riding a ski lift suddenly find themselves dizzy with the threat of death. Through his eyes, the world becomes newly alive with the terrible vividness and weird beauty of an undiscovered territory.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/02/9780060511302.jpg', 'title_long': 'Force of Gravity: A Novel', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.51 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.51}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2002-10-08', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Friendship', 'Psychological', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Disability Fiction', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['R.S.
