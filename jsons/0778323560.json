{"book": {"publisher": "MIRA", "synopsis": "The job was supposed to be dead easy—hand-deliver some legal papers to billionaire philanthropist Harry Van Dorn"s extravagant yacht, get his signature and be done. But Manhattan lawyer Genevieve Spenser soon realizes she"s in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that the publicly benevolent playboy has a sick, vicious side. As he tries to make her his plaything for the evening, eager to use and abuse her until he discards her with the rest of his victims, Genevieve must keep her wits if she intends to survive the night.<br/><br/>But there"s someone else on the ship who knows the true depths of Van Dorn's evil. Peter Jensen is far more than the unassuming personal assistant he pretends to be—he's a secret operative who will stop at nothing to ensure Harry's deadly Rule of Seven terror campaign dies with him. But Genevieve's presence has thrown a wrench into his plans, and now he must decide whether to risk his mission to keep her alive, or allow her to become collateral damage\x85.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/63/9780778323563.jpg", "title_long": "Cold as Ice (The Ice Series, 2)", "dimensions": "Height: 6.61 Inches, Length: 4.2200703 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.2200703}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.97}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.61}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2006-10-24", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense'], 'authors": ['Anne Stuart'], 'title": "Cold as Ice (The Ice Series, 2)", "isbn13": "9780778323563", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0778323560", "isbn10": "0778323560"}}
