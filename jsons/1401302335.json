{"book": {"publisher": "Hyperion", "synopsis": "Based on the longest-running one-man show in San Francisco history -- now coming to Off-Broadway -- a hilarious, poignant, and disarming memoir of growing up black in an all-white suburb<br/>In 1972, when Brian Copeland was eight, his family moved from Oakland to San Leandro, California, hoping for a better life. At the time, San Leandro was 99.4 percent white, known nationwide as a racist enclave. This reputation was confirmed almost immediately: Brian got his first look at the inside of a cop car, for being a black kid walking to the park with a baseball bat.<br/>Brian grew up to be a successful comedian and radio talk show host, but racism reemerged as an issue -- only in reverse -- when he received an anonymous letter: "As an African American, I am disgusted every time I hear your voice because YOU are not a genuine Black man!" That letter inspired Copeland to revisit his difficult childhood, resulting in a hit one-man show that has been running for nearly two years -- which has now inspired a book. In this funny, surprising, and ultimately moving memoir, Copeland shows exactly how our surroundings make us who we are.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/37/9781401302337.jpg", "title_long": "Not a Genuine Black Man: Or, How I Claimed My Piece of Ground in the Lily-White Suburbs", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 6.5 Inches, Length: 9.5 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2006-07-11", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Lawyers & Judges', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'United States', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Race Relations'], 'authors": ["Brian Copeland'], 'title": "Not a Genuine Black Man: Or, How I Claimed My Piece of Ground in the Lily-White Suburbs", "isbn13": "9781401302337", "msrp": 22.95, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"ePub": "1401385699"}, "isbn": "1401302335", "isbn10": "1401302335", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781401385699", "binding": "print"}]}}
