But breaking with "The Tradition' that guides the kingdoms comes with a cost—one that could leave her powerless and destitute. Until, that is, her fairy godmother intervenes and offers her a most unexpected job… to become her apprentice, and learn the ways of magic.<br/><br/>Now, instead of sleeping in the chimney, Elena must guide others along their own fated paths. And, of course, deal with arrogant, stuffed-shirt princes who keep trying to rise above their place. But when she finds herself falling for someone completely unexpected, she begins to question where her own path will lead her—and whether she’s willing to take fate into her own hands.
