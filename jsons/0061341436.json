And it's Zoë's job as the Muse of Beauty to transform him from nerd to hunk. First to go are those wire-framed glasses . . . revealing a devilish twinkle in his blue eyes. Next is a close shave . . . showing off that sexy grin, not to mention dimples that can charm the clothes off this muse. It would be so easy to fall for Theo, but the number-one rule during Zoë's exile from Mount Olympus is don't fall in love, especially with a mortal. Will Zoë succeed in keeping her heart safe, or will she risk all for a lifetime with her very own Mr. Right?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/34/9780061341434.jpg', 'title_long': 'Making Over Mr. Right (Goddess, Book 3)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-02-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Judi McCoy'], 'title': 'Making Over Mr. Right (Goddess, Book 3)', 'isbn13': '9780061341434', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061747211'}, 'isbn': '0061341436', 'isbn10': '0061341436', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061747212', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
