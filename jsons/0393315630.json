{"book": {"publisher": "W. W. Norton & Company", "synopsis": ""For anyone who gets high on language, this book is a fantastic trip...a real tour de force."―Madison Smartt Bell, Spin The acclaimed author of the cult classics Trainspotting and The Acid House, Irvine Welsh has been hailed as "the best thing that has happened to British writing in a decade' (London Sunday Times). This audacious novel is a brilliant (and literal) head trip of a book that brings us into the wildly active, albeit coma-beset, mind of Roy Strang, whose hallucinatory quest to eradicate the evil predator/scavenger marabou stork keeps being interrupted by grisly memories of the social and family dysfunction that brought him to this state. It is the sort of lethally funny cocktail of pathos, violence, and outrageous hilarity that only Irvine Welsh can pull off.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/39/9780393315639.jpg", "title_long": "Marabou Stork Nightmares", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.58}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.3}}, "pages": 280, "date_published": "1997-01-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Irvine Welsh'], 'title": "Marabou Stork Nightmares", "isbn13": "9780393315639", "msrp": 22.95, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0393315630", "isbn10": "0393315630", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780393285215", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
