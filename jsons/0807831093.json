{"book": {"publisher": "Univ of North Carolina Pr", "synopsis": "In a direct, frank, and intimate exploration of Iranian literature and society, scholar, teacher, and poet Fatemeh Keshavarz challenges popular perceptions of Iran as a society bereft of vitality and joy. Her fresh perspective on present-day Iran provides a rare insight into this rich culture alive with artistic expression but virtually unknown to most Americans.<br/><br/>Keshavarz introduces readers to two modern Iranian women writers whose strong and articulate voices belie the stereotypical perception of Iranian women as voiceless victims in a country of villains. She follows with a lively critique of the recent best-sellerReading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books, which epitomizes what Keshavarz calls the "New Orientalist narrative," a view marred by stereotype and prejudice more often tied to current geopolitical conflicts than to an understanding of Iran.<br/><br/>Blending in firsthand glimpses of her own life--from childhood memories in 1960s Shiraz to her present life as a professor in America--Keshavarz paints a portrait of Iran depicting both cultural depth and intellectual complexity. With a scholar\"s expertise and a poet\'s hand, she helps amplify the powerful voices of contemporary Iranians and leads readers toward a deeper understanding of the country\'s past and present.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/90/9780807831090.jpg", "title_long": "Jasmine and Stars: Reading More Than Lolita in Tehran (Islamic Civilization and Muslim Networks)", "edition": "SECOND PRINTING", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.9}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 174, "date_published": "2007", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Movements & Periods', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Women's Studies', 'Women Writers'], 'authors": ["Fatemeh Keshavarz'], 'title": "Jasmine and Stars: Reading More Than Lolita in Tehran (Islamic Civilization and Muslim Networks)", "isbn13": "9780807831090", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"eBook": "0807883751", "ePub": "0807883751"}, "isbn": "0807831093", "isbn10": "0807831093", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780807883754", "binding": "ebook"}]}}
