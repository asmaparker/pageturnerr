So he takes to the road with a girl named Melinda in order to find answers. As the pair travels through the United States they find that, while each town has been affected differently by the mysterious source of the apocalypse, none of the people they meet can fill in their incomplete memories or answer their questions. Gradually, figures from Chaos"s past, including some who appear only under the influence of intravenously administered drugs, make Chaos remember some of his forgotten life as a man named Moon.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/47/9780156031547.jpg", "title_long": "Amnesia Moon", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 0.64 Inches, Length: 8.05 Inches, Weight: 0.67 Pounds, Width: 5.36 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.05}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.36}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.67}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.64}}, "pages": 247, "date_published": "2005-08-08", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Post-Apocalyptic', 'Humorous'], 'authors": ["Jonathan Lethem'], 'title": "Amnesia Moon", "isbn13": "9780156031547", "msrp": 11.81, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0547536925"}, "isbn": "015603154X", "isbn10": "015603154X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780547536927", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
