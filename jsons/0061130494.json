{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Forty-two-year-old Shelley Marino's desperate yearning for a child has led her to one of the only doors still open to her: foreign adoption. It is a decision that strains and ultimately shatters her relationship with her husband, Martin—the veteran of an Asian war who cannot reconcile what Shelley wants with what he knows about the world. But it unites her with Mai, who emigrated from Vietnam decades ago and has now acquired the accoutrements of the American dream in an effort to dull the memory of the tragedy that drove her from her homeland. As a powerful friendship is forged, two women embark on a life-altering journey to the world Mai left behind—to confront the stark realities of a painful past and embrace the promise of the future.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/96/9780061130496.jpg', 'title_long': 'If You Lived Here: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2008-03-11', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Asian American', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Dana Sachs'], 'title': 'If You Lived Here: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780061130496', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061844144'}, 'isbn': '0061130494', 'isbn10': '0061130494', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061844140', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
