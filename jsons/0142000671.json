{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin", "synopsis": "They are an unlikely pair: George is "small and quick and dark of face"; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a "family,' clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California\'s dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.<br/><br/>When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations of a flirtatious woman, nor predict the consequences of Lennie\'s unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. 'A thriller, a gripping tale . . . that you will not set down until it is finished. Steinbeck has touched the quick.' â€”The New York Times', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/06/70/9780142000670.jpg", "title_long": "Of Mice and Men (Steinbeck Centennial Edition)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.61 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.35 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.61}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.35}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4}}, "pages": 112, "date_published": "2002-01-08", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John Steinbeck'], 'title": "Of Mice and Men (Steinbeck Centennial Edition)", "isbn13": "9780142000670", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0142000671", "isbn10": "0142000671"}}
