It's only a few hours later on that snowy Friday night in 1979 that she descends into a coma. Nine months later she gives birth to a daughter, Megan, her child by Richard, the protagonist of this disturbingly funny novel.<br/>Karen remains comatose for the next seventeen years. Richard and her circle of friends reside in an emotional purgatory throughout the next two decades; passing through careers as models, film special effects technicians, doctors, and demolition experts, before finally being reunited on a conspiracyâ€“driven supernatural television series.<br/>Upon Karen's reawakening, life grows as surreal as their television show. With apocalyptic events occurring, Karen, Richard, and their friends explore the essential mysteries of life, faith, decency, and existence. Amid the world's rubble they attempt to restore their own humanity.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/29/9780060987329.jpg', 'title_long': 'Girlfriend in a Coma', 'edition': 'Later Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.465 Pounds, Width: 0.648649 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.648649}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.465}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1999-03-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Douglas Coupland'], 'title': 'Girlfriend in a Coma', 'isbn13': '9780060987329', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060987324', 'isbn10': '0060987324'}}
