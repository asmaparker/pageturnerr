{"book": {"publisher": "Thomas Nelson Inc", "synopsis": "God designed men to be dangerous, says John Eldredge. Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy: To be a hero, to be a warrior, to live a life of adventure and risk. Sadly, most men abandon those dreams and desires-aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a "nice guy." It is no wonder that many men avoid church, and those who go are often passive and bored to death. In this provocative book, Eldredge gives women a look inside the true heart of a man and gives men permission to be what God designed them to be-dangerous, passionate, alive, and free!", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/33/9780785268833.jpg", "title_long": "Wild At Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man"s Soul (Hard Cover)", 'edition": "Book Club (BCE/BOMC)", "dimensions": "Height: 0.8 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 0.000625 Pounds, Width: 5.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.000625}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}}, "pages": 223, "date_published": "2001", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living'], 'authors": ["John Eldredge'], 'title": "Wild At Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man"s Soul (Hard Cover)", 'isbn13": "9780785268833", "msrp": 21.99, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"ePub": "1418509280"}, "isbn": "0785268839", "isbn10": "0785268839", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781418509286", "binding": "print"}]}}
