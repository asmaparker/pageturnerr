{'book': {'publisher': 'Laura Geringer', 'synopsis': "Susanna Shakespeare finds the small town of Stratford-upon-Avon much too quiet and provincial. She yearns to travel to London to see her father's world of players and poets, and to follow a secret dream of her own. Once Susanna arrives in London, nothing is quite as she expected it to be -- least of all her relationship with her famous father. But propelled by her love for Thomas Cole, a Catholic chorister, and her desire to sing, Susanna discovers that it is only with the support of those who love her that she has the strength to succeed.<br/>Screenwriter Peter W. Hassinger creates a Shakespearean tale rife with imagery and beauty that pays homage to the Bard himself.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/71/9780060284671.jpg', 'title_long': "Shakespeare's Daughter", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.04 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.05}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2004-04-01', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Historical Fiction', 'Europe', 'Renaissance'], 'authors': ['Peter W.
