Yet recent studies have shown that by eating right, staying physically active, and maintaining a healthy weight, we can cut the risk of cancer by 30 to 40 per cent. The cancer–fighting vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals found in vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts and wholegrains work together to produce significant healing and protection against all kinds of cancer. But to make the right dietary adjustments, you need to know which foods contain which cancer–fighting nutrients – information that until now hasn't been easy to find in one easy–to–use reference.<br/>Foods That Combat Cancer is the first book introducing a cancer–fighting diet, providing food names and recipes, and listing over 2000 brand name and basic food items, with the anti–cancer nutrients found in each one, based on serving size. From vegetables to snacks, you'll discover not only what foods are best for an anti–cancer diet, but how much you should be eating everyday.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/46/9780060505646.jpg', 'title_long': 'Foods That Combat Cancer: The Nutritional Way to Wellness', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.26 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.26}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2006-10-31', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Special Diet', 'Cancer', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diseases & Physical Ailments', 'Nutrition', 'Cancer Prevention', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine'], 'authors': ['Maggie Greenwood-Robinson PhD'], 'title': 'Foods That Combat Cancer: The Nutritional Way to Wellness', 'isbn13': '9780060505646', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060505648', 'isbn10': '0060505648'}}
