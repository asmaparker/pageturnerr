{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER • Didion\"s "reportorial pieces afford the pleasures of literature.... She is an expert geographer of the landscape of American public culture" (The New York Times Book Review).<br/><br/>Here, the National Book Award–winning author of The Year of Magical Thinking covers ground from Washington to Los Angeles, from a TV producer\'s gargantuan 'manor' to the racial battlefields of New York\'s criminal courts.<br/><br/>At each stop she uncovers the mythic narratives that elude other observers: Didion tells us about the fantasies the media construct around crime victims and presidential candidates; she gives us new interpretations of the stories of Nancy Reagan and Patty Hearst; she charts America\'s rollercoaster ride through evanescent booms and hard times that won\'t go away.<br/><br/>A bracing amalgam of skepticism and sympathy, After Henry is further proof of Joan Didion\'s infallible radar for the true spirit of our age.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/96/9780679745396.jpg", "title_long": "After Henry", "edition": "1st Vintage Intl.
