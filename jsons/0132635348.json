{'book': {'publisher': '1992', 'synopsis': 'Designed for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate courses in kinetics and reactor theory, this text presents a treatment of chemical engineering kinetics and reaction design. It takes a structured approach to solving reaction engineering problems - seeking to encourage students to solve problems through reasoning rather than memorization. New features in this second edition are homework problems using real reactions and real data, which are graded in difficulty, and material on emerging technologies in chemical engineering, including micro-electronics (CVD, etching and boat reactors), biotechnology (microbial growth kinetics and chemostat design) and polymerization kinetics. The overall aim is to enable students to solve reaction engineering problems using software packages.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/49/9780132635349.jpg', 'title_long': 'Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering (Prentice-Hall International Series in the Physical and Chemical Engineering Sciences)', 'edition': '2nd Ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.52754 Inches, Length: 7.16534 Inches, Weight: 3.086471668 Pounds, Width: 1.45669 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.16534}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.45669}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.086471668}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.52754}}, 'pages': 876, 'date_published': '1991', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Chemical', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['H.
