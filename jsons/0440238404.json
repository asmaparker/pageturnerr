The family trip is her mother\'s doing: Mrs. Gardner wants to volunteer at the orphanage that cared for her when she was young. But going to India isn\'t Jazz\'s idea of a great summer vacation. She wants no part of her mother\'s do-gooder endeavors.<br/><br/>What\'s more, Jazz is heartsick. She\'s leaving the business she and her best friend, Steve Morales, started--as well as Steve himself. Jazz is crazy in love with the guy. If only he knew!<br/><br/>Only when Jazz reluctantly befriends Danita, a girl who cooks for her family, and who faces a tough dilemma, does Jazz begin to see how she can make a difference--to her own family, to Danita, to the children at the orphanage, even to Steve. As India claims Jazz, the monsoon works its madness and its magic.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/09/9780440238409.jpg", "title_long": "Monsoon Summer", "dimensions": "Height: 6.92 Inches, Length: 5.53 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.53}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.92}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2006-04-11", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors": ["Mitali Perkins'], 'title": "Monsoon Summer", "isbn13": "9780440238409", "msrp": 6.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307433579"}, "isbn": "0440238404", "isbn10": "0440238404", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307433572", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
