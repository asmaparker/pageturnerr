Camaban becomes a great visionary and feared wise man, and it is his vision that will force the youngest brother, Saban, to create the great temple on the green hill where the gods will appear on earth. Saban’ s love for Aurenna, the sun bride whose destiny is to die for the gods, finally brings the rivalries of the brothers to a head. But it is also his skills that will build the vast temple, a place for the gods, certainly, but also a place that will confirm for ever the supreme power of the tribe that built it.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/51/9780060956851.jpg', 'title_long': 'Stonehenge', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.76 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.76}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 433, 'date_published': '2004-12-14', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'War', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Romance', 'War & Military', 'Contemporary', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Military', 'Supernatural'], 'authors': ['Bernard Cornwell'], 'title': 'Stonehenge', 'isbn13': '9780060956851', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060956852', 'isbn10': '0060956852', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061841002', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
