This book shows how God can redeem seemingly hopeless relationships, and it illustrates one of Gary Smalley’s key messages: Love is a decision.<br/>Redemption is the first book in the five-book Redemption series that Gary and Karen will write about the Baxter family—their fears and desires, their strengths and weaknesses, their losses and victories. Each book will explore key relationship themes as well as the larger theme of redemption, both in characters’ spiritual lives and in their relationships. Each book includes study questions for individual and small-group use as well as a "teaser" chapter of the next book in the series.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/20/9780842356220.jpg", "title_long": "Redemption (Redemption Series-Baxter 1, Book 1)", "edition": "First Edition / First Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.70106999316 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.70106999316}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2002-08", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ['Karen Kingsbury', 'Gary Smalley'], 'title": "Redemption (Redemption Series-Baxter 1, Book 1)", "isbn13": "9780842356220", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0842356223", "isbn10": "0842356223"}}
