But it turns out it's Dulcie, Joe's pretty little cat-friend, who came up with the idea of subjecting Joe to the cooing attentions of a bunch of doddering old coots. Dulcie believes there's more going on at the old folks' home than the care and feeding of lonely seniors. And she needs Joe's help in getting to the bottom of a conspiracy ... and a very suspicious set of deaths.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/24/9780061056024.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cat Raise the Dead: A Joe Grey Mystery (Joe Grey Mystery Series, 3)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.81 Inches, Length: 6.76 Inches, Weight: 0.33 Pounds, Width: 4.36 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.76}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.36}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.33}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.81}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '1999-12-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Cozy', 'Supernatural', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Shirley Rousseau Murphy'], 'title': 'Cat Raise the Dead: A Joe Grey Mystery (Joe Grey Mystery Series, 3)', 'isbn13': '9780061056024', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061740217'}, 'isbn': '0061056022', 'isbn10': '0061056022', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061740213', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
