{'book': {'publisher': 'Katherine Tegen Books', 'synopsis': "Wyldcliffe Abbey School for Young Ladies, housed in a Gothic mansion on the bleak northern moors, is elite, expensive, and unwelcoming. When Evie Johnson is torn away from her home by the sea to become the newest scholarship student, she is more isolated than she could have dreamed. Strict teachers, snobbish students, and the oppressive atmosphere of Wyldcliffe leave Evie drowning in loneliness.<br/>Evie's only lifeline is Sebastian, a rebellious, mocking, dangerously attractive young man she meets by chance. As Evie's feelings for Sebastian grow with each secret meeting, she starts to fear that he is hiding something about his past. And she is haunted by glimpses of a strange, ghostly girlâ€”a girl who is so eerily like Evie, she could be a sister. Evie is slowly drawn into a tangled web of past and present that she cannot control. And as the extraordinary, elemental forces of Wyldcliffe rise up like the mighty sea, Evie is faced with an astounding truth about Sebastian, and her own incredible fate.<br/>Gillian Shields's electrifying tale will dazzle readers with suspense, mysticism, and romance.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/04/9780061375804.jpg', 'title_long': 'Immortal (Immortal, 1)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2009-08-04', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Girls & Women', 'Mysteries & Thrillers', 'Romantic', 'Fantasy & Supernatural', 'Mystery & Detective', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Gillian Shields'], 'title': 'Immortal (Immortal, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061375804', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061375802', 'isbn10': '0061375802'}}
