{"book": {"publisher": "Swallow Press", "synopsis": "With an introduction by Allison Pease, this new edition of House of Incest is a lyrical journey into the subconscious mind of one of the most celebrated feminist writers of the twentieth-century.<br/>Originally published in 1936, \u202fHouse of Incest \u202fis Anaïs Nin’s first work of fiction. Based on Nin’s dreams, the novel is a surrealistic look within the narrator’s subconscious as she attempts to distance herself from a series of all-consuming and often taboo desires she cannot bear to let go. The incest Nin depicts is a metaphor—a selfish love wherein a woman can appreciate only qualities in a lover that are similar to her own. Through a descriptive exploration of romances and attractions between women, between a sister and her beloved brother, and with a Christ-like man, Nin’s narrator discovers what she thinks is truth: that a woman’s most perfect love is of herself. At first, this self-love seems ideal because it is attainable without fear and risk of heartbreak. But in time, the narrator’s chosen isolation and self-possessed anguish give way to a visceral nightmare from which she is unable to wake.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/89/9780804001489.jpg", "title_long": "House Of Incest", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.375 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.375}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.25}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 72, "date_published": "1991-02-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Anthologies', 'Regional & Cultural', 'United States'], 'authors": ["Anaïs Nin'], 'title": "House Of Incest", "isbn13": "9780804001489", "msrp": 11.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0804001480", "isbn10": "0804001480"}}
