{"book": {"publisher": "Sterling", "synopsis": "The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch & Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br/><br/>Scott created these drawings in scratchboard an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.<br/><br/>Born in India, the unattractive and willful Mary Lennox has remained in the care of servants for as long as she can remember. But the girlâ€™s life changes when her mother and father die and she travels to Yorkshire to live with her uncle. Dark, dreary Misselthwaite Manor seems full of mysteries, including a very special garden, locked tight for 10 years. With the help of Dickon, a local boy, Mary intends to uncover its secrets.", "language": "ru", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/97/9781402714597.jpg", "title_long": "Secret Garden", "edition": "Unabridged", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.1794731017 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.1794731017}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 248, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet'], 'authors": ["Author'], 'title": "Secret Garden", "isbn13": "9781402714597", "msrp": 9.95, "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1402714599", "isbn10": "1402714599", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781402792717", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
