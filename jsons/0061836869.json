{'book': {'publisher': 'Walden Pond Press', 'synopsis': "Liam has always felt a bit like he's stuck between two worlds. This isprimarily because he's a twelve-year-old kid who looks like he's about thirty. Sometimes it's not so bad, like when his new principal mistakes him for a teacher on the first day of school or when he convinces a car dealer to let him take a Porsche out on a test drive. But mostly it's just frustrating, being a kid trapped in an adult world. And so he decides to flip things around. Liam cons his way onto the first spaceship to take civilians into space, a special flight for a group of kids and an adult chaperone, and he is going as the adult chaperone. It's not long before Liam, along with his friends, is stuck between two worlds againâ€”only this time he's 239,000 miles from home.<br/>Frank Cottrell Boyce, author of Millions and Framed, brings us a funny and touching story of the many ways in which grown-upness is truly wasted on grown-ups.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/62/9780061836862.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cosmic', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.93125 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.05}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.93125}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2010-01-19', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Science, Nature & How It Works', 'Action & Adventure', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['Frank Cottrell Boyce'], 'title': 'Cosmic', 'isbn13': '9780061836862', 'msrp': 17.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0061836869', 'isbn10': '0061836869'}}
