A proud Southern gentleman damaged by the Civil War, he has come to Baltimore to find the daughter he never knew -- a beautiful child who is one of Maggie\"s favorites -- and bring her home to Virginia. And when he asks Maggie to accompany them, all she can say is "yes.'<br/>Widowed and wounded inside, Gordon turns to the emerald-eyed Irish beauty to help him pick up the pieces. Though he senses her distrust he is drawn to Maggie\'s angelic voice, her sensuality and passion...and to a tenderness that compels him to share with her his soul. But the scars of war go deep. And it will take uncommon strength for two people who stood on opposite sides to find redemption and a new life in love.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/92/9780380815692.jpg", "title_long": "The Nightingale"s Song", 'dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 1.1243575362 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.96}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.1243575362}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2001-10-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Kathleen Eschenburg'], 'title": "The Nightingale"s Song", 'isbn13": "9780380815692", "msrp": 6.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0380815699", "isbn10": "0380815699"}}
