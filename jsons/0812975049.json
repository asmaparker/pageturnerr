{"book": {"publisher": "Modern Library", "synopsis": "This 1862 novel, in a vibrant new translation by Peter Constantine, is Tolstoy’s semiautobiographical story of young Olenin, a wealthy, disaffected Muscovite who joins the Russian army and travels to the untamed frontier of the Caucasus in search of a more authentic life. While striving to adopt the rough and ready lifestyle of the local Cossacks, Olenin falls in love with a free-spirited girl whose fiancé turns out to be a formidable opponent. Showcasing the philosophical insight that would characterize Tolstoy’s later masterpieces, this long overdue translation is a revelation.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/48/9780812975048.jpg", "title_long": "The Cossacks (Modern Library Classics)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.35053499658 Pounds, Width: 0.41 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.41}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35053499658}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.96}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2006-02-14", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Leo Tolstoy'], 'title": "The Cossacks (Modern Library Classics)", "isbn13": "9780812975048", "msrp": 0.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "030775717X"}, "isbn": "0812975049", "isbn10": "0812975049", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307757173", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
