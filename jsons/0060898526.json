BRAVE NEW WORLD is a novel, whereas BRAVE NEW WORLD REVISITED is a nonfiction exploration of the themes in BRAVE NEW WORLD.<br/>When the novel Brave New World first appeared in 1932, its shocking analysis of a scientific dictatorship seemed a projection into the remote future. Here, in one of the most important and fascinating books of his career, Aldous Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy. He scrutinizes threats to humanity, such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion, and explains why we have found it virtually impossible to avoid them. Brave New World Revisited is a trenchant plea that humankind should educate itself for freedom before it is too late.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/85/26/9780060898526.jpg", "title_long": "Brave New World Revisited", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.32 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.32}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.25}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 144, "date_published": "2006-09-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Social Theory', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Aldous Huxley'], 'title": "Brave New World Revisited", "isbn13": "9780060898526", "msrp": 13.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0062368249", "ePub": "0062368249"}, "isbn": "0060898526", "isbn10": "0060898526", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780062368249", "binding": "print"}]}}
