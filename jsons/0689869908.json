{"book": {"publisher": "Aladdin", "synopsis": "Based on a true story, this heartwarming picture book shows how one gift changed the fate of a poor Ugandan family—especially the young girl who wanted to go to school.<br/><br/>More than anything, Beatrice longs to be a schoolgirl. But in her small African village, only children who can afford uniforms and books can go to school. Beatrice knows that with six children to care for, her family is much too poor. But then Beatrice receives a wonderful gift from some people far away—a goat!<br/><br/>Fat and sleek as a ripe mango, Mugisa (“luck”) gives milk that Beatrice can sell. With Mugisa’s help, Beatrice’s dream may come true after all!<br/><br/>Heifer Project International is a charitable organization that donates livestock to poor communities around the world, giving other families like Beatrice’s a chance to change their lives.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/07/9780689869907.jpg", "title_long": "Beatrices Goat By McBrier, Page/ Lohstoeter, Lori (ILT)/ Clinton, Hillary Rodham (AFT)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 10 Inches, Weight: 0.37 Pounds, Width: 0.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.37}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 40, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Animals', 'Farm Animals', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Difficult Discussions', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World'], 'authors": ["page-mcbrier'], 'title": "Beatrices Goat By McBrier, Page/ Lohstoeter, Lori (ILT)/ Clinton, Hillary Rodham (AFT)", "isbn13": "9780689869907", "msrp": 7.99, 'binding": "Library Binding", "isbn": "0689869908", "isbn10": "0689869908"}}
