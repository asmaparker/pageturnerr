Included among the more than 240 essays in this volume are Orwell’s famous discussion of pacifism, “My Country Right or Left”; his scathingly complicated views on the dirty work of imperialism in “Shooting an Elephant”; and his very firm opinion on how to make “A Nice Cup of Tea.”<br/><br/>In his essays, Orwell elevated political writing to the level of art, and his motivating ideas–his desire for social justice, his belief in universal freedom and equality, and his concern for truth in language–are as enduringly relevant now, a hundred years after his birth, as ever.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/36/9780375415036.jpg", "title_long": "Orwell: Essays: Introduction by John Carey (Everyman"s Library Contemporary Classics Series)", 'edition": "Second Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 8.32 Inches, Length: 5.45 Inches, Weight: 2.675 Pounds, Width: 2.51 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.45}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.51}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.675}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.32}}, "pages": 1416, "date_published": "2002-10-15", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'History & Criticism', 'Genres & Styles', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'World Literature', 'European', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture'], 'authors": ["George Orwell'], 'title": "Orwell: Essays: Introduction by John Carey (Everyman"s Library Contemporary Classics Series)", 'isbn13": "9780375415036", "msrp": 40, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0375415033", "isbn10": "0375415033"}}
