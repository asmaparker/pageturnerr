{"book": {"publisher": "Everyman"s Library", "synopsis": "Nabokov"s wise, ironic, elegant masterpiece owes its stature as a classic not to the controversy its subject matter aroused but to its author"s use of that material to tell a love story almost shocking in its beauty and tenderness. With an introduction by Martin Amis.<br/><br/>When it was published in 1955, Lolita immediately became a cause célèbre because of the freedom and sophistication with which it handled the unusual erotic predilections of its protagonist. Awe and exhilaration–along with heartbreak and mordant wit–abound in this account of the aging Humbert Humbert's obsessive, devouring, and doomed passion for the nymphet Dolores Haze.<br/>Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America, but most of all, it is a meditation on love–love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation.<br/><br/>Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket. Contemporary Classics include an introduction, a select bibliography, and a chronology of the author's life and times.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/30/9780679410430.jpg", "title_long": "Lolita: Introduction by Martin Amis (Everyman"s Library Contemporary Classics Series)", 'edition": "5th Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.11 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.11}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.3}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "1993-03-09", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Erotica', 'Literary', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Vladimir Nabokov'], 'title": "Lolita: Introduction by Martin Amis (Everyman"s Library Contemporary Classics Series)", 'isbn13": "9780679410430", "msrp": 25, "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0679410430", "isbn10": "0679410430", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307744029", "binding": "e"}]}}
