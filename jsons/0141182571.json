{"book": {"publisher": "PENGUIN", "synopsis": "Controversial and compelling, In Cold Blood reconstructs the murder in 1959 of a Kansas farmer, his wife and both their children. Truman Capote"s comprehensive study of the killings and subsequent investigation explores the circumstances surrounding this terrible crime and the effect it had on those involved. At the centre of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. The book that made Capote"s name, In Cold Blood is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.<br/><br/>An alternate cover of this ISBN can be found here.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/25/75/9780141182575.jpg", "title_long": "IN COLD BLOOD", "edition": "1.4.2000", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75589 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.5732018812 Pounds, Width: 0.82677 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.07873}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.82677}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5732018812}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75589}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2000", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology'], 'authors": ['CAPOTE TRUMAN'], 'title": "IN COLD BLOOD", "isbn13": "9780141182575", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0141182571", "isbn10": "0141182571"}}
