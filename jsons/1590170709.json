His brother, a slumlord, hires him to collect rent in the buildings he owns in Manhattan. Making his rounds from apartment to apartment, Moonbloom confronts a wildly varied assortment of brilliantly described urban characters, among them a gay jazz musician with a sideline as a gigolo, a Holocaust survivor, and a brilliant young black writer modeled on James Baldwin. Moonbloom hears their cries of outrage and abuse; he learns about their secret sorrows and desires. And as he grows familiar with their stories, he finds that he is drawn, in spite of his best judgment, into a desperate attempt to improve their lives.<br/><br/>Edward Lewis Wallant"s astonishing comic tour de force is a neglected masterpiece of 1960s America.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/00/9781590170700.jpg", "title_long": "The Tenants of Moonbloom (New York Review Books Classics)", "edition": "Revised ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 8.1 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.6283174467 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.6283174467}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.1}}, "pages": 264, "date_published": "2003-11-30", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Edward Lewis Wallant'], 'title": "The Tenants of Moonbloom (New York Review Books Classics)", "isbn13": "9781590170700", "msrp": 17.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1681373041"}, "isbn": "1590170709", "isbn10": "1590170709", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781681373041", "binding": "print"}]}}
