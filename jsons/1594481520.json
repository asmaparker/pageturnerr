The other six citizens must wait their turns in the Short-Term Residency Zone of the surrounding country of Outer Horner. It"s a long-standing arrangement between the fantastical, not-exactly-human citizens of the two countries. But when Inner Horner suddenly shrinks, forcing three-quarters of the citizen then in residence over the border into Outer Horner territory, the Outer Hornerites declare an Invasion In Progressâ€”having fallen under the spell of the power-hungry and demagogic Phil.<br/><br/>So begins The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil. An Animal Farm for the 21st century, this is an incendiary political satire of unprecedented imagination, spiky humor, and cautionary appreciation for the hysteric in everyone.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/29/9781594481529.jpg", "title_long": "The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.06 Inches, Length: 5.02 Inches, Weight: 0.34 Pounds, Width: 0.39 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.02}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.39}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.34}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.06}}, "pages": 134, "date_published": "2005-09-06", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopian', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["George Saunders'], 'title": "The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil", "isbn13": "9781594481529", "msrp": 13.54, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101217340", "ePub": "1101217340"}, "isbn": "1594481520", "isbn10": "1594481520", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101217344", "binding": "print"}]}}
