{"book": {"publisher": "William Morrow Paperbacks", "synopsis": "This installment in the 87th Precinct series finds the detectives stumped by a serial killer who doesn"t fit the profile. A blind violinist taking a smoke break, a cosmetics sales rep cooking an omelet in her own kitchen, a college professor trudging home from class, a priest contemplating retirement in the rectory garden, an old woman out walking her dog—these are the seemingly random targets shot twice in the face. But most serial killers don"t use guns. Most serial killers don"t strike five times in two weeks. And most serial killers' prey share something more than being over fifty years of age. Now it falls to Detective Steve Carella and his colleagues in the 87th Precinct to find out what-or whom-the victims had in common before another body is found.<br/><br/>With trademark wit and sizzling dialogue, McBain unravels a mystery and examines the dreams we chase in the darkening hours before the fiddlers have fled.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/80/9780156032780.jpg", "title_long": "Fiddlers: A Novel of the 87th Precinct (87th Precinct Mysteries (Paperback))", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.35 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.35}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.69}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.56}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.95}}, "pages": 276, "date_published": "2006-09-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Ed McBain'], 'title": "Fiddlers: A Novel of the 87th Precinct (87th Precinct Mysteries (Paperback))", "isbn13": "9780156032780", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0156032783", "isbn10": "0156032783", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780156035873", "binding": "print"}]}}
