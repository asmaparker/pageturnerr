A prophet without honor who had a profound understanding of the American West, Powell warned long ago of the dangers economic exploitation would pose to the West and spent a good deal of his life overcoming Washington politics in getting his message across. Only now, we may recognize just how accurate a prophet he was.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/99/43/9780140159943.jpg", "title_long": "Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.7 Inches, Length: 5.11 Inches, Weight: 0.72532084198 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.11}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.85}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.72532084198}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.7}}, "pages": 496, "date_published": "1992-03-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Scientists', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'History', 'Americas', 'Native American', 'World', 'Expeditions & Discoveries', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Wallace Stegner'], 'title": "Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West", "isbn13": "9780140159943", "msrp": 18, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101075856"}, "isbn": "0140159940", "isbn10": "0140159940", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101075852", "binding": "print"}]}}
