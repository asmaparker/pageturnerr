{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "Morgan is bored with his life. Nothing exciting ever happens in his house. He can calculate his parents' daily routine to the exact minute. He feels old before his time, with nothing to look forward to but more boredom.<br/>Then one dreary Sunday, Morgan has a vision of a magnificent fish, a leaping marlin wild in the sea, a creature so free that it would rather die than be tamed. The dream (if dream it is) is so vivid, Morgan feels a shocking rush of strength and speed racing through his veins, smells the salt air, and tastes the electricity of an impending ocean storm. For one brief exhilarating moment, sitting in a cramped apartment on a city block where every building looks exactly like the next, Morgan is that marlin, and from that moment on, he begins to change.<br/>A comic Metamorphosis for kids, this poignant, gently humorous, and highly original tale by actor, playwright, and first-time novelist James DeVita is a tender testament to following one's heart. Through a series of miraculous and sometimes ridiculous events, Morgan comes to understand that he has the power to be whatever he wants to be -- even a fish -- as long as he believes in himself.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/62/9780060295462.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blue', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.06 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.06}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2001-04-10', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Fish', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic'], 'authors': ['James DeVita'], 'title': 'Blue', 'isbn13': '9780060295462', 'msrp': 15.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0060295465', 'isbn10': '0060295465'}}
