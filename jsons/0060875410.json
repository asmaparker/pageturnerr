{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Wouldn't you love to abolish the IRS ...<br/>Keep all the money in your paycheck ...<br/>Pay taxes on what you spend, not what you earn ...<br/>And eliminate all the fraud, hassle, and waste of our current system?<br/>Then the FairTax is for you. In the face of the outlandish American tax burden, talk-radio firebrand Neal Boortz and Congressman John Linder are leading the charge to phase out our current, unfair system and enact the FairTax Plan, replacing the federal income tax and withholding system with a simple 23 percent retail sales tax on new goods and services. This dramatic revision of the current system, which would eliminate the reviled IRS, has already caught fire in the American heartland, with more than six hundred thousand taxpayers signing on in support of the plan.<br/>As Boortz and Linder reveal in this first book on the FairTax, this radical but eminently sensible plan would end the annual national nightmare of filing income tax returns, while at the same time enlarging the federal tax base by collecting sales tax from every retail consumer in the country. The FairTax, they argue, would transform the fearsome bureaucracy of the IRS into a more transparent, accountable, and equitable tax collection system. Among other benefits, it will: Make America's tax code truly voluntary, without reducing revenue Replace today's indecipherable tax code with one simple sales tax Protect lower-income Americans by covering the tax on basic necessities Eliminate billions of dollars in embedded taxes we don't even know we're paying Bring offshore corporate dollars back into the U.S. economy<br/>Endorsed by scores of leading economists and supported by a huge and growing grassroots movement, the FairTax Plan could revolutionize the way America pays for itself. In this straight-talking book, Neal Boortz and John Linder show you how it would workâ€”and how you can help make it happen.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/11/9780060875411.jpg', 'title_long': 'The FairTax Book', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2005-08-02', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic Policy & Development', 'Accounting', 'Taxation', 'Personal', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'United States', 'Public Affairs & Policy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Neal Boortz', 'John Linder'], 'title': 'The FairTax Book', 'isbn13': '9780060875411', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060875410', 'isbn10': '0060875410'}}
