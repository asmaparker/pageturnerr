{'book': {'publisher': 'Potomac Books Inc', 'synopsis': "Hussein Sumaida, the son of one of Saddam Hussein's principal lieutenants, was a member of the Iraqi elite. Underlying that privilege, however, was the cruelty of Ba'th Party members who used propaganda, torture, and murder to turn Iraq into a police state. Appalled, Sumaida began to work for Israeli intelligence, but he was soon discovered and awaited the worst. Surprisingly, Saddam spared his life in an unprecedented act of loyalty to Sumaida's father and put him to work as an Iraqi spy. Thus was the author drawn even deeper into Saddam's vicious system, into the circle of fear.<br/>Hussein Sumaida's compelling story takes the reader inside the bizarre inner workings of Iraqi society and the Iraqi intelligence service, and offers a unique firsthand look at Saddam Hussein's brutal rule. Sumaida's escape from the Ba'th dictatorship is the stuff of the best spy thrillers.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/97/9780028810997.jpg', 'title_long': 'Circle of Fear: My Life As an Israeli and Iraqi Spy', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '1994', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics'], 'authors': ['Hussein Sumaida', 'Carole Jerome'], 'title': 'Circle of Fear: My Life As an Israeli and Iraqi Spy', 'isbn13': '9780028810997', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0028810996', 'isbn10': '0028810996'}}
