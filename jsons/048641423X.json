{"book": {"publisher": "Dover Publications", "synopsis": "Although Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) created a wide range of poetry, essays, and fairy tales (and one novel) in his brief, tragic life, he is perhaps best known as a dramatist. His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.<br/>An Ideal Husband revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards — providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.<br/>Like most of Wilde"s plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895 debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years later. An Ideal Husband is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless sophistication.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/32/9780486414232.jpg", "title_long": "An Ideal Husband (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)", "edition": "Unabridged", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.14991433816 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.14991433816}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 96, "date_published": "2001-02-05", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Parodies', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'United States', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Oscar Wilde'], 'title": "An Ideal Husband (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)", "isbn13": "9780486414232", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0486131203", "eBook": "0486131203", "ePub": "0486131203"}, "isbn": "048641423X", "isbn10": "048641423X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780486131207", "binding": "print"}]}}
