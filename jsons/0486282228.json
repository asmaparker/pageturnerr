{"book": {"publisher": "Dover Publications", "synopsis": "One of George Bernard Shaw"s best-known plays, Pygmalion was a rousing success on the London and New York stages, an entertaining motion picture and a great hit with its musical version, My Fair Lady. An updated and considerably revised version of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, the 20th-century story pokes fun at the antiquated British class system.<br/>In Shaw"s clever adaptation, Professor Henry Higgins, a linguistic expert, takes on a bet that he can transform an awkward cockney flower seller into a refined young lady simply by polishing her manners and changing the way she speaks. In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.<br/>The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw"s brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made Pygmalion one of the most popular comedies in the English language. A staple of college drama courses, it is still widely performed.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/20/9780486282220.jpg", "title_long": "Pygmalion (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.18 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.18}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 96, "date_published": "1994-10-20", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'British & Irish'], 'authors": ["George Bernard Shaw'], 'title": "Pygmalion (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)", "isbn13": "9780486282220", "msrp": 3, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0486113787", "ePub": "0486113787"}, "isbn": "0486282228", "isbn10": "0486282228", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780486113784", "binding": "fpid13alias"}]}}
