{'book': {'publisher': 'Saunders College Pub', 'synopsis': "Briefer than competing majors texts, Arms and Camp focuses on developing a student's understanding of the basic principles of biology and preparing them for future coursework. This edition uses a problem-solving and experimental approach and de-emphasizes biological jargon in favour of communicating ideas and principles. * How do we know? boxes focus on the experimental aspects of biology and the scientific process showing students how biological information is obtained through specific problem-solving methods and investigative techniques. * Symbiosis is introduced as a major theme of evolution to balance the coverage of competition/predation as evolutionary forces and strategies. * Highly praised pedagogy includes learning objectives, self-quizzes, numerous tables, and discussion questions. Key concepts near the beginning of each chapter and concept summaried at the end of each chapter set students' priorities in approaching and reviewing the material. * Illustrated tables help students visualize description of biological features and facts. New to this * This edition features new material on genetics, cell biology, plant biology, and extensive new material", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/39/9780030500039.jpg', 'title_long': 'Biology, Fourth Edition', 'edition': '4', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.5 Inches, Length: 9.5 Inches, Weight: 5.78052050964 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 5.78052050964}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.5}}, 'pages': 1108, 'date_published': '1995', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Karen Arms'], 'title': 'Biology, Fourth Edition', 'isbn13': '9780030500039', 'msrp': 176.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0030500036', 'isbn10': '0030500036'}}
