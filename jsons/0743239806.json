{"book": {"publisher": "Scribner", "synopsis": "A reissue of the breath-taking sequel to CATCH-22 - now a classic in its own right. Forty-two years ago Joseph Heller wrote the 20th century masterpiece CATCH-22, capturing the hilarious and tragic insanity of the times and galvanising the conscience of a generation. In the sequel, CLOSING TIME, he revisits many of the characters - now older, if not wiser - that made CATCH-22 so unforgettable: Yossarian, Milo Minderbinder, Chaplain Tappman, Sammy Singer and giant Lew, all linked in uneasy peace and old age, fighting not the Germans this time, but The End. CLOSING TIME is a stunning achievement; a chilling, darkly funny depiction of the moral collapse of the Western world.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/06/9780743239806.jpg", "title_long": "Closing Time", "edition": "New edition", "dimensions": "Height: 198 Centimeters, Weight: 0.69225150268 Pounds, Width: 126 Centimeters", "dimensions_structured": {'width": {"unit": "centimeters", "value": 126}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.69225150268}, "height": {"unit": "centimeters", "value": 198}}, "pages": 464, "date_published": "2003", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ['Joseph Heller'], 'title": "Closing Time", "isbn13": "9780743239806", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0743239806", "isbn10": "0743239806"}}
