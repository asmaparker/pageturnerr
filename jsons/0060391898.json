{'book': {'publisher': 'Harpercollins', 'synopsis': "Food has always been a pleasure and a curse for 26-year-old Frannie and the women of her family. Raised by a mother obsessed with the ritual of dieting, a woman seemingly more in love with food than with her daughters, Frannie and her younger sister, Shelly, have undergone a lifetime of fat camps and Weight Watchers programs and have experienced the sugar high of consuming a box of Girl Scout cookies, the illicit thrill of midnight binges, and the triumph of fitting into a pair of size 6 jeans. Frannie's family acts as if this fascination with food is normal, until Shelly takes dieting too seriously and descends into the nightmare of a life-threatening eating disorder.<br/>With devastating insight, Jillian Medoff looks deep into the heart of an American family and emerges with a first novel that is at once heartbreakingly honest, wickedly funny, and wonderfully life-affirming: a warm, witty, and perceptive look at a tough yet tender young woman struggling to understand a younger sister battling anorexia and bulimia, bewildered parents who have grown apart, and her own despair at ever finding the right job, boyfriend, or place of her own.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/98/9780060391898.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hunger Point: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.6314207388 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.6314207388}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Jillian Medoff'], 'title': 'Hunger Point: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060391898', 'msrp': 24, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060391898', 'isbn10': '0060391898'}}
