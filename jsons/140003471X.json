Just hours after marrying the beautiful Angela Vicario, everyone agrees, Bayardo San Roman returned his bride in disgrace to her parents. Her distraught family forced her to name her first lover; and her twin brothers announced their intention to murder Santiago Nasar for dishonoring their sister.<br/><br/>Yet if everyone knew the murder was going to happen, why did no one intervene to stop it? The more that is learned, the less is understood, as the story races to its inexplicable conclusion.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/10/9781400034710.jpg", "title_long": "Chronicle of a Death Foretold", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.28 Pounds, Width: 0.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.28}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2003-10-07", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'World Literature', 'Caribbean & Latin American', 'United States', 'Hispanic', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Magical Realism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Gabriel García Márquez'], 'title": "Chronicle of a Death Foretold", "isbn13": "9781400034710", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "140003471X", "isbn10": "140003471X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101911105", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
