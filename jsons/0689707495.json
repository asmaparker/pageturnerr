{"book": {"publisher": "Atheneum Books for Young Readers", "synopsis": "An imaginative story of amazing food weather that inspired the hit movie, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a favorite of grown-ups and children everywhere.<br/><br/>The tiny town of Chewandswallow was very much like any other tiny townâ€”except for its weather which came three times a day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br/><br/>But it never rained rain and it never snowed snow and it never blew just wind. It rained things like soup and juice. It snowed things like mashed potatoes. And sometimes the wind blew in storms of hamburgers.<br/><br/>Life for the townspeople was delicious until the weather took a turn for the worse. The food got larger and larger and so did the portions. Chewandswallow was plagued by damaging floods and storms of huge food. The town was a mess and the people feared for their lives.<br/><br/>Something had to be done, and in a hurry.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/90/9780689707490.jpg", "title_long": "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 9.75 Inches, Weight: 0.20502990366 Pounds, Width: 0.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.20502990366}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 32, "date_published": "1982-04-01", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Judi Barrett'], 'title": "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs", "isbn13": "9780689707490", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0689707495", "isbn10": "0689707495"}}
