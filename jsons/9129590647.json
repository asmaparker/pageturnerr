{'book': {'publisher': 'R & S Books', 'synopsis': "Linnea loves plants. She grows them all over her room - in pots, and crates, even in glass jars.<br/>In this book, she takes you on a tour of her indoor garden. She tells you about her orange tree (and plantable pits and seeds, including melons, tomatoes, and grapes); she shows you how to take a cutting from a Busy Lizzie and how to trim an avocado plant.<br/><br/>And she teaches you what keeps plants satisfied: the art of watering properly (plants don't like standing with their feet in water) and fertilizing. And what to do when plants are attacked by whiteflies or other nasty bugs.<br/><br/>Linnea also makes garden-cress cheese (from homegrown cress, of course); discusses the pleasures and possible pitfalls of growing an amaryllis; and writes a plant newspaper, The Green Gazette.<br/><br/>Linnea's Windowsill Garden will informs and inspire anyone who wants to grow an indoor garden of their own.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/47/9789129590647.jpg', 'title_long': "Linnea's Windowsill Garden", 'edition': 'Ex-library/first U.S. Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 60, 'date_published': '1989', 'subjects': ["Children's Books"], 'authors': ['Christina Bjork'], 'title': "Linnea's Windowsill Garden", 'isbn13': '9789129590647', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '9129590647', 'isbn10': '9129590647'}}
