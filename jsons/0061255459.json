{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTeen', 'synopsis': "Kate Tapert sees her life in paintings. She makes sense of the world around her by relating it to what she adoresâ€”art. Armed with a suitcase, some canvases, and a scholarship to art school in Detroit, Kate is ready to leave home and fully immerse herself in painting. Sounds like heaven. All Kate needs is a place to stay.<br/>That place is the home of her father, famous and reclusive artist Dalton Quinn, a father she hasn't seen or heard from in nearly ten years. When Kate knocks on his door out of the blue, little does she realize what a life-altering move that will turn out to be. But Kate has a dream, and she will work her way into Dalton's life, into his mind, into his heart . . . whether he likes it or not.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/58/9780061255458.jpg', 'title_long': 'See What I See', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.77}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2010-12-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors': ['Gloria Whelan'], 'title': 'See What I See', 'isbn13': '9780061255458', 'msrp': 13.05, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061255459', 'isbn10': '0061255459'}}
