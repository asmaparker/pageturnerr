They have made their homes beneath the floorboards for generations and no longer remember—or even believe in—life beyond the Store walls.<br/>Until the day a small band of nomes arrives at the Store from the Outside. Led by a young nome named Masklin, the Outsiders carry a mysterious black box (called the Thing), and they deliver devastating news: In twenty-one days, the Store will be destroyed.<br/>Now all the nomes must learn to work together, and they must learn to think -- and to think BIG.<br/>Part satire, part parable, and part adventure story par excellence, master storyteller Terry Pratchett’s engaging trilogy traces the nomes’ flight and search for safety, a search that leads them to discover their own astonishing origins and takes them beyond their wildest dreams.<br/>Praise for the Bromeliad trilogy: “Witty, funny, wise, and altogether delightful.”—Locus Magazine<br/>Meet more of Sir Terry Pratchett’s tiny-but-fierce heroes in the Discworld novel The Wee Free Men!", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/49/66/9780060094966.jpg", "title_long": "The Bromeliad Trilogy: Truckers", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 7.62 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.435 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.58}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.435}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.62}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "2004-04-13", "subjects": ["Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Humorous', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors": ['Terry Pratchett'], 'title": "The Bromeliad Trilogy: Truckers", "isbn13": "9780060094966", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060094966", "isbn10": "0060094966"}}
