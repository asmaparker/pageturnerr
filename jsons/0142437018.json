Now penniless and banished to a room in the attic, Sara is demeaned, abused, and forced to work as a servant. How this resourceful girl\'s fortunes change again is at the center of A Little Princess, one of the best-loved stories in all of children\'s literature.<br/><br/>This unique and fully annotated edition appends excerpts from Frances Hodgson Burnett\'s original 1888 novella Sara Crewe and the stage play that preceded the novel, as well as an early story,
        "Behind the White Brick," allowing readers to see how A Little Princess evolved. In his delightful introduction, U. C. Knoepflmacher considers the fairy-tale allusions and literary touchstones that place the book among the major works of Victorian literature, and shows it to be an exceptionally rich and resonant novel.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/70/18/9780142437018.jpg", "title_long": "A Little Princess (Penguin Classics)", "dimensions": "Height: 0.54 Inches, Length: 7.76 Inches, Weight: 0.4739938633 Pounds, Width: 5.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.76}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4739938633}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.54}}, "pages": 242, "date_published": "2002-02-26", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Frances Hodgson Burnett'], 'title": "A Little Princess (Penguin Classics)", "isbn13": "9780142437018", "msrp": 10, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0142437018", "isbn10": "0142437018", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780698167865", "binding": "print"}]}}
