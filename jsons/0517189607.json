{"book": {"publisher": "Children"s Classics", "synopsis": "The Secret Garden, a classic loved for more than seventy-five years, is all that its title implies. It is, as one might imagine, a mystery.

It is a story of the love of nature, of science and the scientific method, and of isolated and lonely human beings who learn to care not only for others, but equally important, for themselves.
