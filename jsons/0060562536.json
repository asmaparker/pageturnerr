Her exasperated father has informed her that if she can’t find a husband by the end of her third London season, she will be forced to marry a man she hates—the ruthless entrepreneur Matthew Swift.<br/>Daisy is horrified. A Bowman never admits defeat, so she decides to do whatever it takes to marry someone . . . anyone . . . other than Matthew. What she doesn’t count on, however, is Matthew’s unexpected charm, or the blazing sensuality that soon flares beyond both their control. And Daisy discovers that the man she has always hated just might turn out to be the man of her dreams.<br/>But when a scandalous secret is uncovered, it could destroy both Matthew and a love more passionate and irresistible than Daisy’s wildest fantasies.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/33/9780060562533.jpg', 'title_long': 'Scandal in Spring (The Wallflowers, Book 4)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2016-03-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Victorian', 'Regency', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Lisa Kleypas'], 'title': 'Scandal in Spring (The Wallflowers, Book 4)', 'isbn13': '9780060562533', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061793167'}, 'isbn': '0060562536', 'isbn10': '0060562536', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061793165', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
