But, D. J. can’t help admitting, maybe he’s right.<br/>When you don’t talk, there’s a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said.<br/>Stuff like why her best friend, Amber, isn’t so friendly anymore. Or why her little brother, Curtis, never opens his mouth. Why her mom has two jobs and a big secret. Why her college-football-star brothers won’t even call home. Why her dad would go ballistic if she tried out for the high school football team herself. And why Brian is so, so out of her league.<br/>When you don’t talk, there’s a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said.<br/>Welcome to the summer that fifteen-year-old D. J.
