{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Abigail Timberlake Washburn, petite but feisty proprietor of Charleston's Den of Antiquity antiques shop, stopped speaking to best friend and temporary decorating partner Wynnell Crawford a month ago -- after questioning her choice of a cheap, three-foot-high replica of Michaelangelo's David to adorn the garden of a local bed-and-breakfast. But now Wynnell has broken the silence with one phone call ... from prison! It seems the b&b owner has been fatally beaned -- allegedly by the same tacky statue -- and Wynnell's been fingered by the cops for the bashing. But Abby suspects there's more to this well-sculpted slaying than initially meets the eye, and she wants to take a closer look at the not-so-bereaved widower and the two very odd couples presently guesting at the hostelry. Because if bad taste was a capital crime, Wynnell would be guilty as sin -- but she's certainly no killer!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/48/9780060535148.jpg', 'title_long': 'Statue of Limitations (Den of Antiquity)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-05-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Tamar Myers'], 'title': 'Statue of Limitations (Den of Antiquity)', 'isbn13': '9780060535148', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061865265'}, 'isbn': '0060535148', 'isbn10': '0060535148', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061865268', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
