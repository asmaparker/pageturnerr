{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': "The theory and application of structural analysis are presented as it applies to trusses, beams, and frames in this book/CD-ROM text. Emphasis is placed on developing the student's ability to both model and analyze a structure and on providing realistic applications encountered in professional practice. In each chapter, discussion of theory is followed by a summary of important concepts and a systematic approach for applying the theory. Example problems are solved using this method in order to clarify its numerical application. Chapter problems are given in sequential order of material covered, and arranged in order of difficulty. Classical methods of problem solving are emphasized over computerized matrix methods, but the CD-ROM supplies the STRAN computer program for checking answers to problems. Annotation c.
