{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': 'Who was this man who could walk through brick walls and, with a snap of his fingers, vanish elephants? In these pages you will meet the astonishing Houdiniâ€”magician, ghost chaser, daredevil, pioneer aviator, and king of escape artists. No jail cell or straitjacket could hold him! He shucked off handcuffs as easily as gloves.<br/>In this fresh, witty biography of the most famous bamboozler since Merlin, Sid Fleischman, a former professional magician, enriches his warm homage with insider information and unmaskings. Did Houdini really pick the jailhouse lock to let a fellow circus performer escape? Were his secrets really buried with him? Was he a bum magician, as some rivals claimed? How did he manage to be born in two cities, in two countries, on two continents at the same instant?<br/>Here are the stories of how a knockabout kid named Ehrich Weiss, the son of an impoverished rabbi, presto-changoed himself into the legendary Harry Houdini. Here, too, are rare photographs never before seen by the general reader!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/51/9780060850951.jpg', 'title_long': 'Escape!: The Story of the Great Houdini', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 1.7 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2006-08-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Action & Adventure', 'Biographies', 'Performing Arts'], 'authors': ['Sid Fleischman'], 'title': 'Escape!: The Story of the Great Houdini', 'isbn13': '9780060850951', 'msrp': 19.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0060850957', 'isbn10': '0060850957'}}
