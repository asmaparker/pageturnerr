{"book": {"publisher": "Dover Publications", "synopsis": ""Although we are amused, we may also be embarrassed to find our friends or even ourselves among the gullible advocates of plausible-sounding doubletalk." — Saturday Review<br/>"A very able and even-tempered presentation.' — New Yorker<br/>This witty and engaging book examines the various fads, fallacies, strange cults, and curious panaceas which at one time or another have masqueraded as science. Not just a collection of anecdotes but a fair, reasoned appraisal of eccentric theory, it is unique in recognizing the scientific, philosophic, and sociological-psychological implications of the wave of pseudoscientific theories which periodically besets the world.<br/>To this second revised edition of a work formerly titled In the Name of Science, Martin Gardner has added new, up-to-date material to an already impressive account of hundreds of systematized vagaries. Here you will find discussions of hollow-earth fanatics like Symmes; Velikovsky and wandering planets; Hörbiger, Bellamy, and the theory of multiple moons; Charles Fort and the Fortean Society; dowsing and the other strange methods for finding water, ores, and oil. Also covered are such topics as naturopathy, iridiagnosis, zone therapy, food fads; Wilhelm Reich and orgone sex energy; L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetics; A. Korzybski and General Semantics. A new examination of Bridey Murphy is included in this edition, along with a new section on bibliographic reference material.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/42/9780486203942.jpg", "title_long": "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (Popular Science)", "edition": "2nd Revised ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.8487787 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8487787}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "1957-06-01", "subjects": ["Science & Math', 'History & Philosophy'], 'authors": ["Martin Gardner'], 'title": "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (Popular Science)", "isbn13": "9780486203942", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "0486131629", "ePub": "0486131629"}, "isbn": "0486203948", "isbn10": "0486203948", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780486131627", "binding": "print"}]}}
