{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "Considered by many to be her masterpiece, Edith Wharton"s second full-length work is a scathing yet personal examination of the exploits and follies of the modern upper class. As she unfolds the story of Undine Spragg, from New York to Europe, Wharton affords us a detailed glimpse of what might be called the interior d√©cor of this America and its nouveau riche fringes. Through a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating, and through a most intricate and satisfying plot that follows Undine"s marriages and affairs, she conveys a vision of social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted. This edition features a new introduction and explanatory notes and reset text.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
