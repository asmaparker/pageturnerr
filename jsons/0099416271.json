{"book": {"publisher": "Random House", "synopsis": "This is Irving Stone\"s powerful and passionate biographical novel of Michelangelo. His time: the turbulent Renaissance, the years of poisoning princes, warring popes, the all-powerful Medici family, the fanatic monk Savonarola. His loves: the frail and lovely daughter of Lorenzo de Medici; the ardent mistress of Marco Aldovrandi; and his last love - his greatest love - the beautiful, unhappy Vittoria Colonna. His genius: a God-driven fury from which he wrested the greatest art the world has ever known. Michelangelo Buonarotti, creator of "David", painter of the Sistine ceiling, architect of the dome of St Peter\'s, lives once more in the tempestuous, powerful pages of Irving Stone\'s marvellous book.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/62/72/9780099416272.jpg", "title_long": "The Agony and the Ecstasy", "edition": "Re-issue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.3307 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 1.29921 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.3307}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.29921}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.89948602896}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.00786}}, "pages": 777, "date_published": "2001", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors": ['Irving Stone'], 'title": "The Agony and the Ecstasy", "isbn13": "9780099416272", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0099416271", "isbn10": "0099416271"}}
