{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "#4 on The New York Times’ list of The 50 Best Memoirs of the Past 50 Years<br/><br/>The New York Times bestselling, hilarious tale of a hardscrabble Texas childhood that Oprah.com calls the best memoir of a generation<br/><br/>“Wickedly funny and always movingly illuminating, thanks to kick-ass storytelling and a poet’s ear.” —Oprah.com<br/><br/>The Liars’ Club took the world by storm and raised the art of the memoir to an entirely new level, bringing about a dramatic revival of the form. Karr’s comic childhood in an east Texas oil town brings us characters as darkly hilarious as any of J. D. Salinger’s—a hard-drinking daddy, a sister who can talk down the sheriff at age twelve, and an oft-married mother whose accumulated secrets threaten to destroy them all. This unsentimental and profoundly moving account of an apocalyptic childhood is as “funny, lively, and un-put-downable” (USA Today) today as it ever was.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/49/9780143035749.jpg", "title_long": "The Liars" Club: A Memoir", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.94 Inches, Weight: 0.51147244784 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.94}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.64}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.51147244784}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2005-05-31", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Memoirs', 'Regional U.S.', 'South', 'History', 'Americas', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Mary Karr'], 'title": "The Liars" Club: A Memoir", 'isbn13": "9780143035749", "msrp": 12.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101650737"}, "isbn": "0143035746", "isbn10": "0143035746", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101650738", "binding": "print"}]}}
