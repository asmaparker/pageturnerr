{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'From the bestselling author of Jurassic Park, an epic tale of unspeakable horror<br/>The year is A.D. 922. A refined Arab courtier, representative of the powerful Caliph of Baghdad, encounters a party of Viking warriors who are journeying to the barbaric North. He is appalled by their Viking customs—the wanton sexuality of their pale, angular women, their disregard for cleanliness . . . their cold-blooded human sacrifices. But it is not until they reach the depths of the Northland that the courtier learns the horrifying and inescapable truth: he has been enlisted by these savage, inscrutable warriors to help combat a terror that plagues them—a monstrosity that emerges under cover of night to slaughter the Vikings and devour their flesh . . .<br/>“Crichton knows how to craft a tale, one that keeps the reader turning the pages.”—Houston Chronicle<br/>“Michael Crichton is one of our most gifted popular novelists. A true son of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. . . . A master of plausible and frightening scenarios. . . . He is a connoisseur of catastrophe.”—Los Angeles Times', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/65/9780060891565.jpg', 'title_long': 'Eaters of the Dead', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006-08-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Michael Crichton'], 'title': 'Eaters of the Dead', 'isbn13': '9780060891565', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060891564', 'isbn10': '0060891564'}}
