{"book": {"publisher": "Random House Books for Young Readers", "synopsis": "When a strange egg appears in their nest, Mr. and Mrs. Bird kindly take it upon themselves to raise the "baby bird" inside. But when the egg hatches, the Birds are in for a big surprise—"Junior' is the oddest-looking baby bird they\'ve ever seen—with big, long jaws full of teeth and an appetite to match. In fact, he looks more like a baby alligator than a baby bird! Nevertheless, the devoted Birds run themselves ragged feeding Junior until he gets so big, he must leave the nest or it will collapse underneath him. But how can Junior fly without wings? To the delight of the Birds—and readers!—the dilemma is solved when Junior takes off from a branch overlooking a pond.<br/><br/>Beginner Books are fun, funny, and easy to read! Launched by Dr. Seuss in 1957 with the publication of The Cat in the Hat, this beloved early reader series motivates children to read on their own by using simple words with illustrations that give clues to their meaning. Featuring a combination of kid appeal, supportive vocabulary, and bright, cheerful art, Beginner Books will encourage a love of reading in children ages 3–7.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/30/9780375802430.jpg", "title_long": "Flap Your Wings (Beginner Books(R))", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.34 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.34}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.50044933474}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 48, "date_published": "2000-01-25", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Animals', 'Birds', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Chapter Books & Readers', 'Education & Reference', 'Humor', 'Early Learning', 'Beginner Readers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["P.D.
