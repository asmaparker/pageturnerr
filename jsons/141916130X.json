{"book": {"publisher": "Kessinger Publishing, LLC", "synopsis": "The Art of Controversy is a collection of essays written by the renowned German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. In this book, Schopenhauer explores the nature of argumentation and debate, offering insights into how to effectively engage in intellectual disputes. He covers a wide range of topics, from logical fallacies and rhetorical techniques to the psychology of persuasion and the importance of intellectual honesty. Throughout the essays, Schopenhauer"s wit and sharp intellect are on full display as he dissects common argumentative tactics and offers strategies for overcoming them. The Art of Controversy is a fascinating and insightful read for anyone interested in the art of debate and the complexities of human communication.Speech and the communication of thought, which, in their mutual relations, are always attended by a slight impulse on the part of the will, are almost a physical necessity. Sometimes, however, the lower animals entertain me much more than the average man. For, in the first place, what can such a man say? It is only conceptions, that is, the driest of ideas, that can be communicated by means of words; and what sort of conceptions has the average man to communicate, if he does not merely tell a story or give a report, neither of which makes conversation?This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world"s literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/08/9781419161308.jpg", "title_long": "The Art Of Controversy: The Essays Of Arthur Schopenhauer", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25195 Inches, Length: 7.51967 Inches, Weight: 0.32628414776 Pounds, Width: 0.15748 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.51967}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.15748}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.32628414776}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25195}}, "pages": 76, "date_published": "2004-06-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays'], 'authors": ["Arthur Schopenhauer'], 'title": "The Art Of Controversy: The Essays Of Arthur Schopenhauer", "isbn13": "9781419161308", "msrp": 16.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "141916130X", "isbn10": "141916130X"}}
