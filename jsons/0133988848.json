{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': 'This book explores the field of experimental psychology from the standpoint of scientific methodology and methods of experimentation, rather than from specific content areas. There is a step-by-step process of effectively completing statistical analyses for major research designs used in behavioral research, and emphasizes the mutual facilitation of pure and applied research and the wise application of effective research methods to benefit society. Requires no previous background in statistics, develops a broad perspective about where sound psychological research fits within areas of public interest as well as more generally within science. This book gives special attention to ethics in human and animal research. It discusses the use of computers in psychology from historical and contemporary perspectives, and provides thorough guidance in the development of a research project from conception to written form.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/40/9780133988840.jpg', 'title_long': 'Experimental Psychology Methods of Research Methods of Research, Edition: 7', 'edition': 'seventh', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 1.1 Inches, Weight: 2.094391489 Pounds, Width: 7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.094391489}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 480, 'date_published': '1996', 'subjects': ['Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'General', 'Research', 'Sexuality'], 'authors': ['Frank J.
