{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperEntertainment', 'synopsis': 'A long time ago, when I was a young dancer in<br/>New York City, I fell in love with Jimmy Dean<br/>and he fell in love with me.<br/><br/>So begins this beguiling memoir of Liz "Dizzy" Sheridan\'s passionate yet ill-fated romance with the young, magnetic, soon-to-be-supernova James Dean. The year was 1951. Dean had recently arrived in Manhattan in search of Broadway stardom. Sheridan was a tall, graceful aspiring dancer. They met one rainy afternoon in the parlor of the Rehearsal Club, a chaperoned boardinghouse for young actresses -- and before long Dizzy and Jimmy were inseparable. Together they hunted for jobs, haunted all-night bars and diners, and gloried in the innocent rebellion of early-\'50s bohemian New York. Dizzy Sheridan and James Dean were lovers; they lived together; as even ardent Dean fans may be surprised to learn, they were engaged to be married. But when Dean began to find success on the Broadway stage and then was lured to Hollywood, the couple parted amid tears and broken dreams -- dreams that would be dashed forever when Dean died in a car crash in 1955, not long after seeing Dizzy for the last time.<br/>Dizzy & Jimmy marks the first time Liz Sheridan has written about this joyous yet ill-starred romance. She brings us closer than we have ever been to the vibrant young actor before he became a Hollywood icon, capturing his unstudied charm, his complicated psyche, the spontaneous delight he took from the world around him, and the passion he invested in his work and life. It is a journey that takes in many locales, from Dean\'s boyhood home in Fairmount, Indiana, to Sheridan\'s recuperative travels through the Caribbean after their breakup. But at its heart Dizzy & Jimmy is the story of a love affair with Manhattan -- of nights spent stealing kisses in Times Square, sharing a walkup in the Hargrave Hotel, dancing after hours beneath the stars in Grand Central Station. And in Sheridan\'s bittersweet, embraceable telling, it becomes a story no reader, Dean fan or otherwise, will soon forget.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/30/9780060393830.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dizzy & Jimmy: My Life with James Dean: A Love Story', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.881849048 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.881849048}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2000-09-19', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies'], 'authors': ['Liz Sheridan'], 'title': 'Dizzy & Jimmy: My Life with James Dean: A Love Story', 'isbn13': '9780060393830', 'msrp': 23, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060393831', 'isbn10': '0060393831'}}
