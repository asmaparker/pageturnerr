{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Pr', 'synopsis': 'Remote Sensing of Atmospheres and Oceans presents the technical proceedings of a workshop on the interpretation of remotely sensed data, held in Williamsburg, Virginia in May 1979. The main topic of the workshop is the interpretation and assessment of measurements acquired in remote sounding of different atmospheric and ocean parameters.The book contains 25 papers that cover the following remote sounding of atmospheric temperature; trace gases; precipitation and aerosols; sea surface temperature; ocean color; and winds. These papers are grouped into eight parts under major topics such as inversion methods, aerosol sounding, remote sounding, gaseous constituent retrievals, and interpretation of results from space.The text is a valuable source of information to students and professionals in the fields of atmospheric physics, applied science, meteorology, and engineering.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/07/9780122084607.jpg', 'title_long': 'Remote Sensing of Atmospheres and Oceans', 'edition': 1, 'dimensions': 'Weight: 2.01061582944 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.01061582944}}, 'pages': 641, 'date_published': '1980', 'subjects': ['Meteorology & Climatology', 'General', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Geology -> Mineralogy', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Physics -> General'], 'authors': ['Adarsh Deepak'], 'title': 'Remote Sensing of Atmospheres and Oceans', 'isbn13': '9780122084607', 'msrp': 72.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0122084608', 'isbn10': '0122084608', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780323143851', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
