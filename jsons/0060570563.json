{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Dive into the sometimes sexy, sometimes sinister, always hilarious world of love and action figures in the toy industry with Eugenie Seifer, the quirky, smart new author for Avon Trade.<br/>Toby Morris is 25 and ready for some excitement. Her job at a large toy company is long on stuffed animals, radio–controlled racers, and activity sets, but short on real satisfaction. When her former art school buddy lands a job at a local TV station and Toby tunes into the weekend news, she soon finds all the excitement she\'d ever asked for––through an infatuation with a young, handsome weatherman.<br/>As she slowly becomes obsessed with Doppler radar, storm trajectories, and cloud cover, Toby begins to send him anonymous poems ("if you like these poems/and the feelings I speak/please wear your green tie/on Thursday next week) and letters begin flying. It seems as though Toby has almost found her true love, until a botched prank leaves Toby wondering how she\'ll ever weather the storm. But what\'s coming up for Toby is something no weekend weatherman could ever predict.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/69/9780060570569.jpg', 'title_long': 'Babe in Toyland', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2004-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Eugenie Seifer Olson'], 'title': 'Babe in Toyland', 'isbn13': '9780060570569', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061738514'}, 'isbn': '0060570563', 'isbn10': '0060570563', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061738517', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
