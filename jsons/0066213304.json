{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': '“An important book and a spectacular public service. It opens a window onto the Catholic faith and will open the minds of believers and skeptics alike.” —Peggy Noonan<br/>The Catholic Church may be the most controversial institution in the world. Some find its teachings inexplicable, puzzling, even cruel. In this incisive new work, George Weigel suggests that we look at Catholicism and its controversies from “inside” the convictions that make those controversies not only possible, but necessary. The truths of Catholicism then come into clearer focus as affirmations and celebrations of human life and human love, even as they challenge us to imagine a daring future for humanity and for ourselves.<br/>Is Jesus uniquely the savior of the world? Is the moral life about rules or about happiness? Doesn’t suffering contradict the biblical claim that God is good? How does the Catholic Church think about other Christians and about other great world religions? In an engaging, accessible style, George Weigel leads us into the truth of Catholicism: the truth about a love that creates a vast, liberating terrain on which to live a fully human life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/09/9780066213309.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Truth of Catholicism: Ten Controversies Explored', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2001-10-23', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Catholicism', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Religious'], 'authors': ['George Weigel'], 'title': 'The Truth of Catholicism: Ten Controversies Explored', 'isbn13': '9780066213309', 'msrp': 24, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0066213304', 'isbn10': '0066213304'}}
