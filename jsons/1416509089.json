{"book": {"publisher": "Baen", "synopsis": "The battle between democracy and tyranny is joined, and the American Revolution has begun over a century ahead of schedule. A cosmic accident has shifted a modern West Virginia town back through time and space to land it and its twentieth century technology in Germany in the middle of the Thirty Years War. History must take a new course as American freedom and democracy battle against the squabbling despots of seventeenth-century Europe. Continuing the story begun in the hit novels 1632 and 1633, the New York Times best-selling creator of Honor Harrington, David Weber, the best-selling fantasy star Mercedes Lackey, best-selling SF and fantasy author Jane Lindskold, space adventure author K. D. Wentworth, Dave Freer, co-author of the hit novels Rats, Bats & Vats and Pyramid Scheme (both Baen), and Eric Flint himself combine their considerable talents in a shared-universe volume that will be a "must-have" for every reader of 1632 and 1633.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/80/9781416509080.jpg", "title_long": "Ring of Fire (The Ring of Fire)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.70106999316 Pounds, Width: 1.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.1875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.70106999316}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 722, "date_published": "2005-10-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Alternate History', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Time Travel'], 'authors": ["Davd Weber', 'Mercedes Lackey', 'K.
