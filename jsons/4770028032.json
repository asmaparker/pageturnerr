But it can take a long time to make friends and feel socially comfortable in a Japanese-speaking context, and there are few textbooks that can help.

You can tease a friend about their new relationship, talk about children or parents, vent anger or express sympathy. You can learn many different ways to thank a person or to respond to a compliment, and the specific attitude that each conveys.<br/><br/>All entries are defined and then amplified with two or three sample sentences. The naturalness of the sentences keeps the reading interesting, and makes it easier to gain not only passive understanding but the confidence to start using these phrases right away in conversation.<br/><br/>Impress your boss, charm your neighbor, apologize to a co-worker.
