Voyager ™ as Chakotay assumes command. Grief over Janeway"s impending death coupled with anxiety brought on by the disappearance of Paris, Kim, and the Doctor forces the crew to take increasingly dangerous actions in order to assure their own survival.<br/><br/>But Voyager doesn"t fight alone: behind the lines, powerful forces have allied to give the starship aid. Toward this end, a familiar nemesis -- the cosmic meddler Q -- sends Paris and Kim on a perilous journey. Elsewhere, the Doctor, trapped in a dimension alien to human understanding, reunites with an old friend to help secure the fates of those he"s left behind.<br/><br/>Yet the conflict raging in the Monorhan system is merely a surface manifestation of more serious turmoil; the true struggle is rooted in the universe's very foundation. Standing at the eye of this maelstrom is Voyager, whose crew may hold the fate of all.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/19/9781416507819.jpg", "title_long": "Star Trek: Voyager: String Theory #3: Evolution: Evolution", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.44974301448 Pounds, Width: 1.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.1875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44974301448}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "2006-03-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera', 'Military', 'Alien Invasion', 'Genetic Engineering', 'First Contact'], 'authors": ["Heather Jarman'], 'title": "Star Trek: Voyager: String Theory #3: Evolution: Evolution", "isbn13": "9781416507819", "msrp": 7.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "1416507817", "isbn10": "1416507817"}}
