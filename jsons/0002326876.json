{'book': {'publisher': 'Collins Crime', 'synopsis': '"When the body of retired Bolivian diplomat Guido Zavala is found floating in his swimming pool, Inspector Alvarez finds evidence that points to foul play. Though the Inspector would rather be sipping a brandy in the shade, he begins to look for suspects." "As Alvarez digs further into Zavala\'s past, he quickly uncovers a history of dubious acts that had left Zavala with numerous enemies - each with plenty of motive to see him dead. There is Jerome Robertson, whose beautiful and much younger wife had been involved in an affair with Zavala; Santiago Pons, a builder whose gambling debts had left him at Zavala\'s mercy; and Bailey, an honorable man who had suffered at the hands of Zavala." "The deeper he delves into the case, the more danger Alvarez finds himself in. After a series of phone calls that make it all too clear he could be the next victim, he appeals to Superior Chief Salas for help and is denied. Will Alvarez be able to weed through the long list of suspects before it\'s too late?"--BOOK JACKET.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/72/9780002326872.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Ambiguity of Murder (Inspector Alvarez Novel)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.8157103694 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8157103694}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '1999', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals'], 'authors': ['Roderic Jeffries'], 'title': 'The Ambiguity of Murder (Inspector Alvarez Novel)', 'isbn13': '9780002326872', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0002326876', 'isbn10': '0002326876'}}
