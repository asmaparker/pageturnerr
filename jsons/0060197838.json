{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Cookbooks', 'synopsis': "Ten years ago, Jonathan King and Jim Stott decided to cook up some homemade jams and sell them for extra money at a farmer's market. Those jams, along with a full line of chutneys, jellies, relishes, and other condiments, have grown into the renowned Stonewall Kitchen, whose products are now available in gift stores and specialty markets everywhere. But what to do with all these flavorful condiments besides spreading them on bread or crackers?<br/>The Stonewall Kitchen Cookbook serves up tantalizing ways to use their ever-expanding line of jams, chutneys, dessert toppings, savory mustards, relishes, and flavored oils. More than a cookbook, it's a new concept in cooking, teaching you how to use quality condiments in your everyday cooking (and you're not limited to Stonewall Kitchen products).<br/>This collection of 75 recipes boosts every cook's standards with a variety of delicious options. Techniques are simple. Ingredient lists are short. For example, weekend entertaining can still be elegant but a lot less complicated. Steamed sea bass is delicious served plain. Pair it with Roasted Red Pepper Sesame Sause and it becomes spectacular. Or simplify a restaurant classic by using Roasted Garlic Mustard to create Rack of Lamb with Mustard-Herb Crust. Dress up bowls of Corn-Crab Chowder with spoonfuls of spicy Corn Relish.<br/>Apply the same concepts to weeknight family fare. Spicy Linguine with Shrimp couldn't taste better or be easier than with Roasted Garlic Oil. Use Blackberry Sage Tea Jam to glaze roast chicken. Need some quick ideas to perk up vegetables? A splash of balsamic vinegar brings out the flavor in roasted beets. A fiery spice rub does wonders for Oven-Roasted Spiced Fries.<br/>And what meal is complete without dessert? Jams and preserves turn old standbys into uique interpretations. Try Stonewall Kitchen's version of Blueberry Ice Cream made with Wild Maine Blueberry Jam. Top Peach Melba Shortcakes with Raspberry Peach Champagne Jam for a new take.<br/>Make your cooking easier and better than ever with The Stonewall Kitchen Cookbook.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/34/9780060197834.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Stonewall Kitchen Cookbook', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.12 Inches, Length: 8.12 Inches, Weight: 1.65 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.12}}, 'pages': 164, 'date_published': '2001-04-03', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine'], 'authors': ['Jonathan King', 'Jim Stott'], 'title': 'The Stonewall Kitchen Cookbook', 'isbn13': '9780060197834', 'msrp': 28, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060197838', 'isbn10': '0060197838'}}
