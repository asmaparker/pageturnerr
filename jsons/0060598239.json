When the youngest was two and the oldest eighteen, Dad died and Mother bravely took over his business. Now, to keep the family together, everyone has to pitch in and pinch pennies. The resourceful clan rises to every crisis with a marvelous sense of fun—whether it's battling chicken pox, giving the boot to an unwelcome boyfriend, or even meeting the President. And the few distasteful things they can't overcome—like castor oil—they swallow with good humor and good grace.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/35/9780060598235.jpg', 'title_long': 'Belles on Their Toes', 'edition': '11/16/03', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.54}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2003-12-16', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Biographies', 'Social Issues', 'Family', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Frank B.
