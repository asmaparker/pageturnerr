{"book": {"publisher": "University of Pennsylvania Press", "synopsis": "The Penn Greek Drama Series presents original literary translations of the entire corpus of classical Greek drama: tragedies, comedies, and satyr plays. It is the only contemporary series of all the surviving work of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Menander.<br/>Aristophanes wrote most of his comedic masterpieces during the Peloponnesian War, parodying the tumultuous politics and society of that time with trademark innuendoes and bawdy stagings and dialogue. In these plays, Aristophanes brings every rhetorical strategem into play to treat the reader to stories of one man\"s attempt to create a "war-free zone," the rescue of the imprisoned Peace on the back of a giant dung beetle, a satire of Euripides\'s sympathies for women, and the hustling and healing of a blind and destitute Wealth in order to redistribute the world\'s riches.<br/>Translations are by Jack Flavin (Acharnians), Fred Beake (Peace), David Slavitt (Celebrating Ladies), and Palmer Bovie (Wealth). The volume includes an introduction by Ralph Rosen, Professor of Classics at the University of Pennsylvania.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/65/9780812234565.jpg", "title_long": "Aristophanes, 1: Acharnians, Peace, Celebrating Ladies, Wealth (Penn Greek Drama Series)", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3448197982 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.3448197982}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "1998-01-29", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'Ancient & Classical', 'Ancient & Medieval Literature', 'Greek'], 'authors": ["Aristophanes', 'David R.
