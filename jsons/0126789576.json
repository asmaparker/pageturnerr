{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': "This book stands as the first unified overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying higher-order learning and memory. It integrates modern discoveries concerning learning and memory disorders such as mental retardation syndromes and Alzheimer's Disease, while also emphasizing the results gained from the cutting-edge research methodologies of genetic engineering, complex behavioral characterization, proteomics, and molecular biology. This book provides a foundation of experimental design that will be useful to all students pursuing an interest in laboratory research. This book is an enlightening and invaluable resource for anyone concerned with memory mechanisms.<br/><br/>* Presents a unified view of memory mechanisms from behavior to genes and drawing examples from many different brain regions, types of learning, and various animal model systems* Includes numerous practical examples for the new investigator on how to implement research program in the area of learning and memory* Provides a balanced treatment of the strengths and weaknesses in modern experimental design", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/77/9780126789577.jpg', 'title_long': 'Mechanisms of Memory', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 2.12966545092 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.12966545092}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 424, 'date_published': '2003-10-30', 'subjects': ['Neuroscience', 'Mental Health', 'Molecular Biology', 'General', 'Cell Biology', 'Neurology', 'Genetics & Genomics', 'Allied Health & Medical -> Medical -> Neuroscience', 'Allied Health & Medical -> Medical -> General', 'Allied Health & Medical -> Medical -> Mental Health', 'Allied Health & Medical -> Medical -> Neurology', 'Allied Health & Medical -> Medical -> Psychiatry', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Genetics', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Molecular & Cell Biology'], 'authors': ['J.
