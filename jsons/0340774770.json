{"book": {"publisher": "Hodder Gibson", "synopsis": "This text has been written to accompany a popular option in the Intermediate History course. As the text is written for the Intermediate course, the approach is a source-based one, with progressive text and activities clearly differentiated in difficulty. Each chapter opens with a list of the main points to be covered, and contains numerous "What Do You Think?" sections, together with a range of primary and secondary source material. The end-of-chapter questions are pitched at both Intermediate 1 level (covering recall, evaluation and deriving data from sources) as well as Intermediate 2 extended-response questions. There is also a breakdown of how the exam is structured as well as ideas on how to tackle extended-response questions.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/79/9780340774779.jpg", "title_long": "The Road to War, 1933-39 (Hodder Intermediate History)", "dimensions": "Height: 10.82675 Inches, Length: 8.58266 Inches, Weight: 0.73634395508 Pounds, Width: 0.35433 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.58266}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.35433}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.73634395508}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.82675}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2000", "subjects": ["History', 'Europe', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching'], 'authors": ['Andrew Hunt'], 'title": "The Road to War, 1933-39 (Hodder Intermediate History)", "isbn13": "9780340774779", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0340774770", "isbn10": "0340774770"}}
