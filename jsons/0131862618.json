{"book": {"publisher": "Pi Press", "synopsis": "Robert Geroch builds on Einstein\"s work with commentary that addresses the ideas at the heart of the theory, bringing a modern understanding of relativity to the text. He elucidates how special relativity is a reconciliation of the contradictions between the nature of light and the principle of relativity; he expands on Einstein\"s treatment of the geometry of space-time and the fundamental notion of an "event'; he explains in detail, but without technical language, the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass, a cornerstone of general relativity.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/26/16/9780131862616.jpg", "title_long": "Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, The Masterpiece Science Edition,", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.54 Inches, Length: 5.52 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.52}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.13}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.54}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "2005-04-05", "subjects": ["Science & Math', 'Physics', 'Relativity', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Albert Einstein', 'Roger Penrose', 'Robert Geroch', 'David C.
