{"book": {"publisher": "NAL", "synopsis": "The revolutionary literary vision that sowed the seeds of Objectivism, Ayn Rand"s groundbreaking philosophy, and brought her immediate worldwide acclaim.<br/><br/>This modern classic is the story of intransigent young architect Howard Roark, whose integrity was as unyielding as granite...of Dominique Francon, the exquisitely beautiful woman who loved Roark passionately, but married his worst enemy...and of the fanatic denunciation unleashed by an enraged society against a great creator. As fresh today as it was then, Rand’s provocative novel presents one of the most challenging ideas in all of fiction—that man’s ego is the fountainhead of human progress...<br/><br/>“A writer of great power. She has a subtle and ingenious mind and the capacity of writing brilliantly, beautifully, bitterly...This is the only novel of ideas written by an American woman that I can recall.”—The New York Times", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/57/9780452286757.jpg", "title_long": "The Fountainhead (Centennial Edition HC)", "edition": "Centennial", "dimensions": "Height: 9.27 Inches, Length: 6.24 Inches, Weight: 2.41 Pounds, Width: 1.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.24}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.41}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.27}}, "pages": 752, "date_published": "2005-04-26", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Ayn Rand'], 'title": "The Fountainhead (Centennial Edition HC)", "isbn13": "9780452286757", "msrp": 39.95, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101137185", "ePub": "1101137185"}, "isbn": "0452286751", "isbn10": "0452286751", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101137185", "binding": "print"}]}}
