On Beauty is the story of an interracial family living in the university town of Wellington, Massachusetts, whose misadventures in the culture wars—on both sides of the Atlantic—serve to skewer everything from family life to political correctness to the combustive collision between the personal and the political. Full of dead-on wit and relentlessly funny, this tour de force confirms Zadie Smith\'s reputation as a major literary talent.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/43/9780143037743.jpg", "title_long": "On Beauty: A Novel", "edition": "First Thus", "dimensions": "Height: 1.1 Inches, Length: 8.4 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 5.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.95}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.1}}, "pages": 445, "date_published": "2006-08-29", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Zadie Smith'], 'title": "On Beauty: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780143037743", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0143037749", "isbn10": "0143037749", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101218112", "binding": "print"}]}}
