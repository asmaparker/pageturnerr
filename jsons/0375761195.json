{"book": {"publisher": "Modern Library", "synopsis": "Introduction and Notes by Robert Folkenflik<br/><br/>Rich in playful double entendres, digressions, formal oddities, and typographical experiments, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman provoked a literary sensation when it first appeared in England in a series of volumes from 1759 to 1767. An ingeniously structured novel (about writing a novel) that fascinates like a verbal game of chess, Tristram Shandy is the most protean and playful English novel of the eighteenth century and a celebration of the art of fiction; its inventiveness anticipates the work of Joyce, Rushdie, and Fuentes in our own century. This Modern Library Paperback is set from the nine-volume first edition from 1759.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/95/9780375761195.jpg", "title_long": "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (Modern Library Classics)", "edition": "NO-VALUE", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 1.51 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.51}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.6}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 704, "date_published": "2004-09-21", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'British & Irish', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Laurence Sterne'], 'title": "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (Modern Library Classics)", "isbn13": "9780375761195", "msrp": 11.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307432386", "ePub": "0307432386"}, "isbn": "0375761195", "isbn10": "0375761195", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307432384", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
