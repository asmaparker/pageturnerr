This sweeping chronicle of music, politics, drugs, fear, loathing, and faith is an indie rock classic in its own right.<br/><br/>The bands profiled include:<br/><br/>Sonic Youth Black Flag The Replacements Minutemen Husker Du Minor Threat Mission of Burma Butthole Surfers Big Black Fugazi Mudhoney Beat Happening Dinosaur Jr.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/36/9780316787536.jpg", "title_long": "Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981-1991", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.03837725402 Pounds, Width: 1.55 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.55}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.03837725402}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 528, "date_published": "2002-07-02", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'History & Criticism', 'Musical Genres', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Composers & Musicians', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Michael Azerrad'], 'title": "Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981-1991", "isbn13": "9780316787536", "msrp": 17, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0316787531", "isbn10": "0316787531"}}
