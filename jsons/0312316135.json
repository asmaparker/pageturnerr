{"book": {"publisher": "St. Martin"s Griffin", "synopsis": "Often scathingly funny, frequently tender, and always completely engaging, The Gatekeeper is Terry Eagleton"s memoirs, his deep-etched portraits of those who influenced him, either by example or by contrast: his father, headmasters, priests, and Cambridge dons. He was a shy, bookish, asthmatic boy keenly aware of social inferiority yet determined to make his intellectual way. The Gatekeeper mixes the soberly serious with the downright hilarious, skewer-sharp satire with unashamed fondness, the personal with the political. Most of it all it reveals a young man learning to reconcile oppositions: a double-edged portrait of the intellectual as a young man.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/36/9780312316136.jpg", "title_long": "The Gatekeeper: A Memoir", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.44974301448 Pounds, Width: 0.43 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.43}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44974301448}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2003-06-02", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Terry Eagleton'], 'title": "The Gatekeeper: A Memoir", "isbn13": "9780312316136", "msrp": 19.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312316135", "isbn10": "0312316135", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781466852440", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
