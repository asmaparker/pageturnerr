{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial", "synopsis": ""Chabon’s writing is deft and delicate — almost every page includes a delightful phrase or two. He mingles dialogue, the Pittsburgh cityscape, descriptions of the characters’ activity and Art’s thoughts and feelings to achieve that magical illusion good novels give — that the reader is living the character’s life with all its savors, jokes and pangs." — Boston Herald<br/>The New York Times bestseller debut that put Michael Chabon in the pantheon of great American novelists.<br/>The enthralling debut from bestselling novelist Michael Chabon is a penetrating narrative of complex friendships, father-son conflicts, and the awakening of a young man’s sexual identity. Chabon masterfully renders the funny, tender, and captivating first-person narrative of Art Bechstein, whose confusion and heartache echo the tones of literary forebears like The Catcher in the Rye’s Holden Caulfield and The Great Gatsby’s Nick Carraway. The Mysteries of Pittsburgh incontrovertibly established Chabon as a powerful force in contemporary fiction, even before his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay set the literary world spinning. An unforgettable story of coming of age in America, it is also an essential milestone in the movement of American fiction, from a novelist who has become one of the most important and enduring voices of this generation.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/05/92/9780060790592.jpg", "title_long": "The Mysteries Of Pittsburgh", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.72}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.52}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2005-07-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Biographical', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Michael Chabon'], 'title": "The Mysteries Of Pittsburgh", "isbn13": "9780060790592", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060790598", "isbn10": "0060790598"}}
