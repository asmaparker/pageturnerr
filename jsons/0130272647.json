{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': "This book presents topics in a simple, direct way that avoids “information overload,” and uses many worked examples to clarify principles while applying them to real-life. Designed to cover statics and strength of materials without knowledge of calculus, its chapter topics include resultant of concurrent forces in a plane; equilibrium of concurrent forces in a plane; resultant of nonconcurrent forces in a plane; equilibrium of a rigid body; force analysis of structures and machines; forces in space; friction; center of gravity, centroids, and moments of inertia of areas; strain for axial loads: Hooke's Law; shear forces and bending moments in beams; bending and shearing stresses in beams; deflection of beams due to bending; combined stresses and Mohr's Circle; columns; and bolted, riveted, and welded structural connections. An extensive list of professional organizations (including Websites)) supplies readers with sources for more information on material properties or recommended practices related to manufacturing and construction. For individuals preparing for a career in technical engineering.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/45/9780130272645.jpg', 'title_long': 'Statics and Strength of Materials (4th Edition)', 'edition': '4', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.48817 Inches, Length: 7.67715 Inches, Weight: 2.75357365238 Pounds, Width: 1.14173 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.67715}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.14173}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.75357365238}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.48817}}, 'pages': 720, 'date_published': '2000-07-21', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Civil & Environmental', 'Mechanical', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Morrowkokernak'], 'title': 'Statics and Strength of Materials (4th Edition)', 'isbn13': '9780130272645', 'msrp': 105, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0130272647', 'isbn10': '0130272647'}}
