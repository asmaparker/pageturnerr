{"book": {"publisher": "The New Press", "synopsis": "In this historic 1971 debate, two of the twentieth century’s most influential thinkers discuss whether there is such a thing as innate human nature.<br/><br/>In 1971, at the height of the Vietnam War and at a time of great political and social instability, two of the world’s leading intellectuals, Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault, were invited by Dutch philosopher Fons Elders to debate an age-old question: Is there such a thing as “innate” human nature independent of our experiences and external influences?<br/><br/>The resulting dialogue is one of the most original, provocative, and spontaneous exchanges to have occurred between contemporary philosophers. Above all, their discussion serves as a concise introduction to their two opposing theories. What begins as a philosophical argument rooted in linguistics (Chomsky) and the theory of knowledge (Foucault), soon evolves into a broader discussion encompassing a wide range of topics, from science, history, and behaviorism to creativity, freedom, and the struggle for justice in the realm of politics.<br/><br/>In addition to the debate itself, this volume features a newly written introduction by noted Foucault scholar John Rajchman and includes substantial additional texts by Chomsky and Foucault.<br/><br/>“[Chomsky is] arguably the most important intellectual alive.” ―The New York Times<br/><br/>“Foucault . . . leaves no reader untouched or unchanged.” ―Edward Said", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/41/9781595581341.jpg", "title_long": "The Chomsky-Foucault Debate: On Human Nature", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.26 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.26}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.65}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.56}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2006-09-18", "subjects": ["Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Applied Psychology', 'Reference', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Criticism', 'Logic & Language', 'Modern', 'Political', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science'], 'authors": ["Noam Chomsky', 'Michel Foucault'], 'title": "The Chomsky-Foucault Debate: On Human Nature", "isbn13": "9781595581341", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "1595586571"}, "isbn": "1595581340", "isbn10": "1595581340", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781595586575", "binding": "print"}]}}
