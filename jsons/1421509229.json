What common thread binds these three nations together? Answer: each is famous for producing unique, distinctive, delicious bread. But what about Japan, home to rice and delicacies of the sea? Is there not a doughy, gastronomic delight they can claim as their own? The answer is no...until now! Kazuma Azuma, a 16-year-old-boy blessed with otherworldly baking powers, has taken it upon himself to create Ja-pan, the national bread of the land of the rising sun!<br/><br/>The drama escalates in the third round of the Pantasia Rookie Tournament when Kazuma"s masked and muscle-bound opponent blows the judges away with his animal-themed bread in the shape of a magnificent dragon. Will Kazuma"s contribution, a cute green turtle, be delicious enough to throw the judges into a deadlock? And just how many half-sisters does Tsukino actually have?! Yet another turns up, this one unapologetically evil, and begins to stir up a little mischief!", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/28/9781421509228.jpg", "title_long": "Yakitate!!
