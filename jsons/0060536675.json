{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': '“By virtue of being smart, scathing, and verbally inventive to an astonishing degree, David J. Schow distinguished himself early on as one of the most interesting writers of his generation. In BULLETS OF RAIN, he has given us his boldest, most audacious fiction to date. Here, all of Schow’s glittering weapons are sharper than ever before.” — Peter Straub<br/>Elements of Panic Room collide with Memento in this dark and suspenseful novel from the screenwriter of The Crow.<br/>Recently widowed Arthur Latimer has become a recluse within the blueprint of his specially designed storm-proof home, fortressed in against his feelings of abandonment and loss. But his convenient, cocooned, and secure life falls under attack when he is inexorably magnetized to the bizarre weekend party taking place at a neighboring house down-beach from him.<br/>Suddenly Art begins to doubt everything he sees: Was the unannounced visit from an old friend a hallucination? Is he receiving messages from his dead wife in the form of bottles found in the sea? And shouldn’t he warn those oblivious partygoers about the incoming storm, the biggest hurricane ever to hit the Pacific Northwest?<br/>Art’s inner and outer realities are turned upside down; nothing is as it appears to be. And he is about to be plunged into a world more brutal and illusive anything he has ever imagined.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/71/9780060536671.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bullets of Rain: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.49 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 289, 'date_published': '2003-09-23', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', 'Friendship', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['David J.
