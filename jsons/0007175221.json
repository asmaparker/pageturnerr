{"book": {"publisher": "Harpercollins Childs", "synopsis": "This hilarious book will have children tying their tongues in knots as they try to read aloud the most terrible tongue twisters ever written. They"ll have so much fun they won"t even realise that they"re learning to read at the same time! With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr Suess has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic Cat in the Hat, and ranked among the UK's top ten favourite children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide. As part of a major rebrand programme, HarperCollins is relaunching Dr Seuss's best-selling books. In response to consumer demand, bright new cover designs incorporate much-needed guidance on reading levels. The standard paperbacks divide into three reading strands -- Blue Back Books for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. This is a Green Back book.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/52/22/9780007175222.jpg", "title_long": "Oh Say Can You Say?
