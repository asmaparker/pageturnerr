{"book": {"publisher": "Adv Manga", "synopsis": "Can an ordinary girl turn into the magical hero Pretear? In this volume, we find out what really happened 16 years ago, and why Hayate feels guilty about it. Another girl named Takako had been chosen to be the Pretear. She was scared and didn\"t want to fight, but she kept at it because she liked Hayate. When she told Hayate her feelings for him, Hayate refused her because as one of the Knights, he wasn\"t permitted to return her feelings. Takako\"s anger transformed her into the Princess of Disaster. This story makes Himeno even more determined, and during one battle, her desire to protect the land allows her to transform into the 'White Pretear.'', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/50/9781413901450.jpg", "title_long": "Pretear, Volume 2", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.39903669422 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39903669422}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 198, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga'], 'authors": ['Kaori Naruse', 'Junichi Satou'], 'title": "Pretear, Volume 2", "isbn13": "9781413901450", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "141390145X", "isbn10": "141390145X"}}
