{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage Books", "synopsis": "This new collection of short stories by the award-winning author of Waiting confirms Ha Jin"s reputation as a master storyteller, as well as a master of the miniature. In The Bridegroom, the twelve stories capture a China in transition, moving from Maoism towards a more open society. For these men and women, starting to feel the influence of the West, the daily dramas of a system that still struggles to control their every move and thought are made all the more painful by this. As his characters, from an entrepreneur, transformed from black-market criminal to free market hero, to the workers at Cowboy Chicken, to the professor mistaken by the police for a saboteur, continue to struggle against petty injustices and heartbreaks, Ha Jin celebrates their lives and humanity with the understated humour and simplicity that has won him widespread acclaim.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/21/74/9780099422174.jpg", "title_long": "The Bridegroom", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.37699046802 Pounds, Width: 0.59055 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.07873}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.59055}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.37699046802}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.79526}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2008", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories'], 'authors": ["Ha Jin'], 'title": "The Bridegroom", "isbn13": "9780099422174", "msrp": 14.45, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0099422174", "isbn10": "0099422174"}}
