{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books Ltd", "synopsis": "It is the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships\" cables and hawsers. A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it." So Melville wrote of his masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part, "Moby-Dick' is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author\'s lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, 'Moby-Dick' is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/27/9780140620627.jpg", "title_long": "Moby Dick (Penguin Popular Classics)", "dimensions": "Height: 7.12597 Inches, Length: 4.37007 Inches, Weight: 0.64374980504 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.37007}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7874}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.64374980504}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.12597}}, "pages": 544, "date_published": "1994-04-28", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Action & Adventure', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ['Herman Melville'], 'title": "Moby Dick (Penguin Popular Classics)", "isbn13": "9780140620627", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140620621", "isbn10": "0140620621"}}
