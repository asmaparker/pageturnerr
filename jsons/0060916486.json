{'book': {'publisher': 'Amistad', 'synopsis': '"Simply the most exciting book on black folklore and culture I have ever read." --Roger D. Abrahams<br/>Mules and Men is the first great collection of black America\'s folk world. In the 1930\'s, Zora Neale Hurston returned to her "native village" of Eatonville, Florida to record the oral histories, sermons and songs, dating back to the time of slavery, which she remembered hearing as a child. In her quest, she found herself and her history throughout these highly metaphorical folk-tales, "big old lies," and the lyrical language of song. With this collection, Zora Neale Hurston has come to reveal\'and preserve\'a beautiful and important part of American culture.<br/>Zora Neale Hurston (1901-1960) was a novelist, folklorist, anthropologist and playwright whose fictional and factual accounts of black heritage are unparalleled. She is also the author of Tell My Horse, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Dust Tracks on a Road, and Mule Bone.<br/>Ruby Dee, a member of the Theatre Hall of Fame, starred on Broadway in the original productions of A Raisin in the Sun and Purlie Victorious, and was featured in Spike Lee\'s Do the Right Thing.
