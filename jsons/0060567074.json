"You make this so much more difficult than it needs to be."<br/>So spank me, I\'m a lawyer and complicating things at a high hourly rate is my specialty.<br/>Sometimes being a lawyer is the pits. At least that\'s what Lilly Cleary thinks. Lilly is a tough-as-nails attorney (and an obsessive-compulsive health nut) who works for a big firm in Sarasota, Florida. Just when she\'s got her hands full with a psychic client and a Nazi next-door neighbor who keeps reporting her to the police, an obnoxious partner in her firm is murdered.<br/>When the loyal Bonita surfaces as a key suspect, Lilly jumps knee-deep into the murder investigation and encounters a world-class assortment of weirdo suspects -- all of whom had good reason to want to knock the guy off.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/71/9780060567071.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wildcat Wine: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2005-04-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors': ['Claire Matturro'], 'title': 'Wildcat Wine: A Novel of Suspense', 'isbn13': '9780060567071', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060567074', 'isbn10': '0060567074', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062133595', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
