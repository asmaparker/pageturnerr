{"book": {"publisher": "Everyman"s Library", "synopsis": "Introduction by Peter Washington; Translation by William Weaver<br/><br/>Italo Calvino’s masterpiece combines a love story and a detective story into an exhilarating allegory of reading, in which the reader of the book becomes the book’s central character.<br/><br/>Based on a witty analogy between the reader’s desire to finish the story and the lover’s desire to consummate his or her passion, IF ON A WINTER’S NIGHT A TRAVELER is the tale of two bemused readers whose attempts to reach the end of the same book—IF ON A WINTER’S NIGHT A TRAVELER, by Italo Calvino, of course—are constantly and comically frustrated. In between chasing missing chapters of the book, the hapless readers tangle with an international conspiracy, a rogue translator, an elusive novelist, a disintegrating publishing house, and several oppressive governments. The result is a literary labyrinth of storylines that interrupt one another—an Arabian Nights of the postmodern age.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/55/9780679420255.jpg", "title_long": "If on a Winter"s Night a Traveler: Introduction by Peter Washington (Everyman"s Library Contemporary Classics Series)', 'edition": "unknown", "dimensions": "Height: 8.29 Inches, Length: 5.19 Inches, Weight: 0.925 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.88}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.925}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.29}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "1993-06-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Italo Calvino'], 'title": "If on a Winter"s Night a Traveler: Introduction by Peter Washington (Everyman"s Library Contemporary Classics Series)', 'isbn13": "9780679420255", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0679420258", "isbn10": "0679420258"}}
