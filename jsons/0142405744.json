{"book": {"publisher": "Speak", "synopsis": "Music is Pete"s life. From playing in a jazz band to jamming at 2 AM with his guitar-playing dad, Pete is almost never without his bass. He"s sure his treasured Fender Precision bass, along with his vow never to be a sell-out, will lead him to a record deal one day.<br/>Then he meets the Carlisle brothers. They can"t sing and they can barely play their instruments, but somehow they have a following. And they desperately need a bass player. Pete can play circles around these amateurs, but there's a raw power to their sound that's surprisingly appealing. He can't resist, and he joins The Tiny Masters of Today. When the band gets a chance at real superstardom, Pete wonders if he's ready for the big leagues. He knows the quality of the music should come first... but who knew selling out could be so much fun? Blake Nelson's riveting novel shows the realities of life in a band, and all the temptations that come with it.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/57/41/9780142405741.jpg", "title_long": "Rock Star Superstar", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.06 Inches, Length: 4.26 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.26}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.61}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.06}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2006-04-06", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Boys & Men', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors": ["Blake Nelson'], 'title": "Rock Star Superstar", "isbn13": "9780142405741", "msrp": 6.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101157437"}, "isbn": "0142405744", "isbn10": "0142405744", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101157435", "binding": "print"}]}}
