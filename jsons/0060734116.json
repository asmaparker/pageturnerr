When she comes across a lost play by a dead 1980s icon -- brilliantly written, with the perfect role that will display her acting chops -- she thinks she's hit the jackpot.<br/>But when she becomes the play's de facto producer and lands a gig on an indie film, she's forced to deal with the nonstop whirlwind of backstage maneuverings and outrageous personalities ... and with the fact that she witnessed the falling of the Twin Towers from blocks away. When Hannah loses her coveted role to an old rival, she learns a shocking truth that could bring her whole world tumbling down.<br/>Dynamic and moving, with trademark Nersesian moments of cutting humor and truth, Unlubricated is a tale of down-and-dirty off-Broadway New York theatre, sex, love, and life in the wake of September 11.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/14/9780060734114.jpg', 'title_long': 'Unlubricated: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.69 Pounds, Width: 0.95 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.95}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.69}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 380, 'date_published': '2004-09-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'City Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Arthur Nersesian'], 'title': 'Unlubricated: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060734114', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060734116', 'isbn10': '0060734116'}}
