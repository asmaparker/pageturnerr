{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': 'Enjoy what you eat.<br/>From the author of the national bestseller The Culture of Fear comes a rallying cry to abandon food fads and myths for calmer and more pleasurable eating.<br/>For many Americans, eating is a religion. We worship at the temples of celebrity chefs. We raise our children to believe that certain foods are good and others are bad. We believe that if we eat the right foods, we will live longer, and if we eat in the right places, we will raise our social status. Yet what we believe to be true about food is, in fact, quite contradictory. Offering part expos√©, part social com-mentary, sociologist Barry Glassner talks to chefs, food chemists, nutritionists, and restaurant critics about the way we eat. Helping us recognize the myths, half-truths, and guilt trips they promulgate, The Gospel of Food liberates us for greater joy at the table.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/11/9780060501211.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Gospel of Food: Everything You Think You Know About Food Is Wrong', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2007-01-02', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diets & Weight Loss', 'Weight Loss', 'Other Diets', 'Nutrition', 'Macrobiotics', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Science & Math', 'Agricultural Sciences', 'Food Science', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Customs & Traditions', 'Sociology'], 'authors': ['Barry Glassner'], 'title': 'The Gospel of Food: Everything You Think You Know About Food Is Wrong', 'isbn13': '9780060501211', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060501219', 'isbn10': '0060501219'}}
