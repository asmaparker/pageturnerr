{'book': {'publisher': 'Princeton University Press', 'synopsis': 'As the largest flying bird of North America, and one of the most endangered, the California Condor has been a source of tremendous interest and awe. This book offers up-to-date information on both the biology and conservation of the condor, as analyzed by the two most knowledgeable field biologists to have studied the species. The authors present first a thorough review of the history of condor studies and conservation efforts, then a detailed examination of the biology and recent decline of the species, and finally a hopeful plan for ultimate restoration of the species as a viable member of wild ecosystems. The book is illustrated with over a hundred superb color photographs covering numerous aspects of natural history of the species and recent conservation efforts on its behalf. Conservation of the California Condor has always been highly controversial, and this book does not shrink from controversy. Instead it offers a broad and insightful, but nevertheless sympathetic treatment of the many political conflicts of the past century.<br/><br/>Key Features?<br/><br/>Reviews historical account of condor biology and conservation<br/>Analyzes nest site characteristics and limitations<br/>Studies breeding behavior and analyzes breeding effort and success<br/>Discusses mortality rates and the causes for their decline and efforts to improve reproduction<br/>Discusses the techniques, problems, and results of captive breeding and release programs', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/55/9780126540055.jpg', 'title_long': 'The California Condor: A Saga of Natural History and Conservation (Ap Natural World)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 4.15 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 4.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2000-05-20', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Ecology', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Natural History', 'Birdwatching', 'Conservation'], 'authors': ['Noel F.
