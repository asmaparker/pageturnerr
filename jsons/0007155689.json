{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Uk', 'synopsis': 'From Booklist<br/><br/>Host of The City Gardener, a British TV series, James lives in a London high-rise and he gardens on his balcony. His attractive book is intended to help beginners create gardens in small spaces. James writes that it is important first to evaluate the amount of sun and shade the site will get, then to work with the proper soil mixture. He offers advice on choosing the correct design and surface materials, on privacy and screening, on making use of levels, on picking garden furniture, and on creating a sense of tranquility. He recommends a variety of annuals and perennials and describes their colors, scents, and shapes, and demonstrates how some can be grown in pots and hanging baskets. Another fine feature: lovely color photographs appear throughout this helpful book. George Cohen<br/>Copyright Â© American Library Association.
