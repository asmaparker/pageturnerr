{'book': {'publisher': 'Amistad Books for Young Readers', 'synopsis': 'A classic memoir that\'s gripping, funny, and ultimately unforgettable from the bestselling former National Ambassador of Books for Young People. A strong choice for summer reading—an engaging and powerful autobiographical exploration of growing up a so-called "bad boy" in Harlem in the 1940s.<br/>As a boy, Myers was quick-tempered and physically strong, always ready for a fight. He also read voraciously—he would check out books from the library and carry them home, hidden in brown paper bags in order to avoid other boys\' teasing. He aspired to be a writer (and he eventually succeeded).<br/>But as his hope for a successful future diminished, the values he had been taught at home, in school, and in his community seemed worthless, and he turned to the streets and to his books for comfort.<br/>Don’t miss this memoir by New York Times bestselling author Walter Dean Myers, one of the most important voices of our time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/83/9780064472883.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bad Boy: A Memoir', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.39242282636 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.54}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.39242282636}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2020-05-12', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Biographies', 'Literary', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Boys & Men', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Social Issues', 'Peer Pressure', 'Historical Fiction', 'United States'], 'authors': ['Walter Dean Myers'], 'title': 'Bad Boy: A Memoir', 'isbn13': '9780064472883', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061974935'}, 'isbn': '0064472884', 'isbn10': '0064472884', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061974939', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
