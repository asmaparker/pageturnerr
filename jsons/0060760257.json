{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial", "synopsis": "A family without men, the Birches live gloriously offbeat lives in the lush, green backwoods of North Carolina. Radiant, headstrong Sophia and her shy, brilliant daughter, Margaret, possess powerful charms to ward off loneliness, despair, and the human misery that often beats a path to their door. And they are protected by the eccentric wisdom and muscular love of the remarkable matriarch Charlie Kate, a solid, uncompromising, self-taught healer who treats everything from boils to broken bones to broken hearts.<br/>Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate find strength in a time when women almost always depended on men, and their bond deepens as each one experiences love and loss during World War II. Charms for the Easy Life is a passionate, luminous, and exhilarating story about embracing what life has to offer ... even if it means finding it in unconventional ways. This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/02/50/9780060760250.jpg", "title_long": "Charms for the Easy Life", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.61}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.48}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2005-07-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', 'Women's Fiction', 'Domestic Life', 'Mothers & Children', 'United States', 'Southern', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Kaye Gibbons'], 'title": "Charms for the Easy Life", "isbn13": "9780060760250", "msrp": 13.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060760257", "isbn10": "0060760257"}}
