{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "Among the world's great cuisines, the foods of Mexico stand out in their diversity and creativity. Rooted in its history of great and ancient Indian civilizations, inspired by the Spanish Conquistadores of the sixteenth century, and influenced by European tastes in the later revolutionary years, it is indeed a dynamic cuisine -- adaptable but remarkably complete even in its melding of different cultures.<br/>In The Best of Mexico, food editor Evie Righter has chosen the finest examples of culinary creativity from this intriguing and vibrant country. From the chiles, chocolate, nuts, and tomatoes puréed into exquisite sauces, to the corn, beans, avocados, and seafood combined into flavorful dishes, she presents the Mexican cook's ingredients and techniques in a clear and accessible style that will enlighten and inspire.<br/>Here are the favorite drinks, salsas, and tacos; festive dishes including enchiladas, tamales, and pozoles; elegant entrées like Mole Poblano de Guajolote and Pescado a la Veracruzana, and well-loved desserts like Flan and Buñuelos.<br/>Color photographs throughout feature the dishes themselves as well as the bountiful waters and lively marketplaces so representative of Mexico. An essential guide to this distinctive cuisine, The Best of Mexico helps turn an ordinary meal into a fiesta.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/89/9780002551489.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Best of Mexico', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.46 Inches, Length: 7.08 Inches, Weight: 0.67461452172 Pounds, Width: 6.88 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.08}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.88}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.67461452172}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.46}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '1992-01-01', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Regional & International', 'Mexican'], 'authors': ['Evie Righter'], 'title': 'The Best of Mexico', 'isbn13': '9780002551489', 'msrp': 19.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0002551489', 'isbn10': '0002551489'}}
