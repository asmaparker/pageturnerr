{"book": {"publisher": "Gardners Books", "synopsis": "In 1940 Steinbeck sailed in a sardine boat with his great friend the marine biologist, Ed Ricketts, to collect marine invertebrates from the beaches of the Gulf of California. The expedition was described by the two men in "Sea Of Cortez", published in 1941. The day-to-day story of the trip is told here in the Log, which combines science, philosophy and high-spirited adventure. This book is an exhilarating and highly entertaining read.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/60/78/9780141186078.jpg", "title_long": "The Log from the "Sea of Cortez", 'edition": "New Ed", "dimensions": "Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.52029093832 Pounds, Width: 0.70866 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.07873}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.70866}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.52029093832}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.79526}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2000-12-31", "subjects": ["Travel'], 'authors": ["John Steinbeck'], 'title": "The Log from the "Sea of Cortez", 'isbn13": "9780141186078", "msrp": 19.5, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0141186070", "isbn10": "0141186070"}}
