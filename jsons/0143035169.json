{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "With the same sensitivity and artfulness that are the trademarks of her award-winning novels, Carol Shields explores the life of a writer whose own novels have engaged and delighted readers for the past two hundred years. In Jane Austen, Shields follows this superb and beloved novelist from her early family life in Steventown to her later years in Bath, her broken engagement, and her intense relationship with her sister Cassandra. She reveals both the very private woman and the acclaimed author behind the enduring classics Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma. With its fascinating insights into the writing process from an award–winning novelist, Carol Shields’s magnificent biography of Jane Austen is also a compelling meditation on how great fiction is created.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/69/9780143035169.jpg", "title_long": "Jane Austen: A Life (Penguin Lives)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 0.52 Inches, Length: 7.18 Inches, Weight: 0.31 Pounds, Width: 5.12 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.18}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.12}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.31}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.52}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2005-05-31", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Women Authors', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Women's Studies', 'Women Writers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Carol Shields'], 'title": "Jane Austen: A Life (Penguin Lives)", "isbn13": "9780143035169", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101099577"}, "isbn": "0143035169", "isbn10": "0143035169", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101099575", "binding": "print"}]}}
