{"book": {"publisher": "Dial Press Trade Paperback", "synopsis": "Workaholic attorney Samantha Sweeting has just done the unthinkable. She’s made a mistake so huge, it’ll wreck any chance of a partnership.<br/><br/>Going into utter meltdown, she walks out of her London office, gets on a train, and ends up in the middle of nowhere. Asking for directions at a big, beautiful house, she’s mistaken for an interviewee and finds herself being offered a job as housekeeper. Her employers have no idea they’ve hired a lawyer–and Samantha has no idea how to work the oven. She can’t sew on a button, bake a potato, or get the #@%# ironing board to open. How she takes a deep breath and begins to cope–and finds love–is a story as delicious as the bread she learns to bake.<br/><br/>But will her old life ever catch up with her? And if it does…will she want it back?", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/91/9780385338691.jpg", "title_long": "The Undomestic Goddess: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.15 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.71 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.71}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.15}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "2006-04-25", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Cooking', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Women's Fiction', 'Domestic Life', 'Friendship', 'Contemporary', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Sophie Kinsella'], 'title": "The Undomestic Goddess: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780385338691", "msrp": 17, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0385338694", "isbn10": "0385338694"}}
