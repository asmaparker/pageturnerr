{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Cookbooks', 'synopsis': "Love Asian food but too intimidated to make it at home? Do you find yourself flipping through an Asian cookbook, and then going out for Thai noodles or Korean Barbecue, rather than going into your kitchen? When Marnie Henricksson gave up her noodle shop in Greenwich Village, and settled down to raise her kids in the 'burbs, she had difficulty finding her favorite Asian ingredients at the local supermarket. So, Marnie tweaked her recipes to work with readily available ingredients, allowing her and her family to enjoy Asian food everyday. In Everyday Asian, Marnie shares seventy-five of her favorite dishes with home cooks.<br/>As the recipes draw on the traditional cuisines of Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and India, Marnie begins the book with a chapter detailing how to find, make, and store necessary ingredients, as well as giving advice on invaluable kitchen equipment for Asian cooking.<br/>Here's your opportunity to master classicdishes such as Pad Thai, Chinese Pork Roasts, Spring Rolls, and Vietnamese Pho, and expand your imagination with Marnie's innovative recipes for Asian Pesto (replace pine nuts with peanuts and Italian basil with Thai basil, cilantro, and mint) and Spicy Chicken Wings (an American classic with a good dose of Asian spices).<br/>It's clear from the abundance of Japanese, Korean, Indian, and Vietnamese restaurants that Americans are crazy about Asian food; however, cooking the real thing at home has always been a problem if you don't live near an Asian market. Now, with Marnie's easy-to-follow recipes, enjoying Asian food as often as you like is just a supermarket aisle away.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/60/9780060084660.jpg', 'title_long': 'Everyday Asian: From Soups to Noodles, From Barbecues to Curries, Your Favorite Asian Recipes Made Easy', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2003-07-29', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Regional & International', 'Asian'], 'authors': ['Marnie Henricksson'], 'title': 'Everyday Asian: From Soups to Noodles, From Barbecues to Curries, Your Favorite Asian Recipes Made Easy', 'isbn13': '9780060084660', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0062032704'}, 'isbn': '0060084669', 'isbn10': '0060084669', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062032706', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
