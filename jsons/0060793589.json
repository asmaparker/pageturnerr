{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Ophelia has always considered her psychic abilities an imposition, except for those times she's been able to put her paranormal talents to good use—like when a friend asks her to help find a missing teenager. Unfortunately it means she and Abby, her kindly, canny sorceress granny, will be taking to the road to pursue the vanished girl in the wilds of Minnesota.<br/>The signs are pointing toward the secluded new age research facility of Jason and Juliet Finch, who live with their troubled—and possibly matricidal—thirteen-year-old niece. And a bizarre local murder that follows their arrival—plus the appearance of a mysterious Native American shaman—only emphasize the urgency of Ophelia and Abby's hunt, drawing them into a web of dark secrets and to the last place they'd ever wish to be: a cottage in the woods where true evil quite possibly resides.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/86/9780060793586.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Trouble with Witches (Ophelia & Abby Mysteries, No. 3)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.36 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.36}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006-08-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Shirley Damsgaard'], 'title': 'The Trouble with Witches (Ophelia & Abby Mysteries, No. 3)', 'isbn13': '9780060793586', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061754803'}, 'isbn': '0060793589', 'isbn10': '0060793589', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061754807', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
