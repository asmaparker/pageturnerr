{"book": {"publisher": "Mariner Books", "synopsis": ""Remarkable and utterly fascinating" (Jane Goodall), author Dale Peterson and Harvard University biological anthropology professor Richard Wrangham\"s Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence is a groundbreaking study on human violence.<br/><br/>Whatever their virtues, men are more violent than women. Why do men kill, rape, and wage war, and what can we do about it?<br/><br/>Based on human evolution studies and about our closest living relatives, the great apes, Demonic Males presents a compelling argument that the secrets of a peaceful society may well be, first, a sharing of power between males and females, and second, a high level and variety of sexual activity, both homosexual and heterosexual.<br/><br/>Dramatic, vivid, and sometimes shocking, but firmly grounded in meticulous scientific research, Demonic Males will stir controversy and debate. It will be required reading for anyone concerned about the spiral of violence undermining human society.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/32/9780395877432.jpg", "title_long": "Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence", "edition": "10/15/97", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.10231131 pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.81}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.10231131}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 350, "date_published": "1997-11-14", "subjects": ["Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Evolutionary Psychology', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Zoology', 'Evolution', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'General', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Violence in Society', 'Anthropology'], 'authors": ["Dale Peterson', 'Richard Wrangham'], 'title": "Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence", "isbn13": "9780395877432", "msrp": 9.72, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0395877431", "isbn10": "0395877431"}}
