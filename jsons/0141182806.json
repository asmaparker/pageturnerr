{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classic", "synopsis": ""Everybody knows now that Ulysses is the greatest novel of the century" Anthony Burgess, Observer Following the events of one single day in Dublin, the 16th June 1904, and what happens to the characters Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom and his wife Molly, Ulysses is a monument to the human condition. It has survived censorship, controversy and legal action, and even been deemed blasphemous, but remains an undisputed modernist classic: ceaselessly inventive, garrulous, funny, sorrowful, vulgar, lyrical and ultimately redemptive. It confirms Joyce"s belief that literature 'is the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man'.
