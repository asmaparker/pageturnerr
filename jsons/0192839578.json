{"book": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "synopsis": "The Charterhouse of Parma (1839) is a compelling novel of passion and daring. Set at the beginning of the 19th-century in northern Italy, it traces the joyous but ill-starred amorous exploits of a handsome young aristocrat called Fabrice del Dongo. The novel"s great achievement is to conjure up the excitement and romance of youth while never losing sight of the harsh realities which beset the pursuit of happiness. This new translation captures Stendhal"s narrative verse, while the Introduction explores the novel"s reception and the reasons for its enduring popularity and power.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/72/9780192839572.jpg", "title_long": "The Charterhouse of Parma (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 560, "date_published": "1999-12-09", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Stendhal'], 'title": "The Charterhouse of Parma (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'isbn13": "9780192839572", "msrp": 11.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0192839578", "isbn10": "0192839578"}}
