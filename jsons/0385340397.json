{"book": {"publisher": "Dell", "synopsis": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The sixth book in Diana Gabaldon’s acclaimed Outlander saga, the basis for the Starz original series.<br/><br/>“The large scope of the novel allows Gabaldon to do what she does best, paint in exquisite detail the lives of her characters.”—Booklist<br/><br/>The year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest.<br/><br/>With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence—with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which reports Jamie’s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/97/9780385340397.jpg", "title_long": "A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 9.1 Inches, Length: 6.1 Inches, Weight: 2.0625 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.0625}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.1}}, "pages": 1008, "date_published": "2006-08-29", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Time Travel', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Romantic'], 'authors": ["Diana Gabaldon'], 'title": "A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander)", "isbn13": "9780385340397", "msrp": 20, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0385340397", "isbn10": "0385340397"}}
