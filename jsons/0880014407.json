{"book": {"publisher": "HarperCollins", "synopsis": "A woman\"s lover seems not to recognize her on the street. A teenage girl accepts a ride from a stranger in a rust-speckled Cadillac. An old man is obsessed by the memory of his innocent childhood intrusion on a half-dressed aunt.<br/>In forty-four very short, very powerful stories, Joyce Carol Oates fashions brief, intensely compact dramas out of the unwieldy material of human experience. The stories in The Assignation are infused with a "radiant intensity," wrote James Atlas in the New York Times Book Review, and they convey the depth and scope of a novel in a few charged pages. The Assignation is an electric display of the talents that make Joyce Carol Oates one of our finest short story writers.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/03/9780880014403.jpg", "title_long": "The Assignation", "edition": "1st Ecco Pbk.
