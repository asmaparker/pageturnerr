{'book': {'publisher': 'Unwin Hyman', 'synopsis': "The major contributors to the sociology of knowledge have agreed that the conclusions of science depend on social action only in a very limited sense. This view is examined critically and it is argued that scientific knowledge should be included fully within the scope of sociological analysis. The production of scientific knowledge is depicted as a process of negotiation, the outcome of which depends on participants' use of resources which are both technical and social. It is shown how cultural resources are taking over from the broader cultural milieu and incorporated into the body of certified knowledge; and how, in the wider political context, scientists' claims are conditioned and affected by their social allegiances.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/45/9780043010945.jpg', 'title_long': 'Science and the Sociology of Knowledge', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.4299014109 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4299014109}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '1979', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors': ['Michael J.
