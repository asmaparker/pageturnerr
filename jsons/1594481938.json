{"book": {"publisher": "Riverhead Books", "synopsis": "“One New Year’s Eve, four people with very different reasons but a common purpose find their way to the top of a fifteen-story building in London. None of them has calculated that, on a date humans favor for acts of significance, in a place known as a local suicide-jumpers’ favorite, they might encounter company. A Long Way Down is the story of what happens next, and of what doesn’t.” —The New York Times Book Review<br/><br/>A wise, affecting novel from the beloved, award-winning author of Dickens and Prince, Funny Girl and High Fidelity<br/><br/>Nick Hornby mines the hearts and psyches of four lost souls who connect just when they’ve reached the end of the line.<br/><br/>In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/32/9781594481932.jpg", "title_long": "A Long Way Down", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.18 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.95 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.18}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.95}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.6}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.96}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2006-05-02", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Nick Hornby'], 'title": "A Long Way Down", "isbn13": "9781594481932", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101146796"}, "isbn": "1594481938", "isbn10": "1594481938", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101146798", "binding": "print"}]}}
