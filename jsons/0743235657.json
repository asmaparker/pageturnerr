{"book": {"publisher": "Touchstone", "synopsis": "Updated to include Paul McCartney’s knighting and the deaths of John Lennon and George Harrison.<br/><br/>Philip Norman’s biography of the Beatles is the definitive work on the world"s most influential band—a beautifully written account of their lives, their music, and their times. Now brought completely up to date, this epic tale charts the rise of four scruffy Liverpool lads from their wild, often comical early days to the astonishing heights of Beatlemania, from the chaos of Apple and the collapse of hippy idealism to the band"s acrimonious split. It also describes their struggle to escape the smothering Beatles’ legacy and the tragic deaths of John Lennon and George Harrison. Witty, insightful, and moving, Shout! is essential reading not just for Beatles fans but for anyone with an interest in pop music.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/55/9780743235655.jpg", "title_long": "Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation", "edition": "Updated,Subsequent", "dimensions": "Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.52 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.52}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.2}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4375}}, "pages": 608, "date_published": "2005-02-15", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Musical Genres', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Composers & Musicians', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Pop Culture', 'Beatles', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Philip Norman'], 'title": "Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation", "isbn13": "9780743235655", "msrp": 20, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0743253787"}, "isbn": "0743235657", "isbn10": "0743235657", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780743253789", "binding": "print"}]}}
