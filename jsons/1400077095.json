{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "ISABEL DALHOUSIE - Book 1<br/><br/>Nothing captures the charm of Edinburgh like the bestselling Isabel Dalhousie series of novels featuring the insatiably curious philosopher and woman detective. Whether investigating a case or a problem of philosophy, the indefatigable Isabel Dalhousie, one of fiction’s most richly developed amateur detectives, is always ready to pursue the answers to all of life’s questions, large and small.<br/><br/>In this first installment, Isabel is attending a concert in the Usher Hall when she witnesses a man fall from the upper balcony. Isabel can’t help wondering whether it was the result of mischance or mischief. Against the best advice of her no-nonsense housekeeper Grace, her bassoon playing friend Jamie, and even her romantically challenged niece Cat, she is morally bound to solve this case. Complete with wonderful Edinburgh atmosphere and characters straight out of a Robert Burns poem, The Sunday Philosophy Club is a delightful treat from one of our most beloved authors.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/90/9781400077090.jpg", "title_long": "The Sunday Philosophy Club (Isabel Dalhousie Series)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.05 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.05}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2005-07-12", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Women's Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Women Sleuths', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Alexander McCall Smith'], 'title": "The Sunday Philosophy Club (Isabel Dalhousie Series)", "isbn13": "9781400077090", "msrp": 15, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1400077095", "isbn10": "1400077095"}}
