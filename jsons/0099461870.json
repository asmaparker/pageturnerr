{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage Books USA", "synopsis": "Fuelled by innumerable cigarettes, Martin Amis provides dazzling portraits of contemporaries and mentors alike: Larkin and Rushdie; Greene and Pritchett; Ballard and Burgess and Nicholson Baker; John Updike - warts and all. Vigorously zipping across to Washington, he exposes the double-think of nuke-speak; in New Orleans the Republican Convention gets a going over. And then there"s sport: he visits the world of darts and its disastrous attempt to clean itself up; dirty tricks in the world of chess; and some brisk but vicious poker with Al Alvarez and David Mamet. Sex without Madonna, expulsion from school, a Stones gig that should have been gagged, on set with Robocop or on court with Gabriela Sabatini, this is Martin Amis at his electric best.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/18/76/9780099461876.jpg", "title_long": "Visiting Mrs Nabokov : And Other Excursions", "edition": "New Ed", "dimensions": "Height: 7.71652 Inches, Length: 5.03936 Inches, Weight: 0.44 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.03936}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7874}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.71652}}, "pages": 274, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'History & Criticism', 'Books & Reading'], 'authors": ["Martin Amis'], 'title": "Visiting Mrs Nabokov : And Other Excursions", "isbn13": "9780099461876", "msrp": 19.75, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0099461870", "isbn10": "0099461870"}}
