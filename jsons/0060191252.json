{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': "Parenthood by Proxy is a passionate and provocative summation of the perils of parenting and a road map to safety for America's families.<br/>Never one to shy away from tough truths, Dr. Laura marshals compelling evidence for the widespread neglect of America's children and condemns the numerous rationalizations to excuse it. Parents, special interest groups, and professionals in education and psychology all contribute to a dangerous trend that places adult fulfillment above obligation to children. Parenthood by Proxy addresses the causes and effects of this national crisis, among them the high rate of divorce, serial marriages, single parenting, the premature sexualization of children, dual-career families, disdain for religion, the redefinition of immoral behavior as lifestyle choices, and societal intolerance for the concept of judgment.<br/>In Parenthood by Proxy, Dr. Laura exhorts parents to make their own children their top priority and, if necessary, to change their lives to do so. In her straight-shooting style, Dr. Laura entreats parents to involve themselves in their children's hearts, minds, and souls, to cherish and protect them, and to commit to the essential task of teaching them right from wrong. She acknowledges that parents no longer get much support from neighbors or public and private institutions, but she urges mothers and fathers to work even harder to counteract the prevailing culture of selfishness and irresponsibility.<br/>Parenthood by Proxy covers all aspects of parenting, from childbearing to discipline, from multiple families to being role models.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/52/9780060191252.jpg', 'title_long': "Parenthood by Proxy: Don't Have Them If You Won't Raise Them", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2000-04-26', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Child Psychology', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Parent & Adult Child', 'Parenting', 'Parenting Boys', 'Parenting Girls', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Ethics & Morality'], 'authors': ['Dr. Laura Schlessinger'], 'title': "Parenthood by Proxy: Don't Have Them If You Won't Raise Them", 'isbn13': '9780060191252', 'msrp': 24, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060191252', 'isbn10': '0060191252'}}
