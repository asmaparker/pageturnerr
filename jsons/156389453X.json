{"book": {"publisher": "DC Comics", "synopsis": "A Vertigo cult classic returns with this new, third printing of KILL YOUR BOYFRIEND, written by Grant Morrison (FINAL CRISIS, THE INVISIBLES) and illustrated by Philip Bond (VIMANARAMA) and D\"Israeli (THE SANDMAN). Originally published in 1995, KILL YOUR BOYFRIEND is an over-the-top black comedy of rebellion and teen romance topped with a heady mix of random violence and dark humor.<br/><br/>A British schoolgirl yearning for excitement joins up with an angry rebel boy intent on tearing down middle-class England. Through their violent, anti-authority joyride – filled with sex, drugs, and anarchy – Morrison offers a scathing, often-hilarious take on the British suburban landscape, where edgy behavior provides an escape from sanity. This new printing also includes Morrison\"s 1998 afterword to the story and the origami "fortune teller,' with bizarre messages specially created by Morrison.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/34/9781563894534.jpg", "title_long": "Kill your boyfriend", "dimensions": "Height: 7.56 Inches, Length: 2.38 Inches, Weight: 0.000625 Pounds, Width: 4.72 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.38}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.72}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.000625}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.56}}, "pages": 55, "date_published": "1998", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Publishers', 'DC', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure'], 'authors": ['Grant Morrison'], 'title": "Kill your boyfriend", "isbn13": "9781563894534", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "156389453X", "isbn10": "156389453X"}}
