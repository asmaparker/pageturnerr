The mystical and transcendent experience that followed set him off on an exploration that was to produce a revolutionary body of work about the inner reaches of the human mind. Huxley was decades ahead of his time in his anticipation of the dangers modern culture was creating through explosive population increase, headlong technological advance, and militant nationalism, and he saw psychedelics as the greatest means at our disposal to "remind adults that the real world is very different from the misshapen universe they have created for themselves by means of their culture-conditioned prejudices." Much of Huxley\"s writings following his 1953 mescaline experiment can be seen as his attempt to reveal the power of these substances to awaken a sense of the sacred in people living in a technological society hostile to mystical revelations.<br/><br/>Moksha, a Sanskrit word meaning 'liberation,' is a collection of the prophetic and visionary writings of Aldous Huxley. It includes selections from his acclaimed novels Brave New World and Island, both of which envision societies centered around the use of psychedelics as stabilizing forces, as well as pieces from The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell, his famous works on consciousness expansion.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/80/9780892817580.jpg", "title_long": "Moksha: Aldous Huxley"s Classic Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience", 'dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.38 Inches, Weight: 0.59083886216 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.38}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.59083886216}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "1999-04-01", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'British & Irish', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Divination', 'Other Religions, Practices & Sacred Texts', 'Mysticism', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Cognitive'], 'authors": ["Aldous Huxley'], 'title": "Moksha: Aldous Huxley"s Classic Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience", 'isbn13": "9780892817580", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1594775176", "ePub": "1594775176"}, "isbn": "0892817585", "isbn10": "0892817585", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781594775178", "binding": "print"}]}}
