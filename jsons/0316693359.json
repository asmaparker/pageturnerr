{"book": {"publisher": "Back Bay Books", "synopsis": "Travis McKinley is an ordinary man living an ordinary life - he has a job that he despises, a marriage that has lost its passion, children from whom he feels disconnected, and at age fifty, a sense that he has accomplished nothing of consequence with his life. But on Christmas Day, he goes out to play a round of golf, and for the first time, he finds himself in the "zone". He sees the putting line that has eluded him for years. Always a fairly good golfer, he finds himself playing like a pro and is so caught up in his excitement that he continues to play, sinking putt after putt, missing Christmas dinner with his wife and family. It is too much for his already troubled marriage.<br/><br/>His family collapes - but Travis is soon too busy living his dream to notice. His amazing new golf skills catapult him into the PGA Senior Open at Pebble Beach, where he advances to the final round with two of his heroes, Jack Nicklaus and Raymond Floyd. And with his wife, children,and a live television audience watching, a miracle takes place on the 17th green that will change Travis, and his family, forever.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/56/9780316693356.jpg", "title_long": "Miracle on the 17th Green: A Novel about Life, Love, Family, Miracles ... and Golf", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 160, "date_published": "1999-05-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors": ["James Patterson'], 'title": "Miracle on the 17th Green: A Novel about Life, Love, Family, Miracles ... and Golf", "isbn13": "9780316693356", "msrp": 12.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0316693359", "isbn10": "0316693359"}}
