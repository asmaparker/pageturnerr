{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperColl', 'synopsis': "Lorelei Connelly is no ordinary eleven-year-old. She's practical and a forward thinker. When her favorite cat, Mud, dies, she starts a journal to him, chronicling her daily life as a sixth grader so that he can continue to follow her rise to fame and fortune as a beloved actress, celebrated chef, and/or bestselling author. She figures it's also a good way to make sure her future biographers don't get anything wrong about her. But when her parents' marriage starts to unravel, Lorelei's lighthearted daily log becomes a poignant and defiantly humorous account of a family in distress as Lorelei grapples with the ground shifting under her feet.<br/>Yeardley Smith engages the reader with wit, candor, and authenticity.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/47/9780061493447.jpg', 'title_long': 'I, Lorelei', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 339, 'date_published': '2009-01-27', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Arts, Music & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life'], 'authors': ['Yeardley Smith'], 'title': 'I, Lorelei', 'isbn13': '9780061493447', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061493449', 'isbn10': '0061493449'}}
