In the midst of fear and chaos, survivors banded together to fight for what remained of their homes. Then word reached the people that the terrible war was over.<br/>Now penniless but still hopeful, Willow vows she will take care of her friends, and her ailing uncle, in Thunder Ridge, Texas, even if it means having to marry wealthy Silas Sterling, a man thirty years her senior. But standing in her way is sawmill owner Tucker Gray, with his enticing eyes and infuriating headstrong mannerâ€”the man Willow cannot get out of her head . . . or her heart. Even though her friends beg her not to give up her dream of happiness, Willow is determined to do the right thing for those who are dearest to her. But which path does God want Willow to take: a life of duty and commitment . . . or a life of everlasting love?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/14/9780061364914.jpg', 'title_long': 'Twice Loved (Belles of Timber Creek, Book 1)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.49383546688 Pounds, Width: 0.65 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49383546688}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2008-07-22', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Westerns', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Lori Copeland'], 'title': 'Twice Loved (Belles of Timber Creek, Book 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061364914', 'msrp': 10.7, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061983225'}, 'isbn': '0061364916', 'isbn10': '0061364916', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061983221', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
