When he bogies the last four holes and blows his lead in a major tournament -- again -- he berates his caddy, Henry "Greyhound" Mote. Jobe loses both Greyhound, who walks off the course, and the game. And before the day is out, he\"ll lose his eyesight to a lightning strike and his future in golf -- unless he can do what no one has ever done blind: make a comeback. Bob Cullen\'s funny and wise story, full of PGA lore, perfectly captures the mysterious and irresistible nature of the game of golf, not to mention, love, friendship, and life.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/35/24/9780060933524.jpg", "title_long": "A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 0.95 Inches, Length: 8.08 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 5.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.08}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.66}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.95}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "2002-05-07", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Sports', 'Friendship', 'United States', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Golf'], 'authors": ["Robert Cullen'], 'title": "A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780060933524", "msrp": 13.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060933526", "isbn10": "0060933526"}}
