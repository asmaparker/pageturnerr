{"book": {"publisher": "Everyman"s Library", "synopsis": "The brevity of Muriel Spark’s novels is equaled only by their brilliance. These four novels, each a miniature masterpiece, illustrate her development over four decades. Despite the seriousness of their themes, all four are fantastic comedies of manners, bristling with wit.<br/><br/>Spark’s most celebrated novel, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, tells the story of a charismatic schoolteacher’s catastrophic effect on her pupils. The Girls of Slender Means is a beautifully drawn portrait of young women living in a hostel in London in the giddy postwar days of 1945. The Driver’s Seat follows the final haunted hours of a woman descending into madness. And The Only Problem is a witty fable about suffering that brings the Book of Job to bear on contemporary terrorism.<br/><br/>All four novels give evidence of one of the most original and unmistakable voices in contemporary fiction. Characters are vividly etched in a few words; earth-shaking events are lightly touched on. Yet underneath the glittering surface there is an obsessive probing of metaphysical questions: the meaning of good and evil, the need for salvation, the search for significance.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/67/9781400042067.jpg", "title_long": "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, The Girls of Slender Means, The Driver"s Seat, The Only Problem: Introduction by Frank Kermode (Everyman"s Library Contemporary Classics Series)', 'edition": "1st THUS", "dimensions": "Height: 8.31 Inches, Length: 5.27 Inches, Weight: 1.23 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.27}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.13}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.23}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.31}}, "pages": 504, "date_published": "2004-04-06", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Women's Fiction', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Muriel Spark'], 'title": "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, The Girls of Slender Means, The Driver"s Seat, The Only Problem: Introduction by Frank Kermode (Everyman"s Library Contemporary Classics Series)', 'isbn13": "9781400042067", "msrp": 16.44, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1400042062", "isbn10": "1400042062"}}
