{"book": {"publisher": "Eraserhead Press", "synopsis": "Absurd philosophies, dark surrealism, and the end of the human race . . . God hates you. All of you. He closed the gates of Heaven and wants you to rot on Earth forever. Not only that, he is repossesing your souls and feeding them to a large vagina-like machine called the Walm - an interdimensional doorway that brings His New Children into the world. He loves these new children, but He doesn\"t love you. They are more interesting than you. They are beautiful, psychotic, magical, sex-crazed, and deadly. They are turning your cities into apocalyptic chaos, and there\"s nothing you can do about it ... Featuring: a narrator who sees his body from a third-person perspective, a man whose flesh is dead but his body parts are alive and running amok, an overweight messiah, the personal life of the Grim Reaper, lots of classy sex and violence, and a motley group of squatter punks that team up with the devil to find their place in a world that doesn\"t want them anymore.<br/><br/>'This generation\'s Vonnegut!' - Vincent Sakowski', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/35/9780971357235.jpg", "title_long": "Satan Burger", "edition": 1, "dimensions": "height: 216 mm, length: 140 mm, width: 14 mm, weight: 305 g", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "mm", "value": 140}, "width": {"unit": "mm", "value": 14}, "weight": {"unit": "g", "value": 305}, "height": {"unit": "mm", "value": 216}}, "pages": 236, "date_published": "2001-11-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Genre Fiction', 'Absurdist', 'Horror'], 'authors": ["Carlton Mellick III'], 'title": "Satan Burger", "isbn13": "9780971357235", "msrp": 13.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0971357234", "isbn10": "0971357234"}}
