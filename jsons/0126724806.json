{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Sensory Evaluation Practices examines the principles and practices of sensory evaluation. It describes methods and procedures for the analysis of results from sensory tests; explains the reasons for selecting a particular procedure or test method; and discusses the organization and operation of a testing program, the design of a test facility, and the interpretation of results. Comprised of three parts encompassing nine chapters, this volume begins with an overview of sensory evaluation: what it does; how, where, and for whom; and its origin in physiology and psychology. It then discusses measurement, psychological errors in testing, statistics, test strategy, and experimental design. The reader is also introduced to the discrimination, descriptive, and affective methods of testing, along with the criteria used to select a specific method, procedures for data analysis, and the communication of actionable results. The book concludes by looking at problems where sensory evaluation is applicable, including correlation of instrumental and sensory data, measurement of perceived efficacy, storage testing, and product optimization. This book is a valuable resource for sensory professionals, product development and production specialists, research directors, technical managers, and professionals involved in marketing, marketing research, and advertising.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/06/9780126724806.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sensory Evaluation Practices', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.4991433816 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4991433816}}, 'pages': 326, 'date_published': '1985-05-12', 'subjects': ['Food Science', 'Botany', 'Professional, Career & Trade -> Food Technology -> Food Science', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Botany'], 'authors': ['Herbert Stone', 'Joel L.
