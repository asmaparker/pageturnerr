{"book": {"publisher": "John Wiley &Sons", "synopsis": "Today’s young women are smart, educated, career-oriented, and maybe a little bit fashion-obsessed. So where does the spiritual life fit in? With InStyle magazine on one nightstand, and Julian of Norwich on the other, author Donna Freitas has her finger on the pulse of a new generation of women and understands the spiritual issues that most concern them. Drawing on the stories of popular heroines such as Bridget Jones and Carrie Bradshaw, Becoming a Goddess of Inner Poise illustrates how our life choices can have a profoundly spiritual dimension—in the bedroom, the boardroom, the beach, and at Barney’s. Freitas combines wisdom from a variety of spiritual traditions and with a generous dash of humor, giving modern women a new model for the spiritual journey.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/86/9780787976286.jpg", "title_long": "Becoming a Goddess of Inner Poise", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.70768386102 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.62}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.70768386102}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2004-11-02", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture'], 'authors": ["Freitas Freitas'], 'title": "Becoming a Goddess of Inner Poise", "isbn13": "9780787976286", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0787976288", "isbn10": "0787976288"}}
