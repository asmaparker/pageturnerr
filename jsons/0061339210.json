Not so for Rose, a beautiful, mysterious woman who comes to the home pregnant but not unwed. She plans to give up her baby because she knows she cannot be the mother it needs. But St. Elizabeth's is near a healing spring, and when Rose's time draws near, she cannot go through with her plans, not all of them. And she cannot remain forever untouched by what she has left behind . . . and who she has become in the leaving.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/19/9780061339219.jpg', 'title_long': 'Patron Saint of Liars, The', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2007-09-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Ann Patchett'], 'title': 'Patron Saint of Liars, The', 'isbn13': '9780061339219', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0061339210', 'isbn10': '0061339210'}}
