This striking assertion is at the heart of Rebecca Solnit’s new book, which weaves together biography, history, and fascinating insights into art and technology to create a boldly original portrait of America on the threshold of modernity. The story of Muybridge—who in 1872 succeeded in capturing high-speed motion photographically—becomes a lens for a larger story about the acceleration and industrialization of everyday life. Solnit shows how the peculiar freedoms and opportunities of post–Civil War California led directly to the two industries—Hollywood and Silicon Valley—that have most powerfully defined contemporary society.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/41/04/9780142004104.jpg", "title_long": "River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.42 Inches, Length: 5.46 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.46}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.42}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2004-03-02", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Artists, Architects & Photographers', 'Movie Directors', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Direction & Production', 'Video', 'History', 'Americas', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Rebecca Solnit'], 'title": "River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West", "isbn13": "9780142004104", "msrp": 12, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101662662", "ePub": "1101662662"}, "isbn": "0142004103", "isbn10": "0142004103", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101662663", "binding": "print"}]}}
