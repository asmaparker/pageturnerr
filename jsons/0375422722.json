{"book": {"publisher": "Pantheon Books", "synopsis": "THE NO. 1 LADIES’ DETECTIVE AGENCY - Book 7<br/><br/>Fans around the world adore the best-selling No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency series and its proprietor, Precious Ramotswe, Botswana’s premier lady detective. In this charming series, Mma Ramotswe—with help from her loyal associate, Grace Makutsi—navigates her cases and her personal life with wisdom, good humor, and the occasional cup of tea.<br/><br/>A cobra has been found in Precious Ramotswe’s office. Then a nurse from a local medical clinic reveals that faulty blood–pressure readings are being recorded there. And Botswana has a new advice columnist, Aunty Emang, whose advice is rather curt for Mma Ramotswe’s taste.<br/><br/>All this means a lot of work for our heroine and her inestimable assistant, Grace Makutsi, and they are, of course, up to the challenge. But there’ s trouble brewing in Mma Makutsi’s own life. When Phuti Radiphuti misses their customary dinner date, she begins to wonder if he is having second thoughts about their engagement. And while Mma Makutsi may be able to buy that fashionably narrow (and uncomfortable) pair of blue shoes, it may not buy her the happiness that Mma Ramotswe promises her she’ll find in the simpler things—in contentment with the world and enough tea to smooth over the occasional bumps in the road.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/20/9780375422720.jpg", "title_long": "Blue Shoes and Happiness", "edition": "1st Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.54 Inches, Length: 5.79 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.79}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.97}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.54}}, "pages": 227, "date_published": "2006-04-18", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Women's Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Alexander McCall Smith'], 'title": "Blue Shoes and Happiness", "isbn13": "9780375422720", "msrp": 21.95, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"ePub": "0375424261"}, "isbn": "0375422722", "isbn10": "0375422722", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780375424267", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
