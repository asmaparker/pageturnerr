But all that changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami death god. Any human whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer. With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble goal...or his life?<br/><br/>After a week locked up with no one but Ryuk for company, Light is ready to give up his Death Note and all memories of it. Freed from his past actions, Light is convinced he"s innocent. But L is ready to keep Light under lock and key forever, especially since the killings stopped once Light was incarcerated. Then a new wave of Kira crimes hits Japan. Someone else has gotten their hands on a Death Note, and these new deaths aren"t focused on making the world a better place, they're focused on making money. Big business can be murder, and Kira has gone corporate!', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/65/9781421506265.jpg", "title_long": "Death Note, Vol. 5", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 inches, Length: 5 inches, Weight: 0.4078551847 Pounds, Width: 0.7 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4078551847}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2006-05-02", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery, Thriller & Crime', 'Media Tie-In', 'Shonen', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ["Tsugumi Ohba'], 'title": "Death Note, Vol. 5", "isbn13": "9781421506265", "msrp": 6.75, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1421506262", "isbn10": "1421506262"}}
