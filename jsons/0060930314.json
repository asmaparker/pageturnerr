{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial", "synopsis": ""Kundera, master of the twosome, finds erotic and existential threads everywhere in daily behavior. Like his previous books, Identity is a cluster of jeweled observations. . . . But Identity has a special charm: suspense. . . . [It] gets us turning the pages in excitement and alarm, and Kundera\"s wit keeps us turning them to the very end." — San Francisco Chronicle<br/>In a narrative as intense as it is brief, a moment of confusion sets in motion a complex chain of events which forces the reader to cross and recross the divide between fantasy and reality.<br/>Sometimes—perhaps only for an instant—we fail to recognize a companion; for a moment their identity ceases to exist, and thus we come to doubt our own. The effect is at its most acute in a couple, where our existence is given meaning by our perception of a lover, and theirs of us.<br/>With his astonishing skill at building on and out from the significant moment, Milan Kundera has placed such a situation and the resulting wave of panic at the core of this novel. Hailed as a 'a fervent and compelling romance, a moving fable about the anxieties of love and separateness' (Baltimore Sun), it is not to be missed.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/03/18/9780060930318.jpg", "title_long": "Identity: A Novel", "edition": "First Paperback Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "1999-04-21", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'Women's Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Milan Kundera'], 'title": "Identity: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780060930318", "msrp": 13.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060930314", "isbn10": "0060930314", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780063290709", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
