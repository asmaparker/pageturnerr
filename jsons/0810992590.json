{"book": {"publisher": "Harry N. Abrams, Inc.", "synopsis": "In Pink Box, photographer Joan Sinclair takes us on a journey inside the secret world of fuzoku (commercial sex) in Japan, a world where kawaii (cute) collides with consumerism and sex.<br/><br/>Unrivaled in their creativity and the sheer number of choices, the clubs featured in this book offer their clientele every fantasy imaginable. Subway groping, visits to the nurse\x92s office, and comic book character encounters are just the beginning of the immense list of possibilities that are played out in colorful playrooms for adults where no detail is overlooked. Sinclair\x92s photographs capture it all, while an introduction by sociologist James Farrer provides a brief history of commercial sex in Japan and places the images in the context of contemporary Japanese culture.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/97/9780810992597.jpg", "title_long": "Pink Box: Inside Japan"s Sex Clubs", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "height: 235 mm, length: 203 mm, width: 13 mm, weight: 862 g", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "mm", "value": 203}, "width": {"unit": "mm", "value": 13}, "weight": {"unit": "g", "value": 862}, "height": {"unit": "mm", "value": 235}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2006-10-01", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Photography & Video', 'Erotic Photography', 'Travel'], 'authors": ["Joan Sinclair'], 'title": "Pink Box: Inside Japan"s Sex Clubs", 'isbn13": "9780810992597", "msrp": 29.47, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0810992590", "isbn10": "0810992590"}}
