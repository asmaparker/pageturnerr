{'book': {'publisher': 'Pearson P T R', 'synopsis': 'The #1 Principle of Sustainable Business Success Is Simpler Than You Think<br/><br/>\x93Do the Right Thing is about how any company can stay true to its soul. Jim Parker\x92s deep and abiding belief in the power of people and culture in building a business of lasting worth is evident everywhere; so too is his humility and selflessness as a leader--his stories are not about his own achievements, which are many, but those of the people he led, one of the great success stories of our time.\x94<br/>--Sean Moriarty, CEO, Ticketmaster<br/><br/>\x93Do the Right Thing offers insightful views into the culture, leadership, and decisions that build great companies the right way. A must read for my management team. THIS BOOK ROCKS.\x94<br/>--Kent Taylor, Founder and Chairman, Texas Roadhouse Restaurants<br/><br/>\x93The book is a fun read filled with memorable stories that get at the heart of what it takes to lead in a way that simultaneously satisfies employees, customers, and shareholders. Jim Parker plays the role of eloquent detective and ferrets out the interweaving parts that distributed leadership, culture, values, and teamwork play as the underlying layers of a company\x92s success. This is a book about heroes at all levels and the environment needed to create those heroes. A must-read for today\x92s leaders.\x94<br/>--Professor Deborah Ancona, Seley Distinguished Professor of Management and Faculty Director of the MIT Leadership Center,<br/>Sloan School of Management<br/><br/>\x93You\x92ll laugh and cry reading Jim\x92s book, and probably won\x92t be able to put it down. It will forever change the way you view the employees in your organization.\x94<br/>--Beverly K. Carmichael, Member, Board of Directors,<br/>Society for Human Resource Management<br/><br/>People matter most.<br/>You know that. But most companies would rather slash costs, cut headcount, replace well-paid employees with lower-paid employees or outsourced workers, and reduce customer service. No wonder so many fail\x96while others focused on doing the right thing remain profitable and growth oriented for decades. James F. Parker shows why \x93doing the right thing\x94 isn\x92t just naïve \x93feel-goodism:\x94 it\x92s the most powerful rule for business success. Parker\x92s stories won\x92t just convince you: They\x92ll move you. Naïve? No way. In this book, Southwest Airlines\x92 former CEO proves why doing what\x92s right is the #1 rule of business success. James F. Parker tells how after 9/11, Southwest made three pivotal decisions: no layoffs, no pay cuts, and no-hassle refunds for any customer wanting them. The result: Southwest remained profitable and its revenue passenger miles for 4Q01 held steady while the rest of its industry nearly collapsed...and Southwest\x92s market cap soon exceeded all its major competitors combined.
