{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster', 'synopsis': 'Product Description      A varied menu and list of animal guests for each day of the week demonstrate the kinds of food different animals eat and how their mouths are adapted to their individual eating habits.      From School Library Journal      Grade 2-6 Using the clever format of dinner menus, arranged by the days of the week, Blocksma has invited representative mammals, fish, reptiles, and birds to various feasts. As they settle in for their favorite foods, from nuts and seeds to grasses, shellfish, insects, and animal meats, a great deal of information about each animal, including its diet and adaptive mouth structure, is given. Blocksma keeps readers involved throughout by presenting well-organized information and including appealing, child-oriented comments. Huge amounts of information about a specialized subject is thus painlessly conveyed. The text is well organized, beginning with an introductory section presenting information about mouth structure. This is followed by seven "chapters," or feasts. In turn, each feast contains a menu, followed by descriptive passages referring to representative animals present. Numerous labeled black-and-white drawings supplement the engaging text.
