{"book": {"publisher": "Harpercollins Pub Ltd", "synopsis": "Joe and his parents are enjoying a summer holiday by the sea at the Ocean Star Hotel. The sky is bright blue, the sun shines and Joe loves all that the seaside has to offer. But when the fog rolls in and rain falls Joe begins to wish that he was back at home again. Things change, however, when the owner of the hotel invites Joe to share in a magical world, only a few steps away. The loft is black as night but then above Joe"s head a thousand tiny stars begin to sparkle and in the distance he hears the chug-chug-chug of a model train. A whole world is soon to open up before Joe"s eyes, a world of snow-capped mountains, great deserts, and rocking fishing boats.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/60/06/9780006646006.jpg", "title_long": "Ocean Star Express", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 10.5 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.440924524}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 32, "date_published": "2002", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Action & Adventure', 'Cars, Trains & Things That Go'], 'authors": ["Mark Haddon'], 'title": "Ocean Star Express", "isbn13": "9780006646006", "msrp": 11, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "000664600X", "isbn10": "000664600X"}}
