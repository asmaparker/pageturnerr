{"book": {"publisher": "Random House", "synopsis": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The classic chronicle of a “terribly misguided and terribly funny” (The Washington Post) hike of the Appalachian Trail, from the author of A Short History of Nearly Everything and The Body<br/><br/>“The best way of escaping into nature.”—The New York Times<br/><br/>Back in America after twenty years in Britain, Bill Bryson decided to reacquaint himself with his native country by walking the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine. The AT offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes—and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings.<br/><br/>For a start there’s the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa along for the walk. But A Walk in the Woods is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson’s acute eye is a wise witness to this beautiful but fragile trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America’s last great wilderness. An adventure, a comedy, and a celebration, A Walk in the Woods is a modern classic of travel literature.<br/><br/>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/26/9780767902526.jpg", "title_long": "Random House A Walk in The Woods", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.92 Inches, Length: 5.26 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.26}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.76}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.92}}, "pages": 276, "date_published": "1999", "subjects": ["Sports & Outdoors', 'Hiking & Camping', 'Excursion Guides', 'Categories'], 'authors": ["Bill Bryson'], 'title": "Random House A Walk in The Woods", "isbn13": "9780767902526", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Misc.", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307717836", "ePub": "0307717836"}, "isbn": "0767902521", "isbn10": "0767902521", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307717832", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
