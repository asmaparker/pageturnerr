{"book": {"publisher": "Transworld Publishers", "synopsis": "In August 1984, Michigan housewife Betty Mahmoody accompanied her husband to his native Iran for a two-week vacation that turned into a permanent stay. To her horror, she found herself and her four-year-old daughter, Mahtob, virtual prisoners of a man rededicated to his Shiite Moslem faith, in a land where women are near-slaves and Americans despised. Their only hope for escape lay in a dangerous underground that would not take her child.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/67/9780552152167.jpg", "title_long": "Not Without My Daughter", "edition": "New Ed", "dimensions": "Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.17322 Inches, Weight: 0.59083886216 Pounds, Width: 1.22047 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.17322}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.22047}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.59083886216}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.00786}}, "pages": 521, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Customs & Traditions', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ['Betty Mahmoody'], 'title": "Not Without My Daughter", "isbn13": "9780552152167", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0552152161", "isbn10": "0552152161"}}
