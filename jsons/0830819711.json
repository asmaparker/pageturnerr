There"s church and school and neighborhood and job and friends and recreation. And then the crises hit! Time for prayer seems an impossible luxury. As a pastor, Bill Hybels knows hundreds of people with schedules like this. Yet in his own life he has made the hard discovery that prayer doesn"t happen on the run. He decided he was too busy not to pray. Hybels"s accessible introduction to prayer has already helped over 400,000 readers develop a rich and regular prayer life in the midst of life's busyness. Now, in this revised and expanded 10th anniversary edition, he includes new insights from his years of ministry and his own spiritual journey. He shows how to slow down to pray, listen to God, respond to what we hear, practice the presence of God and overcome prayer barriers. His fun and practical book offers the resources we need for growing, ongoing experiences in prayer.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/13/9780830819713.jpg", "title_long": "Too Busy Not to Pray: 10th Anniversary Edition", "edition": "10th Anniversary", "dimensions": "Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.75}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "1998-04-17", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Worship & Devotion', 'Devotionals'], 'authors": ["Bill Hybels'], 'title": "Too Busy Not to Pray: 10th Anniversary Edition", "isbn13": "9780830819713", "msrp": 15, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0830819711", "isbn10": "0830819711"}}
