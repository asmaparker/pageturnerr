{"book": {"publisher": "Theatre Communications Group", "synopsis": "Jessica Hagedorn has transformed her bestselling novel about the Philippines during the reign of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos into an equally powerful theatrical piece that is a multi-layered tour de force. As Harold Bloom writes, "Hagedorn expresses the conflicts experienced by Asian immigrants caught between cultures . . . she takes aim at racism in the U.S. and develops in her dramas the themes of displacement and the search for belonging."<br/>Jessica Hagedorn is a performance artist, poet, novelist and playwright, born and raised in the Philippines. Her novels include Dogeaters (Penguin 1990) which was nominated for a National Book Award and The Gangster of Love (Penguin 1996); a short story collection, Danger and Beauty (City Lights 2002).", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/53/9781559362153.jpg", "title_long": "Dogeaters", "dimensions": "Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.4299014109 Pounds, Width: 0.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4299014109}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4}}, "pages": 96, "date_published": "2002-12-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Emigration & Immigration', 'Ethnic Studies'], 'authors": ["Jessica Hagedorn'], 'title": "Dogeaters", "isbn13": "9781559362153", "msrp": 12.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "155936825X", "ePub": "155936825X"}, "isbn": "1559362154", "isbn10": "1559362154", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781559368254", "binding": "ebook"}]}}
