{'book': {'publisher': 'International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press', 'synopsis': "Here's how to see the world from your boat. More and more people are taking off on their cruising boats for a few months or even a year. After they've tasted the cruising life, prepared and equipped their boats, and developed some experience, many cruisers begin to dream of voyaging farther--maybe even an around-the-world voyage.<br/>The Voyager's Handbook offers specific information for cruisers considering such a vast undertaking. An experienced circumnavigator, author Beth Leonard shows cruisers how to prepare their boat and themselves. She offers complete, up-to-date information on the latest gear and techniques and detaile, hard-earned advice from dozens of experienced sailors, about boats, crew, and costs as well as crucial but easily overlooked aspects of long-distance passagemaking such as health, safety, weather, provisions, fresh water, and foreign port protocol.<br/>With a balanced, down-to-earth approach, The Voyager's Handbook tells it like it is, for any cruiser considering that voyage of a lifetime.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/38/9780070381438.jpg', 'title_long': "The Voyager's Handbook: The Essential Guide to Blue Water Cruising", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.4 Inches, Length: 7.7 Inches, Weight: 2.29942139266 Pounds, Width: 1.18 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.18}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.29942139266}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.4}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '1998-01-01', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Water Sports', 'Boating', 'Sailing'], 'authors': ['Beth A.
