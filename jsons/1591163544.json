Thriving indistrial societies disappeared. The earth is slowly submerging beneath the expanding Sea of Corruption, an enormous toxic forest that creates mutant insects and releases a miasma of poisonous spores into the air.At the periphery of the sea, tiny kingdoms are scattered on tiny parcels of land. Here lies the Valley of the Wind, a kingdom of barely 500 citizens; a nation given fragile protection from the decaying sea"s poisons by the ocean breezes; and home to Nausicaä.<br/><br/>Nausicaä embarks on an inner, spiritual journey to the heart of the Sea of Corruption, where she discovers its surprising secret. She returns to the land of the living, compelled to share her discovery, but Nausicaä accidentally awakens a God Warrior from its stasis.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/41/9781591163541.jpg", "title_long": "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 6 (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind)", "edition": "2nd", "dimensions": "Height: 10.125 Inches, Length: 7.125 Inches, Weight: 0.5952481074 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5952481074}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.125}}, "pages": 168, "date_published": "2004-08-10", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Comic Strips', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Action & Adventure', 'Media Tie-In', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors": ["Hayao Miyazaki'], 'title": "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 6 (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind)", "isbn13": "9781591163541", "msrp": 8.96, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1591163544", "isbn10": "1591163544"}}
