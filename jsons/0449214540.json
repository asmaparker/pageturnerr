Together they tried to forge a life . . .<br/><br/>“This big, ambitious novel comes as close to matters of faith and life as any book that has appeared. . . . Excellent.”—New York Post<br/><br/>First and foremost, Michael Kind was a man—a courageous man with strong ideals and feelings, a family man devoted to his two children, a passionate man deeply in love with his wife Leslie. He"d already become a rabbi when he met Leslie, a minister"s daughter. She fell in love with Michael and converted to Judaism to marry him.<br/><br/>This is their story, a sweeping drama of love and identity, of compassion and cruelty, a searing tale of one man and one woman who must learn to cope with the complications of an unorthodox life in a world that will not accept them, in a world where rabbis and non-Jews do not fall in love—let alone marry . . .<br/><br/>“A human and enlightening portrait of a rabbi as a man, called upon constantly to be something more than a man: of a rabbi as a husband and father with the weakness and problems of other men . . .
