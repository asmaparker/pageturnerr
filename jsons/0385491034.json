{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "From the bestselling author of The Handmaid"s Tale and The Testaments—one of Margaret Atwood’s most unforgettable characters lurks at the center of this intricate novel like a spider in a web. The glamorous, irresistible, unscrupulous Zenia is nothing less than a fairy-tale villain in the memories of her former friends.<br/><br/>Roz, Charis, and Tony—university classmates decades ago—were reunited at Zenia’s funeral and have met monthly for lunch ever since, obsessively retracing the destructive swath she once cut through their lives. A brilliantly inventive fabulist, Zenia had a talent for exploiting her friends’ weaknesses, wielding intimacy as a weapon and cheating them of money, time, sympathy, and men.<br/><br/>But one day, five years after her funeral, they are shocked to catch sight of Zenia: even her death appears to have been yet another fiction. As the three women plot to confront their larger-than-life nemesis, Atwood proves herself a gleefully acute observer of the treacherous shoals of friendship, trust, desire, and power.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/37/9780385491037.jpg", "title_long": "The Robber Bride", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.19 Inches, Weight: 0.8125 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.12}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8125}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 528, "date_published": "1998-01-20", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Women's Fiction', 'Friendship', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Margaret Atwood'], 'title": "The Robber Bride", "isbn13": "9780385491037", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "030779797X"}, "isbn": "0385491034", "isbn10": "0385491034", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307797971", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
