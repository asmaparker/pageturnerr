Out of print for almost thirty years—due largely to initial audiences’ rejection of its strong black female protagonist—Hurston’s classic has since its 1978 reissue become perhaps the most widely read and highly acclaimed novel in the canon of African-American literature.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/34/9780060776534.jpg', 'title_long': 'Their Eyes Were Watching God CD', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.47 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.47}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}}, 'pages': 7, 'date_published': '2004-11-23', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Black & African American', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Zora Neale Hurston'], 'title': 'Their Eyes Were Watching God CD', 'isbn13': '9780060776534', 'msrp': 34.95, 'binding': 'Audio CD', 'isbn': '0060776536', 'isbn10': '0060776536'}}
