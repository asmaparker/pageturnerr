{"book": {"publisher": "Caedmon", "synopsis": "“A deeply soulful novel that comprehends love and cruelty, and separates the big people from the small of heart, without ever losing sympathy for those unfortunates who don’t know how to live properly.” —Zadie Smith<br/>One of the most important and enduring books of the twentieth century, Their Eyes Were Watching God brings to life a Southern love story with the wit and pathos found only in the writing of Zora Neale Hurston. Out of print for almost thirty years—due largely to initial audiences’ rejection of its strong black female protagonist—Hurston’s classic has since its 1978 reissue become perhaps the most widely read and highly acclaimed novel in the canon of African-American literature.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/65/34/9780060776534.jpg", "title_long": "Their Eyes Were Watching God CD", "edition": "Unabridged", "dimensions": "Height: 5.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.47 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.47}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.75}}, "pages": 7, "date_published": "2004-11-23", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Black & African American', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Zora Neale Hurston'], 'title": "Their Eyes Were Watching God CD", "isbn13": "9780060776534", "msrp": 34.95, 'binding": "Audio CD", "isbn": "0060776536", "isbn10": "0060776536"}}
