{"book": {"publisher": "Eminent Lives", "synopsis": ""A balanced, readable portrait. A refreshing perspective.” —New York Times Book Review<br/>With intelligence, insight, eloquence, and wit, bestselling author Christopher Hitchens gives us an artful portrait of a complex, formative figure in American history and his turbulent era.<br/>In this unique biography of Thomas Jefferson, leading journalist and social critic Christopher Hitchens offers a startlingly new and provocative interpretation of our Founding Father—a man conflicted by power who wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as ambassador to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. A masterly writer, Jefferson was an awkward public speaker. A professed proponent of emancipation, he elided the issue of slavery from the Declaration of Independence and continued to own human property. A reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/69/9780060598969.jpg", "title_long": "Thomas Jefferson: Author of America (Eminent Lives)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.12 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.83}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.12}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2005-05-31", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Presidents & Heads of State', 'History', 'Americas', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Christopher Hitchens'], 'title": "Thomas Jefferson: Author of America (Eminent Lives)", "isbn13": "9780060598969", "msrp": 21.99, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0060598964", "isbn10": "0060598964"}}
