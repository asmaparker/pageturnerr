{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'It\'s uncanny! Within six months of breaking up with her, Peg Silver\'s ex-lovers always meet and marry the women of their dreams. Even worse than being the eternal bridesmaid, she\'s the last girlfriend, the one who awakens in a guy theknowledge of what he\'s always wanted in a relationship . . . and it\'s never with Peg. Obviously, a major lifestyle change is seriously called for, which is why the distraught interior landscape designer says good-bye to Manhattan and late-night lattes with pal Nina, and hello to a farmhouse on ten acres in tiny, backwater Manshire, Vermont, hoping to meet the ultimate, all-organic country man (without too much facial hair) to keep her warm in those frosty New England winters.<br/>Instead, Peg finds herself at Inward Bound - a proactive adult-education retreat for the hapless and hopelessly lovelorn - to try to lift her dreaded "girlfriend curse." A steamy (and expressly forbidden) dalliance with gorgeous woman-eater Ray probably isn\'t going to help cure her. But some romantic insight could arise from her attraction to Linus, Inward Bound\'s sexy, scruffy, smart and still-single founder. Perhaps there is a secret to be unearthed in the crunchy Green Mountains, one that will magically transform Peg Silver from the Perpetual Also Ran to the Big Winner in love.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/49/9780060725549.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Girlfriend Curse', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.53 Pounds, Width: 0.720721 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.720721}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.53}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2005-03-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Single Women', 'Contemporary', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Valerie Frankel'], 'title': 'The Girlfriend Curse', 'isbn13': '9780060725549', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006184344X'}, 'isbn': '0060725540', 'isbn10': '0060725540', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061843440', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
