{'book': {'publisher': 'United Nations University Press', 'synopsis': 'This volume focuses on society at the local and regional levels in a scenario where human beings coexist harmoniously with nature. This ideal society is examined in terms of the relationships between villages or towns and their natural environment and how they can achieve independence while facing pressures toward centralization and globalization. Because this requires both food and energy independence, farms, villages, and towns must have access to natural renewable energy and material circulation systems. There also needs to be a system to facilitate collaboration among the various elements.<br/>To enable communities to retain their autonomy, public awareness of the importance of fostering local cultures and traditions is vital. Cultural independence demands that local ways of thinking be steered away from the "plunder nature" model toward "coexistence with nature." With economic globalization spearheading a trend toward standardization and uniformity in human values, this book highlights the importance of developing a society in harmony with nature through the networking of diverse communities to promote and achieve local independence.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/34/9789280811834.jpg', 'title_long': 'Designing Our Future: Local Perspectives on Bioproduction Ecosystems and Humanity (Sustainability Science Series)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.42 Inches, Length: 6.31 Inches, Weight: 1.67 Pounds, Width: 1.03 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.03}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.67}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.42}}, 'pages': 504, 'date_published': '2011-03-10', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Civil & Environmental', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Ecology', 'Earth Sciences', 'Environmental Science', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Urban Planning & Development', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Public Affairs & Policy', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Designing Our Future: Local Perspectives on Bioproduction Ecosystems and Humanity (Sustainability Science Series)', 'isbn13': '9789280811834', 'msrp': 39, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Page Fidelity': '9210563298', 'eBook': '9210563298'}, 'isbn': '9280811835', 'isbn10': '9280811835', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9789210563291', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
