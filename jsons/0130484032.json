The emphasis is on learning to solve problems. By concentrating on problem solving with several specific media, the authors show how a variety of technologies can be used to engage students in personally and socially constructed meaning. They address the Internet, and how it can be used to foster community building; video, and how naturally students take to being behind the camera; and multimedia, as a new form of interactive literacy. The Internet material also includes a section on creating a personal or group website, plus coverage of cybermentoring. For teachers in computer classes and media centers?of students at all grade levels.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/31/9780130484031.jpg', 'title_long': 'Learning to Solve Problems with Technology: A Constructivist Perspective (2nd Edition)', 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 0.91712300992 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91712300992}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2002-08-30', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Job Hunting & Careers', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Computers & Technology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['David H.
