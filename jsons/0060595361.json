{"book": {"publisher": "Avon", "synopsis": "The strongest, sexiest, and sassiest debut contemporary romance we"ve seen since Rachel Gibson! The quality of Dixie"s writing combined with the pure romance of the story guarantees that Avon Romance has just acquired a new star.<br/>Debbie Sue Overstreet is still the best-looking gal in Saltlick, TX-and her ex-husband Buddy is still the best-looking sheriff. Thanks to a thriving gossip mill (also known as Debbie"s hair salon), there isn't a thing in Saltlick that she doesn't know about before anyone else. That is, until somebody offs snooty Pearl Ann Carruthers. With Buddy on the case, the woman who has to know everything is stumped by not just one, but two questions: first, who killed Pearl Ann and why, and second, how on earth did she ever let Buddy Overstreet get away? Lucky for Saltlick and Buddy both, she means to find out the answers, no matter what it takes!', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/53/64/9780060595364.jpg", "title_long": "Since You"re Leaving Anyway, Take Out the Trash (Domestic Equalizers)", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.02 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.1875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.96}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.02}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2004-08-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'Women's Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors": ["Dixie Cash'], 'title": "Since You"re Leaving Anyway, Take Out the Trash (Domestic Equalizers)", 'isbn13": "9780060595364", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "006175210X"}, "isbn": "0060595361", "isbn10": "0060595361", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061752100", "binding": "print"}]}}
