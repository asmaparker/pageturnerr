{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "America has no finer teller of tales than Ray Bradbury. For more than fifty years he has regaled us with wonders, enchanted us with memories, and startled us with simple truths, enabling us to view from fresh perspectives the world we inhabit, and see others we never dreamed existed.<br/>Now the master treats us to another round -- eighteen brand -- new stories and seven previously published but never before collected-proof positive that his magic is as potent as ever.

Taste the warm mysteries of summer and the bitterness of betrayed loves and abandoned places.

And every satisfying swallow brings new surprises and revelations.<br/>One More for the Road is superb refreshment served with wit, heart, and flair by the incomparable Bradbury. This one's on Ray.<br/>Drink up!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/60/9780066211060.jpg', 'title_long': 'One More for the Road: A New Story Collection', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 3 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2002-03-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Anthologies', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['Ray Bradbury'], 'title': 'One More for the Road: A New Story Collection', 'isbn13': '9780066211060', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0066211069', 'isbn10': '0066211069'}}
