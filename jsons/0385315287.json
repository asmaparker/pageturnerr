{"book": {"publisher": "Delta", "synopsis": "A half-mile up, suspended by nylon wings and the promise of good lift, life hanges on a pledge. Richard Bach made that pledge, fifty years before, to return to the frightened child he used to be and teach him everything he had learned from living. His promise went unfulfilled until one day, hovering between earth and sky, Richard encounters Dickie Bach, age nine--irrepressible challenger of every notion Richard embraces....<br/><br/>In this exhilarating adventure, Richard and Dickie probe the timeless questions both need answered if either is to be whole: Why does growing spiritually mean never growing up? Can we peacefully coexist with the consequences of our choices? Why is it that only by running from safety can we make our wildest dreams take flight?", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/89/9780385315289.jpg", "title_long": "Running from Safety: An Adventure of the Spirit", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.6}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "1995-11-01", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Chakras', 'Mental & Spiritual Healing', 'Spiritualism', 'Occult & Paranormal', 'Parapsychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Consciousness & Thought', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Richard Bach'], 'title": "Running from Safety: An Adventure of the Spirit", "isbn13": "9780385315289", "msrp": 17, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0385315287", "isbn10": "0385315287"}}
