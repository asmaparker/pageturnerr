{'book': {'publisher': 'Westland Books Pvt Ltd', 'synopsis': 'This once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils as its primary river, the revered Saraswathi, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devasting terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis. To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appear to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with astonishing martial skills. The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient legend: When evil reaches epic proportions, when all seems lost, when it appears that your enemies have triumphed, a hero will emerge. Is the rough-hewn Tibetan immigrant Shiva, really that hero? And does he want to be that hero at all? Drawn suddenly to his destiny, by duty as well as by love, will Shiva lead the Suryavanshi vengeance and destroy evil? This is the first book in a trilogy on Shiva, the simple man whose karma re-cast him as our Mahadev, the God of Gods.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/44/9789380658544.jpg', 'title_long': 'Immortals of Meluha', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.5748 Inches, Length: 7.874 Inches, Weight: 0.5291094288 pounds, Width: 5.5118 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.874}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5118}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5291094288}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5748}}, 'pages': 456, 'date_published': '2010-08-30', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['Amish Tripathi'], 'title': 'Immortals of Meluha', 'isbn13': '9789380658544', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9380658540', 'isbn10': '9380658540'}}
