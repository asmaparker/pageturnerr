{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Imogen, Lady Maitland, has decided to dance on the wild side. After all, she\'s in the delicious position of being able to take a lover. A discreet male who knows just when to leave in the morning.<br/>But Lady Maitland is still under the watchful eye of her former guardian, the wildly untamed Rafe, the Duke of Holbrook. He believes she is still in need of a "watchdog." She laughs at the idea that someone so insufferably lazy and devoted to drink can demand that she behave with propriety.<br/>It\'s Rafe\'s long-lost brother, a man who looks precisely like the duke but with none of his degenerate edge, who interests Imogen. To Imogen, he\'s the shadow duke . . . the man who really should hold the title. But when Imogen agrees to accompany Gabe to a masquerade...whose masked eyes watch her with that intense look of desire? Who exactly is she dancing with? The duke or the shadow duke? Rafe . . . or Gabe?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/83/9780060781583.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Taming of the Duke (Essex Sisters, book 3)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.44 Pounds, Width: 1 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.44}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2006-03-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Sisters', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Scottish', 'Victorian', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Eloisa James'], 'title': 'The Taming of the Duke (Essex Sisters, book 3)', 'isbn13': '9780060781583', 'msrp': 4.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061800333', 'ePub': '0061800333'}, 'isbn': '0060781580', 'isbn10': '0060781580', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061800337', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
