Spanning the duration of Cheever’s long and distinguished career, these sixty-one stories chronicle and encapsulate the lives of what has been called “the greatest generation.”<br/><br/>From the early wonder and disillusionment of city life in “The Enormous Radio” to the surprising discoveries and common mysteries of suburbia in “The Housebreaker of Shady Hill” and “The Swimmer,” these are tales that have helped define the form. Featuring a preface by the Pulizter Prize-winning author, The Stories of John Cheever brings together some of the finest short stories ever written.<br/><br/>"Cheever’s crowning achievement is the ability to be simultaneously generous and cynical, to see that the absurd and the profound can reside in the same moment, and to acknowledge both at the detriment of neither." —The Guardian", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/28/9780375724428.jpg", "title_long": "The Stories of John Cheever", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 1.09 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.16}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.12}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.09}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 704, "date_published": "2000-05-16", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John Cheever'], 'title": "The Stories of John Cheever", "isbn13": "9780375724428", "msrp": 18.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307743985", "ePub": "0307743985"}, "isbn": "0375724427", "isbn10": "0375724427", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307743985", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
