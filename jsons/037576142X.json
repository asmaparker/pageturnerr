{"book": {"publisher": "Dial Press Trade Paperback", "synopsis": "In this sweeping epic of the northernmost American frontier, James A. Michener guides us through Alaska’s fierce terrain and history, from the long-forgotten past to the bustling present. As his characters struggle for survival, Michener weaves together the exciting high points of Alaska’s story: its brutal origins; the American acquisition; the gold rush; the tremendous growth and exploitation of the salmon industry; the arduous construction of the Alcan Highway, undertaken to defend the territory during World War II. A spellbinding portrait of a human community fighting to establish its place in the world, Alaska traces a bold and majestic saga of the enduring spirit of a land and its people.<br/><br/>Praise for Alaska<br/><br/>“Few will escape the allure of the land and people [Michener] describes. . . .

The characters that Michener creates are bigger than life.”—Los Angeles Times Book Review<br/><br/>“Always the master of exhaustive historical research, Michener tracks the settling of Alaska [in] vividly detailed scenes and well-developed characters.”—Boston Herald<br/><br/>“Michener is still, sentence for sentence, writing’s fastest attention grabber.”—The New York Times", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/23/9780375761423.jpg", "title_long": "Alaska: A Novel", "edition": "NO-VALUE", "dimensions": "Height: 8.27 Inches, Length: 5.57 Inches, Weight: 1.5873282864 Pounds, Width: 1.69 inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.52}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.63}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.57410055068}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.28}}, "pages": 1152, "date_published": "2002-11-12", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["James A.
