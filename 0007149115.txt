{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins Publishers Limited', 'synopsis': "For the first time in A-format paperback, J.R.R. Tolkien's novella about the adventures of a bewitched toy dog While on holiday in 1925, four-year-old Michael Tolkien lost his beloved toy dog on the beach at Filey in Yorkshire. To console him, his father, J.R.R.Tolkien, improvised a story about Rover, a real dog who is magically transformed into a toy and is forced to seek out the wizard who wronged him in order to be returned to normal. This charming tale, peopled by a sand-sorcerer and a terrible dragon, by the king of the sea and the Man-in-the-Moon, went through several drafts over the years. Now, more than 70 years on, the adventures of Rover -- or, for reasons that become clear in the story, 'Roverandom' -- are published in A format for the first time. Rich in wit and wordplay, Roverandom is edited and introduced by Christina Scull and Wayne G. Hammond and includes Tolkien's own delightful illustrations.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/17/9780007149117.jpg', 'title_long': 'Roverandom', 'edition': 'later printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.97 Inches, Length: 4.33 Inches, Weight: 0.18077905484 pounds, Width: 0.35 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.33}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.35}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.18077905484}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.97}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['J.
