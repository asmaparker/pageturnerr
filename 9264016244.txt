{'book': {'publisher': 'Organization for Economic', 'synopsis': '<p><P>The "African Economic Outlook" is a joint project between the African Development Bank and the OECD Development Centre. The project, generously supported by the European Commission, combines the expertise accumulated by the OECD, which produces the "OECD Economic Outlook" twice a year, and the knowledge of the African Development Bank on African economies. The objective is to review annually the recent economic situation and the short-term likely evolutions of selected African countries. The Outlook is drawn from a country-by-country analysis based on a unique analytical design. This common framework includes a forecasting exercise for the current and the two following years using a simple macroeconomic model, together with an analysis of the social and political context. It also contains a comparative synthesis of African country prospects, placing the evolution of African economies in the world economic context. A statistical appendix completes the volume. Decision makers in African and OECD countries, both in the public and private sectors, such as aid agencies, investors, and government officials of aid-recipient countries, will all find this volume of significant interest.</p>', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/48/9789264016248.jpg', 'title_long': 'African Economic Outlook, 2003/2004', 'dimensions': 'height: 260 mm, length: 197 mm, width: 19 mm, weight: 839 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 197}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 19}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 839}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 260}}, 'pages': 426, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic Conditions', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development'], 'title': 'African Economic Outlook, 2003/2004', 'isbn13': '9789264016248', 'msrp': 95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9264016244', 'isbn10': '9264016244'}}
