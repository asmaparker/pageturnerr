{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Everyone knows that all the members of the St. John family are destined for greatness - all, that is, except the rebellious Chase St. John. Then, as the fates would have it, a lifetime of drinking, gambling and womanising catches up and leads him to a fateful incident which changes his life. Harriet Ward, on the other hand, has always felt the weight of responsibility caring for her mother and two brothers, but drawing the line at marrying a stuffy bore to save her home, she creates an imaginary fiance, Captain John. There is no one more surprised than she when Chase conveniently shows up, wounded by an unknown attacker, to fill the role of her suitor. As they pose as lovers and begin to unravel the mystery of Chase's assailant, they soon realise that their imaginary love has quickly turned into reality.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/51/9780060514051.jpg', 'title_long': 'How to Treat a Lady (Talisman Ring)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-11-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Karen Hawkins'], 'title': 'How to Treat a Lady (Talisman Ring)', 'isbn13': '9780060514051', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061745669'}, 'isbn': '0060514051', 'isbn10': '0060514051', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061745669', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
