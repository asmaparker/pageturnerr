{'book': {'publisher': 'Schirmer Reference', 'synopsis': "From Library Journal      This dictionary provides data for 4000 pianists, but it has its problems. Many of the entries (excepting less-known pi anists) can also be found in standard sources such as Groves, Bakers, and Thompson. Entries are sometimes sketchy, ambiguous, and inconsistent. For example, Arthur Foote is noted as being born in Salem, USA (there are 17 Salems in the U.S.); F. Rzewski in Massachusetts, USA. Likewise, there are curious inaccuracies. Wiktor La bunski's death date is given as 1966 while Groves and Bakers state it cor rectly as 1974. Furthermore, readers may find many abbreviations in the text confusing (Strasfogel is noted as per forming with the ``New York PO''). Despite the uneven treatment, the work would be useful for verifying little- known pianists; thus, recommended for larger music reference collections. J. Richard Belanger, Susquehanna Univ.
