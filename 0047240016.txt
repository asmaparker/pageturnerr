{'book': {'publisher': 'Routledge, Chapman & Hall, Incorporated', 'synopsis': "This beautifully illustrated, closely argued, pioneering, and definitive magisterial survey spans over two thousand years and analyzes the astonishing and persistent influence that Ancient Egyptian culture has had on the West. Professor Stevens Curl describes in lively and stimulating prose the numerous revivals of the Egyptian style from Antiquity to the present day, drawing on a wealth of sources.The author deftly develops his argument that the civilization of Ancient Egypt is central, rather than peripheral, to the development of much of Western architecture, art, design, and religion. He charts the remarkable persistence of Egyptian motifs in design from Graeco-Roman Antiquity, through the Mediaeval, Baroque, and Neo-Classical periods, and goes on to trace the rise of Egyptology in the nineteenth century, twentieth-century manifestations of Egyptianisms prompted by the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, and various aspects of Egyptianising tendencies in the Art Deco style and afterwards.For students of art, architectural and ancient history, and those interested in Western European culture generally, this book will be an inspiring and invaluable addition to the available literature.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/10/9780047240010.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Egyptian revival: An introductory study of a recurring theme in the history of taste', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.8959754532 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.8959754532}}, 'pages': 249, 'date_published': '1982', 'subjects': ['History', 'Middle East', 'Egypt'], 'authors': ['James Stevens Curl'], 'title': 'The Egyptian revival: An introductory study of a recurring theme in the history of taste', 'isbn13': '9780047240010', 'msrp': 6.4, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0047240016', 'isbn10': '0047240016', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781134234677', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
