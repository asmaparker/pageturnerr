{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': 'One issue energy users must understand is how deregulation of the electric and gas industries will effect them. This book can help users understand the forces behind deregulation and how they can use deregulation now to negotiate lower utility rates even before deregulation takes full effect. They will also learn how to coordinate new rate packages with managing their in-plant loads more effectively to multiply their savings. Due to downsizing and restructuring, many companies no longer have the in-house expertise to implement an effective program. This book will provide that expertise and will also prove immensely helpful to larger companies as well. Topics covered include the current state of deregulation, preparing for successful electric and gas negotiations, and negotiating procedures and techniques. Case studies are also included.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/28/9780130126528.jpg', 'title_long': 'Guide to Purchasing Electricity and Gas', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 163, 'date_published': '1999-05-07', 'subjects': ['Law', 'Administrative Law', 'Public Utilities', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Electrical & Electronics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Paul R.
