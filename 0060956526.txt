{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'In Life Without Limits, Bassett asks, "If you could have, do, and be anything right now, what would you ask for?" Eight out of ten people are unable to answer this simple question.<br/>How about you? Do you know how to get what you want? Do you even know what you want? What do you see when you look in the mirror? A self-confident, radiant person who is living life to the fullest? Or do you see a frustrated, insecure, dissatisfied person who doesn\'t know how to change things? Bassett says, "In my work, I am continually amazed at the number of people who are personally, professionally, and financially frustrated. But the worst part is, if they could change things, they aren\'t sure how, or even what they would change." People stop dreaming, settling for a life that is neither satisfying nor rewarding because their fears and insecurities prevent them from seeing what they want in life, and how to get it. Acquiring happiness, wealth, or success on any level is difficult when you aren\'t clear about what you want and you don\'t have a plan. Before you know it, years pass by, and you\'re looking back with regrets.<br/>"In my work over the past fourteen years, I have encountered two types of people. The first group is the "doers." They are the movers and the shakers. They plan their life and are strongly motivated. They are on a clear path, know exactly what they want, and they are willing to take the risks to get it. The second group is the "drifters." They drift through life with no real sense of direction, ending up frustrated. This can happen to people in the most prestigious occupations. The drifters have a hard time establishing a sense of true happiness, satisfaction, or security because they know they aren\'t where they "should be," but they don\'t know what to do about it.<br/>Life Without Limits helps you clarify what you want in every area of your life. By using Bassett\'s powerful techniques you will change, therefore your life will change. Your thoughts are magnets attracting everything from the type of people you meet to the types of opportunities that come your way. Your thinking must be clear, distinct, and sharply defined. Your focused thoughts elicit emotion; your emotions ignite your actions and have a tremendous effect on the universal energy that surrounds you. You control your life. You control your destiny. And only you can take steps to change it. Life Without Limits helps you take back your power.<br/>Life Without Limits is the complete guide to attaining abundance in every area of your life. It will help you to achieve satisfaction and fulfillment personally, professionally, and financially. Once you have defined what success means for you, you will clarify your dreams and start pursuing them. Opportunities will present themselves, new doors will open, and you will begin to live the life you were meant to live: a life without limits.<br/>"Begin now to change the person you are into the person you know you have the potential to become." -- Lucinda Bassett', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/23/9780060956523.jpg', 'title_long': 'Life Without Limits: Conquer Your Fears, Achieve Your Dreams, and Make Yourself Happy', 'edition': '1st', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.44974301448 pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.44974301448}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Motivational', 'Success', 'Business & Money', 'Job Hunting & Careers', 'Guides', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting'], 'authors': ['Lucinda Bassett'], 'title': 'Life Without Limits: Conquer Your Fears, Achieve Your Dreams, and Make Yourself Happy', 'isbn13': '9780060956523', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Electronics', 'isbn': '0060956526', 'isbn10': '0060956526'}}
