{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Scandal's daughter . . .<br/>Madeleine Willits was shunned by London society for a scandal that was no fault of hers, and forced to seek a paid position in the country. So when Quinlan Bancroft, Marquis of Warefield, comes to direct the household during his uncle's illness, Maddie is determined to detest the nobleman on sight. But though the marquis is easy to dislike, the man himself is a different matter. Small wonder, then, that Maddie quite forgets herself when he enfolds her in a sweet embrace . . .<br/>Meets the noble lord . . .<br/>Caught kissing his uncle's lovely young companion, Quinlan feels he should make amends, and uses his rank to re-establish Miss Willits in society. Unfortunately, it is soon apparent that Maddie has no idea how to resist importunate young rakes who deem her ripe for the plucking. But Maddie knows there is only one rake whose attentions she truly needs to fearâ€”because only Quinlan Bancroft possesses the power to break her heart.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/51/9780060875251.jpg', 'title_long': 'By Love Undone (The Bancroft Brothers, 1)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.00089866948}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-09-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Suzanne Enoch'], 'title': 'By Love Undone (The Bancroft Brothers, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780060875251', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006197935X'}, 'isbn': '0060875259', 'isbn10': '0060875259', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061979354', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
