{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "A brilliant follow-up to Hidden Lives, Margaret Forster's most personal book yet takes up the story of her gritty, northern father, Arthur, intertwined with that of her sister-in-law, Marion, who died of cancer at almost half the age of the 96 year-old Arthur. Margaret Forster's father was not a man to answer questions - least of all questions about life and death, so she attempts to answer them for herself. As Forster looks back at Arthur's life and indomitable character, she evokes incidents from her childhood, his working life and stubborn old age, trying to make sense of their largely unspoken relationship, and of his tenacious hold on life, and on his family. Arthur and Marion's lives were ordinary, and apparently unremarkable, but, when faced with death, lives like these become strangely precious.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/49/9780099275749.jpg', 'title_long': 'Precious Lives', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.39903669422 Pounds, Width: 0.62992 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.62992}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.39903669422}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 232, 'date_published': '1999', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Margaret Forster'], 'title': 'Precious Lives', 'isbn13': '9780099275749', 'msrp': 7.49, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099275740', 'isbn10': '0099275740'}}
