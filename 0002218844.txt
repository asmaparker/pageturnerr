{'book': {'publisher': 'Collins', 'synopsis': 'A man who dies and goes to Heaven nowadays expects something a little more sophisticated than gold streets and angels playing harps. He wants a place designed for his own individual needs and tastes – somewhere that allows for personal development and rich human relations – somewhere you can win. Here’s Howard Baker’s heaven. It may be yours.Long regarded as a classic in Great Britain, Michael Frayn’s comic fantasy Sweet Dreams (1973) returns to print in the U.S. for the first time in decades in this edition, which features a new introduction by the author.WHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING“Frayn has a most unusual talent. His books seem so deceptively simple, but they linger in the mind for years, and can be re-read with the greatest pleasure. Sweet Dreams is no exception.” – Margaret Drabble, New York Times Book Review“May go down in history as one of England’s special contributions to the twentieth century.” – Times Literary Supplement“Frayn is an impeccable writer . . . his novel is a kind of Candide – a vividly contemporary Candide – full of the most serious high comedy and the most enormous belly laughs.” – New Yorker', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/49/9780002218849.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sweet dreams', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.83996121822 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.83996121822}}, 'pages': 223, 'date_published': '1973', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['Michael Frayn'], 'title': 'Sweet dreams', 'isbn13': '9780002218849', 'msrp': 117.75, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0002218844', 'isbn10': '0002218844'}}
