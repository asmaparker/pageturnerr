{'book': {'publisher': 'see notes for publisher info', 'synopsis': "Here is Royal Britain as never seen before, looking down through the cameraman's lens at the historic buildings and landscapes which represent our royal heritage. Jason Hawkes, a photographer of extraordinary talent, has spent the last year flying by helicopter over the country, searching for places with historic royal associations and recording them in beautifully evocative compositions. The royal palaces - Balmoral, Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace and others - are seen from a view the public never sees, and their architectural grandeur and dignity marvellously portrayed. The great churches and cathedrals - St Paul's, Westminster Abbey and the rest -are included, in addition to hundreds of other stately homes, public buildings, towns and rural landscapes which have played some part in Britain's royal history. Each photograph is informatively captioned by Jane Struthers, pinpointing what can be seen in it and outlining its place in history.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/44/9780091771744.jpg', 'title_long': 'Royal Britain from the Air', 'edition': '1st ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 12 Inches, Weight: 2.56177148444 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.56177148444}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.5}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '1994', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Photography & Video', 'Collections, Catalogues & Exhibitions', 'Architecture', 'Business & Money', 'History', 'Europe', 'Travel', 'Food, Lodging & Transportation', 'Air Travel'], 'authors': ['STRUTHERS,Jane'], 'title': 'Royal Britain from the Air', 'isbn13': '9780091771744', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0091771749', 'isbn10': '0091771749'}}
