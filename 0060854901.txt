{'book': {'publisher': 'Rayo', 'synopsis': "Julie Stav has long made a name for herself as a financial guru with a solid media platform, and the know-how to make right your financial wrongs.<br/>With her most fun and mass appealing book to date, Stav points her financial acumen on what she considers the financial universe's 5 existing financial personality types<br/>Structured much in the same way the signs of the Zodiac are organized (with each Zodiac sign representing its own set of character traitsâ€”both strengths AND weaknesses), THE MONEY IN YOU! segments 5 different financial types in this world, and why all of us fit into one more than we do the others. It is our understanding of our financial nature, or the way we innately view money matters, that drives our financial decisions. Mastering this nature is the key to unlocking our financial success.<br/>Once Stav helps readers figure out which best defines us, she then helps to create a solid plan around who we are, rather than change us with advice our financial nature is sure to reject. She also teaches the reader how to interract with the other financial types around us, in the relationships that are most important to us.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/04/9780060854904.jpg', 'title_long': "The Money in You!: Discover Your Financial Personality and Live the Millionaire's Life", 'edition': 'English Language', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.85}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2006-07-03', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Personal Finance'], 'authors': ['Julie Stav'], 'title': "The Money in You!: Discover Your Financial Personality and Live the Millionaire's Life", 'isbn13': '9780060854904', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060854901', 'isbn10': '0060854901'}}
