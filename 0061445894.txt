Queen Victoria, barely eighteen, has just ascended to the throne of England, and a young woman named Liberty Lane has just had her first taste of true sorrow. Refusing to accept that her gentle, peace-loving father has been killed fighting a duel, she vows to see justice done. . . .<br/>The trail she follows is a twisting and dangerous one, leading the spirited young Englishwoman into an intricate weave of conspiracy. Contacted by secret agents, she is asked to pose as a governess in order to infiltrate cold, rambling Mandeville Hall and spy on its master, Sir Herbert Mandeville, who is at the center of a treasonous plan.<br/>Nothing at the hall is what it seems, and every turn reveals another deceit, another surprise, another peril, leaving Libby to wonder who to trust and embroiling her in a deadly affair that could destroy the young queen and place Libby herself in mortal peril. . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/97/9780061445897.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Foreign Affair', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.79}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.58}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2008-03-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Political', "Women's Fiction", 'British & Irish', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Caro Peacock'], 'title': 'A Foreign Affair', 'isbn13': '9780061445897', 'msrp': 12.04, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0061445894', 'isbn10': '0061445894'}}
