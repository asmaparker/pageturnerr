{'book': {'publisher': 'FAO', 'synopsis': 'Product Description      Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) represents a major obstacle to cattle production in Africa and elsewhere. The disease appeared to be under control but made a spectacular comeback about a decade ago affecting areas previously known to be free from infection and disease. The effect of CBPP on cattle population in newly affected areas is devastating. Chronically affected areas suffer from decreased cattle productivity and lingering deaths.
