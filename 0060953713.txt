{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "It's been years since Swenson, a professor in a New England creative writing program, has published a novel. It's been even longer since any of his students have shown promise. Enter Angela Argo, a pierced, tattooed student with a rare talent for writing. Angela is just the thing Swenson needs. And, better yet, she wants his help. But, as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions...<br/>Deliciously risque, Blue Angel is a withering take on today's academic mores and a scathing tale that vividly shows what can happen when academic politics collides with political correctness.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/13/9780060953713.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blue Angel: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.53 Pounds, Width: 0.756757 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.756757}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.53}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 314, 'date_published': '2001-03-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Francine Prose'], 'title': 'Blue Angel: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060953713', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060953713', 'isbn10': '0060953713'}}
