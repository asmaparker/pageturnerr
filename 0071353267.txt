{'book': {'publisher': 'Intl Marine Pub', 'synopsis': 'A lyrical voyage of self discovery for all sailors. Sailors are interested as much in the journey as the destination. This collection of thirty beautifully written and evocative vignettes and the simple lessons they convey will appeal to any sailor--or anyone who knows a sailor. Familiar yet profound, these observations reaffirm why time on the water is time well spent. Migael Scherer offers vivid glimpses of life aboard--of trimming sails, anchoring, making repairs, being fogbound--that convey bold, simple, thought-provoking truths. And she reflects on what her boat and the sea have taught her: a zen-like wisdom and peace of mind, flexibility in the face of chaos, a deeper appreciation of the richness of each moment. All in all, this is a marvelous affirmation of the beauty of sailing.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/67/9780071353267.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sailing to Simplicity: Life Lessons Learned at Sea', 'edition': 'First American Edition.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.7054792384 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7054792384}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '1999-09-20', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Water Sports', 'Boating'], 'authors': ['Migael Scherer'], 'title': 'Sailing to Simplicity: Life Lessons Learned at Sea', 'isbn13': '9780071353267', 'msrp': 17.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0071353267', 'isbn10': '0071353267'}}
