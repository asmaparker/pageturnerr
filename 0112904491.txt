{'book': {'publisher': 'The Stationery Office/Tso', 'synopsis': 'From Library Journal<br/><br/>The objects in this catalog were collected from a variety of departments in the Victoria & Albert Museum, since there is not a Judaica department as such. After a brief discussion of collecting and exhibiting Judaic art in England, the work is divided into four parts: Public Worship and the Synagogue, Festivals and Holy Days, Domestic Worship and Observance, and Costumes and Miscellaneous Items. Each section includes an introduction, photographs, and discussion of the provenance, iconography, and ritual role of the objects pictured. The text, which includes discussion of many Hebrew inscriptions, is supported by an array of footnotes; there is a glossary of terms and a select bibliography. The work is beautifully illustrated with clear, precise photos. It is as complete a catalog as one could imagine and therefore a welcome addition to the literature in the field. Recommended for specialists as well as informed general readers.<br/>- Martin Chasin, Adult Inst., Bridgeport, Ct.<br/>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/96/9780112904496.jpg', 'title_long': 'Jewish Ritual Art in the Victoria and Albert Museum', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.25 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 2.05 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.25}}, 'pages': 132, 'date_published': '1990', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Collections, Catalogs & Exhibitions'], 'authors': ['Michael Keen'], 'title': 'Jewish Ritual Art in the Victoria and Albert Museum', 'isbn13': '9780112904496', 'msrp': 59.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0112904491', 'isbn10': '0112904491'}}
