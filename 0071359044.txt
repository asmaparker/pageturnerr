{'book': {'publisher': 'McGraw-Hill', 'synopsis': "Written in an extremely lucid, informative style with vivid graphics and illustrations, The Essential Guide to Your 401(k) objectively guides you through all the complexities and opportunities of 401(k) plans. Nearly 35 million people have 401(k), 403(b) or other defined contribution plans, which have replaced more traditional pensions and Social Security as a primary source of retirement income. Yet few who have these plans, whose value can total hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars, truly understand the intricacies of these plans, the many benefits to exploit, and the many pitfalls to avoid. Despite the reams of information available to people with these plans, many don't know which investments to make, how to determine if their investments are performing well, or the best choices to make when they change jobs, borrow against the plan, or retire and begin withdrawing from their account. Making the wrong choice can mean huge tax consequences, or even penalties.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/47/9780071359047.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Essential Guide to Your 401(k)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.58642961692 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.58642961692}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2001-02-15', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Investing'], 'authors': ['Kenneth M.
