In Your Sacred Self, Dyer offers a program that helps listeners establish a spiritually-oriented, rather than an ego-oriented, approach to life. Step by step, Dyer shows us how to progress from emotional awareness to psychological insight to spiritual alternatives in order to change our experience of life from the need to acquire to a sense of abundance; from a sense of one's self as sinful and inferior to a sense of one's self as divine; from a need to achieve and acquire to an awareness that detachment and letting go bring freedom.<br/>Your Sacred Self is an inspiring, hopeful, illuminating guide that can help everyone live a happier, richer, more meaningful life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/32/9780060935832.jpg', 'title_long': 'Your Sacred Self: Making the Decision to Be Free', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.9 Inches, Length: 8.01 Inches, Weight: 0.6393405598 Pounds, Width: 5.34 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.01}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.34}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6393405598}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.9}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2001-06', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Self-Esteem', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Alternative Medicine', 'Meditation', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Wayne W.
