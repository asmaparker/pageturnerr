By Gregory Maguire, previously author of the bestselling WICKED. ISBN 978-0-06-054892-6. In this much-anticipated third volume of the Wicked Years, we return to Oz, seen now through the eyes of the Cowardly Lion - the once tiny cub defended by Elphaba in Wicked. While civil war looms, a tetchy oracle named Yackle prepares for death. Before her final hour, an enigmatic figure known as Brrr - the Cowardly Lion - arrives searching for information about Elphaba Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the West. As payment, Yackle demands some answers of her own. Brrr surrenders his story: abandoned as a cub, his earliest memories are gluey hazes, and his life's path is no Yellow Brick Road. A Lion Among Men chronicles a battle of wits hastened by the Emerald City's approaching armies. At once a portrait of a would-be survivor and a panoramic glimpse of a world gone shrill with war fever, Gregory Maguire's new novel is written with the sympathy and power that have made his books contemporary classics.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/26/9780060548926.jpg', 'title_long': 'LION AMONG MEN (REMAINDER)', 'edition': '1st', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 312, 'date_published': '2013', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Mythology & Folk Tales', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors': ['GREGORY MAGUIRE'], 'title': 'LION AMONG MEN (REMAINDER)', 'isbn13': '9780060548926', 'msrp': 26.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060548924', 'isbn10': '0060548924'}}
