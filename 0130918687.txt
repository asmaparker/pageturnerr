Exceptional in scholarship and pedagogically in tune with the needs of today's students-rich but never effete-Marilyn Stokstad's Art History is the art history text of choice for a new generation of teachers and students. Presenting a broad view of art through the centuries, it introduces beginning students in a positive and sympathetic manner to the works of all artists. This includes women and artists of color, and the arts of other continents and regions in addition to those of Western Europe and the United States. Balancing both the traditions of art history and new trends of the present, Art History is the most comprehensive, accessible, and magnificently illustrated work of its kind.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/80/9780130918680.jpg', 'title_long': 'Art History (2 Volumes)', 'edition': '2nd Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.811 Inches, Length: 8.93699 Inches, Weight: 8.7523518014 Pounds, Width: 2.3622 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.93699}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 2.3622}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 8.7523518014}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.811}}, 'pages': 1248, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Architecture'], 'authors': ['Marilyn Stokstad'], 'title': 'Art History (2 Volumes)', 'isbn13': '9780130918680', 'msrp': 105, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0130918687', 'isbn10': '0130918687'}}
