As the first genetically altered human-idomeni hybrid, former Captain Jani Kilian serves as a lightning rod for the anger, outrage, and hatreds of both sides. And now the ex-soldier finds herself in the unwanted role of diplomatâ€”serving the interests of her hybrid enclave, Thalassa, the only place in the universe that welcomes renegade humans, hybrids, and aliens alike.<br/>But the all-powerful Commonwealth intends to bring Thalassa to its knees, and the time for diplomacy is at an end. With death surrounding her, Jani Kilian must return to where her nightmare began and once again take on her most powerful persona: warrior. For as the game approaches its inevitable conclusion, she knows only two options remain: victory . . . or extermination.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/98/9780060503598.jpg', 'title_long': 'Endgame (Jani Kilian series)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 404, 'date_published': '2007-10-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['Kristine Smith'], 'title': 'Endgame (Jani Kilian series)', 'isbn13': '9780060503598', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061979406'}, 'isbn': '0060503599', 'isbn10': '0060503599', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061979408', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
