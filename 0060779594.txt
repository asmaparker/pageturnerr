{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperPB', 'synopsis': 'When Joe Trippi signed on to run Howard Dean\'s 2004 presidential campaign, the long–shot candidate had 432 known supporters and $100,000 in the bank. Within a year, Trippi and his team had transformed the most obscure candidate in the field into a Democratic front–runner with a groundswell of 640,000 supporters and more money than any Democrat in history –– mostly through donations of one hundred dollars or less. Trippi\'s revolutionary use of the Internet and an impassioned, contagious desire to overthrow politics as usual grew into a national grassroots movement and changed the face of politics forever.<br/>As Trippi argues persuasively, the Internet is distributing power to the people right now. And the companies that understand the coming revolution will be the first movers in this new era, while those that wait will be left behind. From his behind–the–scenes look at Dean\'s shocking rise and fall to his "seven inviolable, irrefutable, ingenious things your business or institution or candidate can do in the age of the Internet that might keep you from getting your ass kicked, but then again might not," Joe Trippi offers an inspiring glimpse of the world we are becoming. And he shows how power, in the hands of all of us, changes everything.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/97/9780060779597.jpg', 'title_long': 'Revolution Will Not Be Televised, The', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.82 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.82}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 252, 'date_published': '2005-07-05', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Skills', 'Communications', 'Computers & Technology', 'Networking & Cloud Computing', 'Internet, Groupware, & Telecommunications', 'Internet & Social Media', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Science & Math', 'Technology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Elections & Political Process'], 'authors': ['Joe Trippi'], 'title': 'Revolution Will Not Be Televised, The', 'isbn13': '9780060779597', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060779594', 'isbn10': '0060779594'}}
