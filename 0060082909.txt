Of course it was not her specific intention to hire one as devastatingly handsome as Andrew "MacGregor."

Protecting the lovely, independent Miranda will not be easy, for the lady must notice how he is always there to rescue her from the increasingly troubling "accidents" in her home. And surely she can feel the heat of the passion she inspires within him –– which may prove a fatal distraction, now that he\'s drawn the unsuspecting beauty into a most dangerous game...', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/01/9780060082901.jpg', 'title_long': 'Scandalous Miranda', 'edition': '1st', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2005-11-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Susan Sizemore'], 'title': 'Scandalous Miranda', 'isbn13': '9780060082901', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060082909', 'isbn10': '0060082909'}}
