The premise behind Marketing: Best Practices is simple yet effective: combine the expertise of the best and brightest in marketing. The second edition continues the tradition of highlighting the best practices from every facet of marketing. Each chapter is written by an authority in their field of marketing, all of whom are highly regarded for both academic and professional achievements. This unique collaboration results in one of the most cutting-edge texts to hit the principles market in years. Dr. Doug Hoffman, in addition to his chapter on Services Marketing, served as managing editor to ensure a focused and streamlined presentation throughout the book. Without losing the distinct flavor of each contributing author, every chapter is consistent in both format and pedagogy. The writing style is uniform and targeted for the undergraduate level. Cutting-edge topics drive the Opening Vignettes, and the copy maintains a lively, energetic tone. The end result is a solid mix of passion, insight, and firsthand experience not typically found in more traditional "Principles of Marketing" textbooks.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/97/9780030349997.jpg', 'title_long': 'Marketing: Best Practices', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11 Inches, Length: 8.75 Inches, Weight: 3.60014873846 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.60014873846}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11}}, 'pages': 650, 'date_published': '2002-07-09', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Marketing', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['K.
