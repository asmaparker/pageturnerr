{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': 'Millions of American women live in fear that they are easy targets for criminal attack, and the statistics are indeed alarming: 73 percent of women over the age of 12 will be victimized at some point -- more than one third of them violently raped, robbed or assaulted. For more than three years, Tanya Metaksa has been teaching women how to take safety into their own hands in her revolutionary program, Refuse to Be a Victim. Now, in Safe, Not Sorry, she brings her message of empowerment to women who have come to realize that neither 911 nor the legal system will protect them in an increasingly violent age. This complete guide to self-protection shows how to develop proactive strategies for personal and family safety at home, on the street, in the car and at work. Metaksa discusses self-defense, physical training and personal protection devices, the pros and cons of firearms and the most current information on laws from state to state -- and what women can do to change legislation and be heard by their elected officials. Safe, Not Sorry is the ultimate self-protection handbook.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/11/9780060391911.jpg', 'title_long': 'Safe, Not Sorry: Keeping Yourself and Your Family Safe in a Violent Age', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '1997-05-01', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors': ['Tanya Metaksa'], 'title': 'Safe, Not Sorry: Keeping Yourself and Your Family Safe in a Violent Age', 'isbn13': '9780060391911', 'msrp': 23, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '006039191X', 'isbn10': '006039191X'}}
