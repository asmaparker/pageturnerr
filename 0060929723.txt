{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': 'At age sixty-five, retired anthropologist Stella Brentwood buys a cottage in Somerset, England, and slowly acquires neighbors, a dog, and a professional curiosity about the country village where she intends to settle and put down roots for the first time. She has spent her life studying communities of people--their families, social structures, how they welcome outsiders into their midst-remaining an observer, privileged to share in their intimate life but not obliged, and finally unwilling to tie herself closely to any lover, friend, or social group. In Somerset, Stella once again finds an opportunity to become part of the web of relationships that make for human society, as well as a chance at true friendship and love. How will independent-minded Stella, Lays reluctant to make an emotional commitment, respond? Written in exquisitely nuanced prose, Spiderweb is a captivating and deeply moving novel, a brilliant vision of our modern experience.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/25/9780060929725.jpg', 'title_long': 'Spiderweb: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.46 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.46}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 218, 'date_published': '2000-03-22', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Small Town & Rural', 'Friendship', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Penelope Lively'], 'title': 'Spiderweb: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060929725', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060929723', 'isbn10': '0060929723'}}
