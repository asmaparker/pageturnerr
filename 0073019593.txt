{'book': {'publisher': 'McGraw-Hill Education', 'synopsis': 'Supplementary Materials to Accompany Puntos de Partida<br/>From the first edition to the present edition, one of the most important features of the Supplementary Materials is the built-in recycling of linguistic functions. In this edition besides the “Guided Writing” re-entry activities, and the “Communicative Goals” speaking practices, we have added a section called “Recycling of Major Linguistic Functions” which was previously in the Teacher’s Guide and as is now in the student Supplement. We have also added suggestions about how to incorporate student-initiated questions into picture-based activities. All activities have been updated to reflect the changes to the new edition of Puntos and current Hispanic popular culture.<br/>What will you find in the new Supplementary Materials and the accompanying Teacher’s Guide?<br/>• Communicative Goals and Grammatical Structures Checklists<br/>• Pronunciation<br/>• Listening Comprehension<br/>• Grammar<br/>• Chapter Reviews<br/>• Integrative and Information Gap Activities<br/>• Guided Writing<br/>• Communicative Goals Practices<br/>• Round Robin Grammar Monitor Activities<br/>• Recycling of Major Linguistic Functions<br/>• Games<br/>The Supplementary Materials and Teacher’s Guide are meant, first and foremost, to be a time-saver when doing lesson plans. Here, in one manual, you will find a wide range of imaginative, classroom-tested materials and activities, designed by experienced teachers who have taught extensively with Puntos de partida. It is our earnest hope that this supplement and teacher’s guide will make teachers’ lives easier when planning classes, and that students find the materials interesting, enjoyable and beneficial.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/98/9780073019598.jpg', 'title_long': 'LSC CPS1 () : CPSJ Supplementary Material t/a Puntos de Partida', 'edition': '6', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.8 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 1.33 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.33}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.8}}, 'pages': 282, 'date_published': '2004-05-25', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Sharon W.
