{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': 'Classic Italian Jewish Cooking starts with the ancient Italian adage Vesti da turco e mangia da ebreo ("Dress like a Turk and eat like a Jew"). In this definitive volume of Italian Jewish recipes, Edda Servi Machlin, a native of Pitigliano, Italy, a Tuscan village that was once home to a vibrant Jewish community, reveals the secrets of this delicate and unique culinary tradition that has flourished for more than two thousand years.<br/>Originally introduced into the region by Jewish settlers from Judea, other Middle Eastern countries, and North Africa, Italian Jewish cuisine was always more than a mere adaptation of Italian dishes to the Jewish dietary laws; it was a brilliant marriage of ancient Jewish dishes and preparation methods to the local ingredients that relied on the imaginative use of fresh herbs, fruit, and vegetables. Fifteen hundred years later, with the influx of Iberian refugees, it was enriched by some Sephardic (from Spain and Portugal) dishes.<br/>Here you\'ll find recipes for the quintessential Italian Jewish dishes -- from Goose "Ham," Spicy Chicken Liver Toasts, and Jewish Caponata to Sabbath Saffron Rice, Purim Ravioli, and Tagliatelle Jewish Style (Noodle Kugel); from Creamed Baccal√†, Red Snapper Jewish Style, and Artichokes Jewish Style to Creamed Fennel and Fried Squash Flowers; from Couscous Salad and Sourdough Challah Bread to Haman\'s Ears, Honey Cake, and Passover Almond Biscotti.<br/>Selected from Edda Servi Machlin\'s three widely admired books on Italian Jewish cuisine and filled with beautifully rendered memories from her birthplace, this rare collection of more than three hundred recipes is a powerful tribute to a rich cultural heritage and a rare gift to food lovers. With a special section on Jewish holiday menus, Classic Italian Jewish Cooking is a volume to treasure for generations.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/28/9780060758028.jpg', 'title_long': 'Classic Italian Jewish Cooking: Traditional Recipes and Menus', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 inches, Length: 7.5 inches, Weight: 2 Pounds, Width: 1.25 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2005-04-26', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Regional & International', 'European', 'Special Diet', 'Kosher'], 'authors': ['Edda Servi Machlin'], 'title': 'Classic Italian Jewish Cooking: Traditional Recipes and Menus', 'isbn13': '9780060758028', 'msrp': 29.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060758023', 'isbn10': '0060758023'}}
