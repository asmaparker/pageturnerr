{'book': {'publisher': 'Amistad', 'synopsis': "Hailed upon publication by writers and critics alike, including Shirley Hazzard and Charles Johnson, Let the Lion Eat Straw is a dazzling novel that tells the story of Abeba Williams, whose mother abandons the poverty of the South –– and in the process her daughter –– for opportunities up North. Missing her mother, she clings to Mamma Habblesham, a woman with enviable reserves of love and hope. Their affection for each other seems boundless –– until Abeba's mother returns to take her to Brooklyn.<br/>As Abeba grows up, her exceptional musical talent promises to be an avenue of escape. But a handsome singer distracts her, and opportunities that once seemed so close begin to fall away. Now married with children of her own, she fights to maintain the dignity of her family. Let the Lion Eat Straw is a revelation of the glory in apparently ordinary lives.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/14/9780060724214.jpg', 'title_long': 'Let the Lion Eat Straw', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.37 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.44}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.37}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 171, 'date_published': '2005-06-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'United States', 'Black & African American', 'Southern', 'Literary', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Abuse', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Ellease Southerland'], 'title': 'Let the Lion Eat Straw', 'isbn13': '9780060724214', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060724218', 'isbn10': '0060724218'}}
