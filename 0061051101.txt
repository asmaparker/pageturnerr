Though the Iron Lance had been won for the emperor, an even holier relic has been found: the Black Rood—the prayer-worn, blood-stained remnant of the True Cross—now endangered by the greedy ambitions of ruthless crusader barons bent on carving kingdoms from the desert sands of the Middle East.<br/>When Duncan’s life is shattered by tragedy, he sets sail on his own pilgrimage to Jerusalem, following in the footsteps of his father. But the gates to the Holy Land are guarded by the warrior priests known as the Knights Templar. These fearsome guardians hold the key to more than just Duncan’s fate—the very destiny of the West is in their hands.<br/>“HISTORICAL DETAILS BRING THE SETTING TO ROBUST LIFE.”<br/>—Publishers Weekly', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/04/9780061051104.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Black Rood', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 1.28 Inches, Weight: 0.5401325419 Pounds, Width: 4.18 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.28}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.18}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5401325419}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 494, 'date_published': '2001-06-01', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure'], 'authors': ['Stephen R Lawhead'], 'title': 'The Black Rood', 'isbn13': '9780061051104', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061739359'}, 'isbn': '0061051101', 'isbn10': '0061051101', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061739354', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
