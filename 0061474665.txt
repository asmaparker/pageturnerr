{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Voyager', 'synopsis': "Raine's Landing, Massachusetts, can't be located on any map. On the surface it appears an ordinary New England small town, but anyone who stumbles in wants to leave immediately . . . and once gone, they forget they were ever there. Real magic pervades this village of shadows, practiced by powerful adepts descended from the original Salem witches. But a curse has made it impossible for any resident to step beyond the town line. Those born here must die here as well.<br/>Ross Devries and Cassandra Mallory saw their worlds destroyed by magic run amok, and dedicated their lives to keeping supernatural catastrophe at bay. But now a being more terrible than anything they've ever encountered has just crossed over the border—a powerful entity no known magic can defeat; a fierce, ancient god who feeds on terror . . . and blood. A new nightmare is descending upon Raine's Landing—and for Ross, Cass, and the entire trapped population there can be no escape . . . not even in death.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/68/9780061474668.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dark Rain', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2008-09-30', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Tony Richards'], 'title': 'Dark Rain', 'isbn13': '9780061474668', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061474665', 'isbn10': '0061474665'}}
