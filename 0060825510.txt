{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "What's in a name? Apparently everything for Ed Loy, because that's the only information Father Vincent Tyrrell, brother of prominent racehorse trainer F. X. Tyrrell, offers when he asks for Ed's help in finding a missing person. Even the best private eye needs more than just a name, but hard times and a dwindling bank account make it difficult for Loy to say no.<br/>He is not without luck, however. While working another case, Loy discovers a phone number that seems linked to F.X. found on an unidentified body. Thinking it more than a coincidence, he begins digging into the history of the Tyrrells—a history consumed with trading and dealing, gambling and horse breeding—and soon realizes there is more to the family than meets the eye, a suspicion confirmed when two more people with connections to the Tyrrells are killed.<br/>On the eve of one of Ireland's most anticipated sporting events, the four-day Leopardstown Race-course Christmas Festival, all bets are off as Loy pursues a twisted killer on the final leg of a reckless master plan.<br/>In The Price of Blood, Declan Hughes once again paints an arresting portrait of an Ireland not found in any guidebooks. Deadly passions beget dark secrets in a chilling story that will have readers on edge right up to its shocking conclusion.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/15/9780060825515.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Price of Blood: An Irish Novel of Suspense (Ed Loy Novels, 3)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.18 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.05}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.18}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2008-03-18', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Cozy', 'Private Investigators', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Declan Hughes'], 'title': 'The Price of Blood: An Irish Novel of Suspense (Ed Loy Novels, 3)', 'isbn13': '9780060825515', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060825510', 'isbn10': '0060825510'}}
