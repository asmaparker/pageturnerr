{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': '"Take me somewhere -- to wide-open countryside.<br/>Let me redden and blacken my tongue with berries and cherries.<br/>Let me skip with a flip in a trip. Take me somewhere."<br/>In A Nest Full of Stars, James Berry will take you on a memorable trip through all the startling, humorous, sad, happy, painful, and joyful experiences of growing up. Here are birthdays and fireworks, quarrels and making up, and every sort of mood you can imagine. Here are the hills and valleys of friendships and family life. Here is a boy on a train, trying to make all the adults look at their watches. Here is a girl discovering the miracle of her hen\'s hidden nest of eggs and seeing it change into "a mighty nest full of stars." Most of all, here are poems that shake our senses and awaken us to the magic and mysteries all around.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/71/9780060527471.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Nest Full of Stars: Poems', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 5.38 Inches, Weight: 0.613125 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.38}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.54}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.613125}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 104, 'date_published': '2004-03-02', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World'], 'authors': ['James Berry'], 'title': 'A Nest Full of Stars: Poems', 'isbn13': '9780060527471', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060527471', 'isbn10': '0060527471'}}
