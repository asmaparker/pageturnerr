{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Cookbooks', 'synopsis': "A fully revised and updated edition of Raymond Sokolov's classic kitchen primer for beginning chefs of all ages, filled with 150 simple, sophisticated recipes, easy–to–learn techniques, and indispensable advice.<br/>First published in 1986, Ray Sokolov's How To Cook is the ultimate book for beginning cooks of all ages. Unlike most kitchen primers, How To Cook does not assume any prior cooking instruction or skills, but rather guides the reader through the entire cooking process with simple explanations in ordinary language. There are no fancy cooking terms or special gadget here, just easy, indispensable techniques and foolproof recipes for every occasion. In this revised paperback edition, Sokolov addresses the increased sophistication of even adamant non–cooks in today's food–obsessed climate, while he sticks to the unfussy, straightforward approach that made the original such a hit. Home cooks will learn everything they need for years worth of fabulous meals, from how to decipher recipe measurements, to how to fry an egg, to how to steam a lobster. Even readers weaned on frozen pizza will find recipes they can master, for last minute meals, special occasions and entertaining, and even holidays–all made from scratch with fresh, accessible ingredients. Experienced cooks will appreciate the simple elegance of such flavorful dishes as Veal Scallopini or Pears Poached in Red Wine. Written with Sokolov's trademark wit and wisdom, How To Cook is an invaluable kitchen classic you'll turn to again and again.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/15/9780060083915.jpg', 'title_long': 'How to Cook Revised Edition: An Easy and Imaginative Guide for the Beginner', 'edition': 'Revised ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2004-05-04', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Cooking Methods', 'Main Courses & Side Dishes', 'Burgers & Sandwiches', 'Regional & International', 'U.S. Regional', 'Entertaining & Holidays', 'Reference'], 'authors': ['Raymond Sokolov'], 'title': 'How to Cook Revised Edition: An Easy and Imaginative Guide for the Beginner', 'isbn13': '9780060083915', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060083913', 'isbn10': '0060083913'}}
