{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "When Connor Swann, the dissolute son-in-law of renowned and influential Sir Gerald and Dame Caroline Asherton, is found floating in a Thames River lock, the circumstances eerily recall a strangely similar tragedy. Twenty years ago, the Ashertons' young son, Matthew, a musical prodigy, drowned in a swollen stream while in the company of his sister Julia -- Connor Swann's wife.<br/>Police Superintendant Duncan Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James quickly discover that Connor's death was no accident, and that nothing in the Asherton family is as it seems. Connor, though estranged from Julia for more than a year, still lives in her London apartment, where his exploits with women and gambling suggest plenty of motives. The Ashertons are far more attached to Connor than to their own daughter, and these are only the first of the secrets that haunt the suspects. New lies cover older lies, as Kincaid finds himself dangerously drawn to Julia Swann, and Gemma must confront her own troubling feelings for Kincaid.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/58/9780060789558.jpg', 'title_long': 'Leave the Grave Green (Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James Novels)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.84}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-07-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Deborah Crombie'], 'title': 'Leave the Grave Green (Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James Novels)', 'isbn13': '9780060789558', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060789557', 'isbn10': '0060789557'}}
