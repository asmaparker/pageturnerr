{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTeen', 'synopsis': "Matisse Osgood is a New York City girl through and through. She buys her clothes at Andy's Cheapies, watches indie films at the Angelika, and wouldn't be caught dead on a hayride. But when her father gets sick and Matisse's parents decide to leave Man-hattan for a small town in upstate New York, her perfect world crumbles. As Matisse trudges through life in Prague, she dreams of waking up in her apartment on West 78th Street with a father who's well enough to walk with her in Central Park and a mother who doesn't pretend that everything is okay. When rumors surround Matisse at school and her father's symptoms worsen, Matisse realizes that the friends she's making in Prague are the kind you can count on. They help Matisse find the strength to reach out to her father, who may not be as far from her as she thought. And one particular farm boy shows Matisse that country living is a lot more magical than she ever imagined.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/07/9780061256707.jpg', 'title_long': 'Alive and Well in Prague, New York', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 247, 'date_published': '2008-06-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors': ['Daphne Grab'], 'title': 'Alive and Well in Prague, New York', 'isbn13': '9780061256707', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061256706', 'isbn10': '0061256706'}}
