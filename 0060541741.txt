{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "One of Daphne Wade's guilty pleasures is to watch the Duke of Tremore as he works, shirtless, on the excavation site of his ducal estate. Anthony Courtland is by far the most exciting and handsome man she has ever known, and she dreams of one day being able to speak with him without getting tongue tied.<br/>Anthony, meanwhile, only sees Daphne as a hard worker on his excavation team. He considers her a plain young lady and says so in a careless remark to a friend, unaware that Daphne is outside the library door, her heart shattering to pieces. So Daphne decides she will not be so silly any longer. She begins to be tutored in the social graces, forcing Anthony to see the beauty who has been right in front of his eyes.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/43/9780060541743.jpg', 'title_long': 'Guilty Pleasures (Guilty Series, 1)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Laura Lee Guhrke'], 'title': 'Guilty Pleasures (Guilty Series, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780060541743', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061734527'}, 'isbn': '0060541741', 'isbn10': '0060541741', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061734526', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
