{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "There comes a time in every woman's life when she must get herself a man or give up the idea entirely...<br/>After three long years of patiently waiting for her reluctant, handsome, gentlemanly Amos Dewey, to pop the question, Augusta Mudd--owner of her small town's biggest factory--decides it's time to take matters in her own hands. With the help of her friend, ruggedly attractive Rome Akers, she's determined to make Amos jealous--and get him to the altar--before it's too late.<br/>Rome Akers wasn't ready to settle down. But by pretending to make Augusta his partner for life he had a chance to become her business partner instead. Yet despite his best intentions, the closer he gets to this intelligent, sweet woman, the stronger his feelings grow. Their tantalizing conversations and tender kisses ignite a desire more passionate than Roman ever imagined. Soon he'll do anything to make Augusta a bride--but only if he gets to be the groom.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/69/9780061013669.jpg', 'title_long': 'Here Comes the Bride', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.88 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4188782978 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4188782978}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.88}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2000-07-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Pamela Morsi'], 'title': 'Here Comes the Bride', 'isbn13': '9780061013669', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0062234617'}, 'isbn': '0061013668', 'isbn10': '0061013668', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062234612', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
