{'book': {'publisher': 'Springer', 'synopsis': 'Reengineering, in the context of this book, involves the redesign or transformation of existing Information Systems, while at the same time retaining as much of the original existing system as possible. This approach has obvious benefits when it involves systems that can be automated and/or supported by methods and tools. This book focuses on the practical approaches to Information Systems Reengineering. The two crucial technological areas covered include (1) the conversion of hierarchical or network database systems into relational database technology, or from relational to object-oriented databases, and (2) the integration of database systems and expert systems to produce management information systems (MIS) and executive information systems (EIS), where the concepts, the approach to be taken, and the benefits gained are summarized. The authors describe in detail database conversion techniques, reverse and forward engineering, and a reengineering methodology for information systems.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/58/9789813083158.jpg', 'title_long': 'Information Systems Reengineering', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.000625 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.000625}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 250, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Mathematics'], 'authors': ['shi-ming-huang-joseph-s-p-fong'], 'title': 'Information Systems Reengineering', 'isbn13': '9789813083158', 'msrp': 74.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9813083158', 'isbn10': '9813083158'}}
