Her sister city, St Petersburg, is surely one of the most graceful and well-proportioned cities in the world. Filled with baroque and classical architecture, intersected by canals, it is easy to see how St Petersburg became the inspiration for musicians, artists and writers. This book contains a wealth of information on the two cities and the regions surrounding them. As well as fully updated histories of the cities, this guide includes information on accommodation, shops of every kind and restaurants for any budget. Also included is an indispensable guide to the Golden Ring, a series of ancient Russian towns set in the stunning countryside around Moscow.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/19/9789622176119.jpg', 'title_long': 'Moscow & St. Petersburg', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 2.00841120682 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.00841120682}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 592, 'date_published': '1999-04-01', 'subjects': ['Travel', 'Asia', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'General'], 'authors': ['Masha Nordbye'], 'title': 'Moscow & St. Petersburg', 'isbn13': '9789622176119', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9622176119', 'isbn10': '9622176119'}}
