{'book': {'publisher': 'R & S Books', 'synopsis': "From School Library Journal      Grade 2-3-- Three Swedish children, plus assorted pets, tour the solar system in a wooden spaceship. Between the front endpapers, on which asteroids are defined as ``hundreds of small planets'' (try ``thousands''), and the final painting of the Milky Way Galaxy, in which there is no discernible spiral, the author has assembled an up-to-date but perfunctory scattering of facts imbedded in a vanishingly thin plot. The production is slipshod too: the original labels are imperfectly erased from a map of the Moon, one page of text is printed in smaller type than the rest, there is a typo in the one-item bibliography--and surely the translator could have chosen a more familiar (not to mention palatable) simile than a ``. . . bowl of blueberry soup with dabs of whipped cream on it'' to describe the Earth from space. Young astronauts will find Cole's Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System (Scholastic, 1990) a far more rewarding ride.- John Peters, New York Public LibraryCopyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.
