Mariette answers these questions and more with sage advice and an easy-to-follow, step-by-step approach. She shares the experience of renovating her own homes -- one, a house in the country, the other, an apartment in the city -- and the many homes around the country that bear her unique signature.<br/>Whether you are decorating a loft apartment, summer cottage, or home in the suburbs, Rooms will help you strike the balance between beautiful and practical, lavish and livable.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/00/9780060083700.jpg', 'title_long': 'Rooms: Creating Luxurious, Livable Spaces (Design)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.32 Inches, Length: 8.32 Inches, Weight: 2.55 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.32}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.32}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2003-07-08', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Architecture', 'Interior Design', 'Decorative Arts & Design', 'Interior & Home Design', 'Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Crafts & Hobbies', 'Decorating', 'Home Improvement & Design', 'Decorating & Design'], 'authors': ['Mariette Himes Gomez'], 'title': 'Rooms: Creating Luxurious, Livable Spaces (Design)', 'isbn13': '9780060083700', 'msrp': 35.23, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060083700', 'isbn10': '0060083700'}}
