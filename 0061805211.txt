{'book': {'publisher': 'Dey Street Books', 'synopsis': 'Why settle down when you can hook up? "Happily married people and perpetually single people are similar: We\'ve both given up on dating and have merely chosen different exit strategies." So begins Aaron Karo\'s hilarious exploration of bachelor life, from the alcohol-fueled pursuit of chicks in bars to sophisticated advances on defenseless bridesmaids. As his thirtieth birthday approaches, Karo observes the women around him growing increasingly desperate to tie the knot and finds himself equally determinedâ€”to remain uncommitted. What follows is an outrageous account of one man\'s quest to party like a rock star, get laid with abandon, and silence his critics in relationships with the rebuke "I\'m having more fun than you." Irreverent, insightful, and relentlessly funny, Karo offers a unique glimpse into the world of guys who defy convention, morality, and their moms in order to preserve their independence.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/19/9780061805219.jpg', 'title_long': "I'm Having More Fun Than You", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.58}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2009-09-15', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Culinary', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Cooking', 'Love, Sex & Marriage', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Theories of Humor', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Genres & Styles', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Customs & Traditions', 'Human Sexuality'], 'authors': ['Aaron Karo'], 'title': "I'm Having More Fun Than You", 'isbn13': '9780061805219', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061959596'}, 'isbn': '0061805211', 'isbn10': '0061805211', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061959592', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
