{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'It is a call no supervisor wants to hear -- a late-night summons that pulls Sergeant Eddie North to the dark, deserted streets of West Philadelphia. A powerful African American city councilman has been savagely beaten, and he\'s accusing two Philly policemen of the assault. Suddenly a good cop is plunged into the center of a media circus fueled by rage, mistrust, and blind hatred, further straining relations between the police and the black community. But finding the truth in a mountain of lies may prove impossible -- even fatal -- for Eddie North, forcing him to cross the line to do what he feels is right. Because a cop killer is emerging from the shadows to wreak a terrible vengeance as the battle heats up between a community and its "protectors." And in the end, only the strongest -- and the luckiest -- will survive.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/00/9780061031700.jpg', 'title_long': 'Four to Midnight: A Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.39}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2004-05-25', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery'], 'authors': ['Scott Flander'], 'title': 'Four to Midnight: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780061031700', 'msrp': 7.5, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061850055'}, 'isbn': '0061031704', 'isbn10': '0061031704', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061850059', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
