{'book': {'publisher': 'WilliamMr', 'synopsis': "Just when we really need it, a scathingly funny novel that skewers the ego-driven, morally bankrupt world of The Big Deal<br/>Billionaire Robert Maxx is a king in the world of real estate. Prestigious buildings bear his name, the press treats him like royalty, and beautiful women are thrilled to be seen on his arm. Ruthless, bullying, vengeful, and yet, at times, improbably endearing, Maxx both repels and fascinates.<br/>For writer David Collins, things are not so rosy. His novels didn't sell. His marriage fell apart. Scrabbling for a livelihood, he's turned to ghostwriting. When he gets the gig to crank out Maxx's next bestseller, he regards the assignment as nothing more than an easy payday.<br/>But something happens. The storyteller in Collins takes over, and he realizes that this isn't one more hack job. It may be his last chance to write something of real value, reclaim his battered self-respect, and win back the ex-wife he still loves.<br/>Against the all-too-real background of a cratering economy and the end of easy money, things start to fall apart for Maxx. As it becomes clear that his mighty empire was built on lies, hucksterism, and dubious accounting, the stage is set for deadly conflict between a fallen idol desperate to conceal the truth and a writer obsessed with an inside story that only he can tell.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/90/9780061456190.jpg', 'title_long': 'Maxxed Out', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 310, 'date_published': '2009-04-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['David Collins'], 'title': 'Maxxed Out', 'isbn13': '9780061456190', 'msrp': 24.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061456195', 'isbn10': '0061456195'}}
