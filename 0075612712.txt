{'book': {'publisher': 'Richard D Irwin', 'synopsis': 'This text explores corporate finance for undergraduate students. The text is compatible with "Corporate Finance" fourth edition, but is designed for those students who may find it too rigorous. It provides coverage of the time value of money, and learning aids include chapter-opening vignettes from real-world business events, small business examples are integrated throughout and end-of-chapter material reviews concepts and poses critical thinking questions. Principles are separated and explained on a common-sense level before specifics are addressed. The text adopts a unified valuation approach, treating net present value as the basic concept underlying corporate finance and it has a strong managerial focus, placing emphasis on the role of the financial manager as a decision maker.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/11/9780075612711.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fundamentals of Corporate Finance (Irwin/Mcgraw-Hill Series in Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate.)', 'edition': '4th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 1.25 Inches, Width: 8.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.5}}, 'pages': 708, 'date_published': '1998', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership'], 'authors': ['Stephen A.
