{'book': {'publisher': 'Pearson', 'synopsis': 'Offers an authoritative perspective on both theory and practice: the authors are world renowned scientists and engineers with academic and practical experience in environmental matters. Focused on current environmental problems, their causes, effects, and solutions, this book explores the basic nature of the natural systems. Using a technical (quantitative) approach — it maintains a broad perspective that appeals to all, but at the same time is useful to those proceeding further in environmental or sanitary engineering. In addition to the traditional topics of water quality, wastewater treatment, and air pollution, it explains the root causes of environmental problems and clarifies the relationships between natural systems and technology. Provides discussions on solid and hazardous wastes, environmental management, and ethics — topics seldom found in a single text. Discusses the changing role of technology — e.g., “preventive technology” as an alternative to traditional “end-of-pipe” solutions. Considers recent data on the causes of environmental problems — e.g., population and economic growth, energy growth, natural environmental hazards, and environmental disturbances. Expands coverage of such topics as water consumption and drinking water standards; water pollution; scientific background — e.g., atmospheric sciences, Cryptosporidium.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/02/9780131206502.jpg', 'title_long': 'Environmental Science and Engineering', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.1 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.220462262 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.220462262}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.1}}, 'pages': 800, 'date_published': '1996-03-21', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Civil & Environmental', 'Science & Math', 'Earth Sciences', 'Environmental Science', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['J.
