{'book': {'publisher': 'South-Western College Pub', 'synopsis': "Most finance students will do short-term finance assignments when they go to work. In recent survey of CEO's, Controllers, and Treasurers that appeared in Financial Practice & Education, the question was asked which elective is the most important and 81% responded a short-term financial management course should be required. Both authors hold a Certified Cash Manager credential. Strengths include broader and better integrated coverage of treasury and working capital management, while using valuation and the cash flow timeline as integrating themes. Up to date presentations of developments in treasury management, banking deregulation, globalization of financial services delivery, electronic commerce, international cash management, and foreign exchange risk with a decision making emphasis throughout offers a complete view for students. This text is appropriate for upper level undergraduate finance courses in short-term financial management, working capital management, treasury management, and cash and cash flow management. It can also fit the MBA level financial management and short-term financial management courses.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/38/9780030315138.jpg', 'title_long': 'Short-Term Financial Management', 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 3.2 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 696, 'date_published': '2001-09-10', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Finance', 'Investing', 'Management & Leadership', 'Management', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Terry S.
