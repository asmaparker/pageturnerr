{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "For most people, Hawaii is heaven on Earth. But U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Rachel Porter sees the rot beneath its natural splendor. Its pristine shores are harboring a new breed of criminal, those who would upset the fragile ecological balance in the name of profit ... those who would kill in the cause of greed.<br/>On the trail of illegal traffickers in exotic animals, Rachel stumbles upon something far more insidious and frightening -- and a suspiciously shark-devoured human corpse that washes up on the rocks is only the beginning. Suddenly everyone wants her off a case that is too hot to handle. But she won't be warned, coaxed, or threatened away, even as the blood that darkens the tropical waters marks Rachel Porter as the most endangered creature in Paradise.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/57/9780060559557.jpg', 'title_long': 'Restless Waters: A Rachel Porter Mystery', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2005-07-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jessica Speart'], 'title': 'Restless Waters: A Rachel Porter Mystery', 'isbn13': '9780060559557', 'msrp': 27.86, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060559551', 'isbn10': '0060559551'}}
