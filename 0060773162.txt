{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Dear Friend,<br/>You were right: desperation is a dangerous state of mind. It was desperation that drove me to London to salvage my family's reputation and finances in the first place. And it is desperation—and perhaps a little desire—that has gotten me into the situation I find myself in now.<br/>You see, I've become ensnared in the investigation of a traitor by Lord Dewhurst—the most insufferable, sinfully handsome man I've ever met. I know it is shocking, but in order to catch this spy and clear my name, I've no choice but to play the agent's bride. Now I'm desperate again to avoid his seductive words and searing looks. I pray that I can resist him, but I can make no promises. Oh, my dear friend, I know he and I are merely pretending to be wed, but the blush he can send all the way to my petticoats feels far too real!<br/>Yours truly,<br/>Charlotte", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/68/9780060773168.jpg', 'title_long': 'Pride and Petticoats (Regency Spies)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006-01-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Shana Galen'], 'title': 'Pride and Petticoats (Regency Spies)', 'isbn13': '9780060773168', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061750352'}, 'isbn': '0060773162', 'isbn10': '0060773162', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061750359', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
