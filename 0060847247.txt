The police have no clues. They fear he is dead, but Ellie knows better. She also knows that she is the only one who can find him.<br/>At the same time, in the world Danny and Ellie imagined, a young girl named Argent sets off on a quest of her own to reclaim a stolen dragon hatchling.<br/>As each girl makes her way closer to her goal, the boundaries between the worlds of fantasy and reality begin to blur until it's unclear where one world ends and the other begins.
