{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': 'Over the past decade, the stakes in youth sports have reached startling heights; the pressure to win often eclipses the desire to have fun. Sports injuries have increased tenfold; aggression on and off the field—between kids, parents, and coaches—is at a fever pitch; and drug and alcohol use among young athletes is on the rise. While there are plenty of books that help the best-intentioned parent, most of them are written by men, for men. They do not address concerns specific to mothers, nor empower them to confidently step onto the out-of-control playground to assume whatever role they choose—spectator, advocate, administrator, coach, fund-raiser, or team mom.<br/>Home Team Advantage is an essential resource manual that will inspire women to confidently tackle some of the issues preventing their kids from enjoying sports. Brooke de Lench authoritatively covers issues ranging from ensuring playing time and confronting out-of-control coaches to countering the "winning at all costs" mentality. Packed with real-life anecdotes and information from experts, Home Team Advantage provides constructive, practical, and forward-thinking advice to help mothers understand the critical role they can play in putting the words fun, game, and play back into youth sports.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/34/9780060881634.jpg', 'title_long': 'Home Team Advantage: The Critical Role of Mothers in Youth Sports', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.12 Inches, Length: 7.38 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.38}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.12}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2006-09-05', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Child Psychology', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Early Childhood', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Soccer', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology'], 'authors': ['Brooke de Lench'], 'title': 'Home Team Advantage: The Critical Role of Mothers in Youth Sports', 'isbn13': '9780060881634', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061746886'}, 'isbn': '0060881631', 'isbn10': '0060881631', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061746888', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
