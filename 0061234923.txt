{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Beautiful Grace Paget has no reason not to believe these words. After all, she was kidnapped, spirited away to a remote country manor, and told she is to grant this man his every desire . . . or lose her life. But Grace is no common trollop. So she risks everything to save her virtue by planning a daring escape, even though she finds herself tempted by this handsome man. There is something in his eyes that makes her wonder if he is as dangerous as he would have her believe.<br/>Sheene knew nothing of the plan to bring him this woman. Locked up as a prisoner, called "mad" by all of the world, he will do anything to reclaim his life, and Grace\'s sensuous beauty has distracted him from his goals. And although he finds her irresistible, he is horrified to hold her against her will. Now, together, they must both revolt against the strange set of circumstances that have forced them togetherâ€”for only then will Grace truly surrender to him . . . forever.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/27/9780061234927.jpg', 'title_long': 'Untouched', 'edition': 'First Avon Books Paperback Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2007-11-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Anna Campbell'], 'title': 'Untouched', 'isbn13': '9780061234927', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061234923', 'isbn10': '0061234923', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061802027', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
