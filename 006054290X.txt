{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'A Middle Eastern potentate and his entourage are descending on Martha\'s Vineyard -- and chaos is in the salt air. Ex-Boston-cop Jeff "J.W." Jackson would rather be fishing with his lady Zee, but the island\'s overtaxed police force needs his help to control the madness their visitor\'s arrival has stirred up -- especially since the great man will not leave before ceremoniously reclaiming an emerald necklace stolen from his nation a century ago. But when both the jewels and Zee vanish, J.W. is quickly transformed from rent-a-cop to frantic investigator. Because an ill tide has carried desperate men to this idyllic island with murder on their minds. And Jackson suddenly stands to lose everything that he dearly loves.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/00/9780060542900.jpg', 'title_long': "Vineyard Deceit: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery (A Martha's Vineyard Mystery, 3)", 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.28 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.28}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2003-07-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Cozy', 'Private Investigators', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Philip R Craig'], 'title': "Vineyard Deceit: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery (A Martha's Vineyard Mystery, 3)", 'isbn13': '9780060542900', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '006054290X', 'isbn10': '006054290X'}}
