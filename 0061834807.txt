{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': '"[An] ambitious economic history of the united States...rich with details." ?—David Leonhardt, New York Times Book Review<br/>How did a weak collection of former British colonies become an industrial, financial, and military colossus?<br/>From the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries, the American economy has been transformed by wave after wave of emerging technology: the steam engine, electricity, the internal combustion engine, computer technology. Yet technology-driven change leads to growing misalignment between an innovative economy and anachronistic legal and political structures until the gap is closed by the modernization of America\'s institutions—often amid upheavals such as the Civil War and Reconstruction and the Great Depression and World War II.<br/>When the U.S. economy has flourished, government and business, labor and universities, have worked together in a never-ending project of economic nation building. As the United States struggles to emerge from the Great Recession, Michael Lind clearly demonstrates that Americans, since the earliest days of the republic, have reinvented the American economy - and have the power to do so again.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/06/9780061834806.jpg', 'title_long': 'Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States', 'edition': 'First Edition - First Printing.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.87 Pounds, Width: 1.43 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.43}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.87}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 592, 'date_published': '2012-04-17', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic Conditions', 'Economic History', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources'], 'authors': ['Michael Lind'], 'title': 'Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States', 'isbn13': '9780061834806', 'msrp': 29.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061834807', 'isbn10': '0061834807'}}
