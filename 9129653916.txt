But as it happened, the rabbit's mommy and daddy both went off to work every day, so he had to go to day care. Then a new rabbit teacher arrived. She had unusually long ears -- and she was especially nice -- and every morning the rabbit got to sit on her lap. One day when he had sat there for a while, he realized he wanted to get down and play. Soon he was no longer hiding under the bed when it was time to leave in the morning!<br/><br/>Any child facing the challenge of going off to day care or school for the first time will immediately identify with the reluctant hero of this gentle tale. Warm, glowing pictures bring the everyday details of day care and school alive.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/15/9789129653915.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Rabbit Who Longed For Home (English and Swedish Edition)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 28, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Rabbits'], 'authors': ['Lilian Edvall', 'Anna-Clara Tidholm', 'Elisabeth Kallick Dyssegaard'], 'title': 'The Rabbit Who Longed For Home (English and Swedish Edition)', 'isbn13': '9789129653915', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'School & Library Binding', 'isbn': '9129653916', 'isbn10': '9129653916'}}
