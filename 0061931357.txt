{'book': {'publisher': 'Igniter', 'synopsis': "The outrageous, yet surprisingly moving, memoir of a girl who fled the Iranian Revolution—and found her salvation in the deliriously sexy life of a rock-'n'-roll groupie.<br/>Honest, provocative, and vividly written, The Last Living Slut is the memoir of Roxana Shirazi, who was raised traditionally in Tehran. After her family spirits her to the West in flight from the Iranian Revolution, Shirazi is led far astray by the sound—and the sex appeal—of rock and roll. Caught between her sexual appetites, passion for music (and musicians), and fear of being a bad seed, Shirazi bares her soul to offer a raw account of her life as an eager-to-please rock groupie. With appearances by members of Guns N' Roses, Mötley Crüe, Velvet Revolver, and many more, The Last Living Slut is a moving memoir of growing up in the political turbulence of Tehran; an unflinching portrayal of teenage cultural dislocation in London; a backstage romp that makes Pamela Des Barres's I'm with the Band read like a nun's diary; and a white-knuckled tale of jilted love and brutal revenge.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/52/9780061931352.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Last Living Slut: Born in Iran, Bred Backstage', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 0.88 Inches, Weight: 1.32 Pounds, Width: 5.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.88}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.32}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2010-06-01', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Composers & Musicians', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Individual Sports', 'Horses', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Roxana Shirazi'], 'title': 'The Last Living Slut: Born in Iran, Bred Backstage', 'isbn13': '9780061931352', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061931357', 'isbn10': '0061931357'}}
