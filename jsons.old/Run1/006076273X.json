{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperAudio', 'synopsis': "In one of the most acclaimed novels in recent memory, Edward P. Jones, two-time National Book Award finalist, tells the story of Henry Townsend, a black farmer and former slave who falls under the tutelage of William Robbins, the most powerful man in Manchester County, Virginia. Making certain he never circumvents the law, Townsend runs his affairs with unusual discipline. But when death takes him unexpectedly, his widow, Caldonia, can't uphold the estate's order and chaos ensues. In a daring and ambitious novel, Jones has woven a footnote of history into an epic that takes an unflinching look at slavery in all of its moral complexities.<br/>Performed by Kevin Free", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/35/9780060762735.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Known World CD', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.5 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}}, 'pages': 14, 'date_published': '2004-06-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies'], 'authors': ['Edward P.
