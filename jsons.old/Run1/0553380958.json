{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House Worlds', 'synopsis': 'The “brilliantly realized” (The New York Times Book Review) breakthrough novel from visionary author Neal Stephenson, a modern classic that predicted the metaverse and inspired generations of Silicon Valley innovators<br/><br/>Hiro lives in a Los Angeles where franchises line the freeway as far as the eye can see. The only relief from the sea of logos is within the autonomous city-states, where law-abiding citizens don’t dare leave their mansions.<br/><br/>Hiro delivers pizza to the mansions for a living, defending his pies from marauders when necessary with a matched set of samurai swords. His home is a shared 20 X 30 U-Stor-It. He spends most of his time goggled in to the Metaverse, where his avatar is legendary.<br/><br/>But in the club known as The Black Sun, his fellow hackers are being felled by a weird new drug called Snow Crash that reduces them to nothing more than a jittering cloud of bad digital karma (and IRL, a vegetative state).<br/><br/>Investigating the Infocalypse leads Hiro all the way back to the beginning of language itself, with roots in an ancient Sumerian priesthood. He’ll be joined by Y.T., a fearless teenaged skateboard courier. Together, they must race to stop a shadowy virtual villain hell-bent on world domination.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/58/9780553380958.jpg', 'title_long': 'Snow Crash', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.46 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.32 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.46}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.32}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2}}, 'pages': 440, 'date_published': '2000', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Computers & Internet', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Humorous'], 'authors': ['Neal Stephenson'], 'title': 'Snow Crash', 'isbn13': '9780553380958', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0553898191'}, 'isbn': '0553380958', 'isbn10': '0553380958', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780553898194', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
