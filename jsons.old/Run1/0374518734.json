The structure of the book never changed, but its breadth caused him to complete it in stages, under the overall title Annals of the Former World.<br/><br/>Like the terrain it covers, Annals of the Former World tells a multilayered tale, and the reader may choose one of many paths through it. As clearly and succinctly written as it is profoundly informed, this is our finest popular survey of geology and a masterpiece of modern nonfiction.<br/><br/>Annals of the Former World is the winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/38/9780374518738.jpg', 'title_long': 'Annals of the Former World', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.0499879 Inches, Weight: 1.94 Pounds, Width: 1.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.0499879}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.94}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 720, 'date_published': '2000-06-15', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Science & Math', 'Earth Sciences', 'Geology'], 'authors': ['John McPhee'], 'title': 'Annals of the Former World', 'isbn13': '9780374518738', 'msrp': 15.77, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0374518734', 'isbn10': '0374518734'}}
