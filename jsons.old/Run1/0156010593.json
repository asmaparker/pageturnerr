But one day, when he comes across the records of an anonymous young woman, something happens to him. Obsessed, Senhor José sets off to follow the thread that may lead him to the woman—but as he gets closer, he discovers more about her, and about himself, than he would ever have wished.The loneliness of people's lives, the effects of chance, the discovery of love—all coalesce in this extraordinary novel that displays the power and art of José Saramago in brilliant form.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/97/9780156010597.jpg', 'title_long': 'All The Names', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.001212542441 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.62}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.001212542441}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2001-10-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Death', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['José Saramago'], 'title': 'All The Names', 'isbn13': '9780156010597', 'msrp': 10.22, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0156010593', 'isbn10': '0156010593', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547536859', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
