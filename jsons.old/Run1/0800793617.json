His love and power have no limits-and that\'s a message readers from all walks of life need to hear. The modern miracles that Rolland and Heidi Baker experience every day in their work with Mozambique\'s throwaway children, movingly chronicled in Always Enough, will inspire anyone looking for hope in the midst of suffering.<br/>The Bakers, formerly missionaries in Indonesia and Hong Kong, share how their work for the past eight years in Mozambique, one of the poorest nations on earth, has borne spiritual fruit beyond their wildest dreams. Every day presents multiple impossible needs. But in the face of everything Satan can do, as Rolland and Heidi lay down their lives and "minister to the one," there is always enough.<br/>Readers will discover that the simple practice of choosing to step out and trust God every day unleashes his provision for every need.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/16/9780800793616.jpg', 'title_long': "Always Enough: God's Miraculous Provision among the Poorest Children on Earth", 'edition': 'Reprinted', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.62 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.44}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.62}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2003-09', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Social Issues', 'Ministry & Evangelism', 'Missions & Missionary Work', 'Evangelism', 'Protestantism', 'Pentecostal & Charismatic', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Rolland Baker', 'Heidi Baker'], 'title': "Always Enough: God's Miraculous Provision among the Poorest Children on Earth", 'isbn13': '9780800793616', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1441233377'}, 'isbn': '0800793617', 'isbn10': '0800793617', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781441233370', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
