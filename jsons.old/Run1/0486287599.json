{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': 'The originality, concentrated power and "fierce indignation" of his satirical writing have earned Jonathan Swift (1667â€“1745) a reputation as the greatest prose satirist in English language.<br/>Gulliver\'s Travels is, of course, his world-renowned masterpiece in the genre; however, Swift wrote other, shorter works that also offer excellent evidence of his inspired lampoonery. Perhaps the most famous of these is "A Modest Proposal," in which he straight-facedly suggests that Ireland could solve its hunger problems by using its children for food. Also included in this collection are "The Battle of the Books," "A Meditation upon a Broomstick," "A Discourse Concerning the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit," and "An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity in England." This inexpensive edition will certainly be welcomed by teachers and students of English literature, but its appeal extends to any reader who delights in watching a master satirist wield words as weapons.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/91/9780486287591.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Modest Proposal and Other Satirical Works (Dover Thrift Editions)', 'edition': 'Special Value', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.26 Inches, Length: 5.2 inches, Weight: 0.1212542441 Pounds, Width: 0.16 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.16}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.1212542441}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.26}}, 'pages': 64, 'date_published': '1996-02-02', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'European', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government'], 'authors': ['Jonathan Swift'], 'title': 'A Modest Proposal and Other Satirical Works (Dover Thrift Editions)', 'isbn13': '9780486287591', 'msrp': 3, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0486110753'}, 'isbn': '0486287599', 'isbn10': '0486287599', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486110752', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
