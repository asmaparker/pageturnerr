Having demystified the equation, Bodanis explains its science and brings it to life historically, making clear the astonishing array of discoveries and consequences it made possible. It would prove to be a beacon throughout the twentieth century, important to Ernest Rutherford, who discovered the structure of the atom, Enrico Fermi, who probed the nucleus, and Lise Meitner, who finally understood how atoms could be split wide open. And it has come to inform our daily lives, governing everything from the atomic bomb to a television\'s cathode-ray tube to the carbon dating of prehistoric paintings.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/45/9780425181645.jpg', 'title_long': "E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 4.8 Inches, Weight: 0.61 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.61}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4}}, 'pages': 337, 'date_published': '2001-10-01', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'History & Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'History', 'Physics', 'Applied', 'Quantum Theory', 'Relativity', 'Technology', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['David Bodanis'], 'title': "E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation", 'isbn13': '9780425181645', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0425181642', 'isbn10': '0425181642'}}
