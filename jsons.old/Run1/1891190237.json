{'book': {'publisher': 'Atelos', 'synopsis': "Poetry. African American Studies. Ed Roberson might no longer live in Pittsburgh, but the city in which he was born and raised still leaves its fragmented structures etched throughout his poetry. A city of hard work and hard times, the now-impoverished neighborhoods that had at one time stood as centers of jazz and art; the hills, the rivers, the skyscraping iron and steel, and the pain. Though most of the poems in this collection do not necessarily take place in Pittsburgh, there is a rhythmic fragmentation here painting portraits of urban life in general. Beauty, music, poverty, blood, and concrete seem to live within the line breaks, while breath-stopping pauses halt you just long enough so that--like at a smoky backroom jazz club--you can't wait to see what he does next.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/30/9781891190230.jpg', 'title_long': 'City Eclogue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 136, 'date_published': '2006-01-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies'], 'authors': ['Ed Roberson'], 'title': 'City Eclogue', 'isbn13': '9781891190230', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1891190237', 'isbn10': '1891190237'}}
