{'book': {'publisher': 'Union Square Kids', 'synopsis': 'The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch & Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br/><br/>Scott created these drawings in scratchboard an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.<br/><br/>Sneaky pirates, sailing ships, buried treasure, exotic lands, and murderous mutiny: what could be better to win over even the most reluctant boy reader? Robert Louis Stevenson serves up thrills, chills, and plenty of action in this timeless, and much-admired adventure novel.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/73/9781402714573.jpg', 'title_long': 'Treasure Island (Union Square Kids Unabridged Classics)', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.13978989454 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.13978989454}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 232, 'date_published': '2004-10-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Sea Stories', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Robert Louis Stevenson'], 'title': 'Treasure Island (Union Square Kids Unabridged Classics)', 'isbn13': '9781402714573', 'msrp': 9.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1402714572', 'isbn10': '1402714572', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781402792731', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
