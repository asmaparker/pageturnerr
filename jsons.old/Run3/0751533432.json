{'book': {'publisher': 'Sphere', 'synopsis': "Edwardian England is a country at the peak of its power; a kingdom of peace, prosperity and progress. As Jessie and Violet enjoy their coming-out in the glittering Season of 1908, their thoughts are of pleasure, dancing and falling in love.<br/><br/>For the Morlands things seem set fair: new business ventures expand their influence and wealth; there are weddings, babies in the nursery, careers for the boys now reaching manhood. It is an exciting age, with new technologies - motor cars, telephones, radio, aeroplanes - extending man's control over the natural world.<br/><br/>But under the appearance of permanence, a different reality is stirring. Socialism, the suffrage movement, the constitutional crisis, all call forth ever more dissent and anger. Increasingly violent protests and strikes disturb the peace; war with Germany looms ever closer. With the King's death, it begins to seem that the safe Edwardian world was only a dream, from which the wakening will be hard indeed.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/39/9780751533439.jpg', 'title_long': 'Morland Dynasty 26: The Dream Kingdom', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.8377565956 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8377565956}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 640, 'date_published': '2004-11-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Cynthia Harrod-Eagles'], 'title': 'Morland Dynasty 26: The Dream Kingdom', 'isbn13': '9780751533439', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0748133135'}, 'isbn': '0751533432', 'isbn10': '0751533432', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780748133130', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
