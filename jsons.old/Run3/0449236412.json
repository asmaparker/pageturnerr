{'book': {'publisher': 'Fawcett Crest', 'synopsis': 'In the mid-1940s, the great historical novelist Anya Seton embarked on a fervent search for her forebears that led her to Marblehead, Massachusetts, a sea-girdled town of rocks and winding lanes and clustered old houses.‚Äù There she found not only an ancestor, but also the setting for this, her fourth novel. It is not only the story of Marblehead, from its earliest settlement to the present, and of a family who settled and stayed there in the Hearth and Eagle Inn; it is also the story of Hesper Honeywood, a passionate young woman whose long and dramatic life, full of triumph and tragedy, contained the history of both. In one of her most ambitious novels, Anya Seton here created one of her most memorable heroines, and one of her most varied tales.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/13/9780449236413.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Hearth & Eagle.[Marblehead,MA,from its earliest settlement to the present].', 'edition': '(1st,1948); 1st thus', 'date_published': '1980', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Anya Seton'], 'title': 'The Hearth & Eagle.[Marblehead,MA,from its earliest settlement to the present].', 'isbn13': '9780449236413', 'msrp': 2.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0449236412', 'isbn10': '0449236412'}}
