{'book': {'publisher': 'Bristol Classical Press', 'synopsis': "Iphigenia at Aulis is one of Euripides' most intriguing and challenging plays. It dramatises the myth of Iphigenia, the young virgin sacrificed by her father Agamemnon at the start of the expedition against Troy. Produced at the end of the Peloponnesian war, it explores the breakdown of social norms which turns Greeks against Greeks, men against women, and condemns young brides to death. Pantelis Michelakis examines the mythological, sociopolitical and institutional background, as well as the cultural, political, institutional, and theatrical contexts within which it was originally composed and performed.He highlights the main themes and major issues in modern criticism, and ends with an outline of its performance history and reception.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/49/9780715629949.jpg', 'title_long': 'Euripides: Iphigenia at Aulis (Companions to Greek and Roman Tragedy)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2006-03-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Ancient & Classical', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Genres & Styles', 'Ancient & Medieval Literature', 'Greek', 'Roman', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Instruction', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing'], 'authors': ['Pantelis Michelakis'], 'title': 'Euripides: Iphigenia at Aulis (Companions to Greek and Roman Tragedy)', 'isbn13': '9780715629949', 'msrp': 24, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0715629948', 'isbn10': '0715629948'}}
