{'book': {'publisher': 'Atlantic Monthly Press', 'synopsis': 'Cold Mountain is an extraordinary novel about a soldier’s perilous journey back to his beloved at the end of the Civil War. At once a magnificent love story and a harrowing account of one man’s long walk home, Cold Mountain introduces a stunning new talent in American literature.<br/><br/>Based on local history and family stories passed down by the author’s great-great-grandfather, Cold Mountain is the tale of a wounded soldier, Inman, who walks away from the ravages of the war and back home to his prewar sweetheart, Ada. Inman’s odyssey through the devastated landscape of the soon-to-be-defeated South interweaves with Ada’s struggle to revive her father’s farm, with the help of an intrepid young drifter named Ruby. As their long-separated lives begin to converge at the close of the war, Inman and Ada confront the vastly transformed world they’ve been delivered.<br/><br/>Charles Frazier reveals marked insight into man’s relationship to the land and the dangers of solitude. He also shares with the great nineteenth century novelists a keen observation of a society undergoing change. Cold Mountain re-creates a world gone by that speaks eloquently to our time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/94/9780871136794.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cold Mountain', 'edition': '1st', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.42418621252 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.42418621252}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 356, 'date_published': '1997-05-16', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'War', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Charles Frazier'], 'title': 'Cold Mountain', 'isbn13': '9780871136794', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0871136791', 'isbn10': '0871136791'}}
