{'book': {'publisher': 'Da Capo Press', 'synopsis': 'Chicago has always had a reputation as a "wide open town" with a high tolerance for gangsters, illegal liquor, and crooked politicians. It has also been the home for countless black musicians and the birthplace of a distinctly urban blues-more sophisticated, cynical, and street-smart than the anguished songs of the Mississippi delta--a music called the Chicago blues. This is the history of that music and the dozens of black artists who congregated on the South and Near West Sides. Muddy Waters, Big Bill Broonzy, Howlin\' Wolf, Elmore James, Tampa Red, Little Walter, Jimmy Reed, Otis Rush, Sonny Boy Williamson, Junior Wells, Eddie Taylor--all of these giants played throughout the city and created a musical style that had imitators and influence all over the world.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/57/9780306801457.jpg', 'title_long': 'Chicago Blues: The City & the Music', 'edition': '5th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.64 Inches, Length: 8.23 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 5.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.23}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59965735264}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.64}}, 'pages': 226, 'date_published': '1981-08-22', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'History & Criticism', 'Musical Genres', 'Theory, Composition & Performance'], 'authors': ['Mike Rowe'], 'title': 'Chicago Blues: The City & the Music', 'isbn13': '9780306801457', 'msrp': 16.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0306801450', 'isbn10': '0306801450'}}
