{'book': {'publisher': 'Anchor', 'synopsis': 'In 1971, a man calling himself D.B. Cooper hijacked a flight, claimed his ransom without harming a soul, and vanished. Elwood Reid uses this true story as a starting point, imagining Cooper as Phil Fitch, a Vietnam vet with a failed marriage who decides the time has come to do something that will save him from a life of punching timecards and wondering what could have been. Fitch ends up in Mexico, where he drifts until a bad turn of luck forces him to return home.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, newly retired FBI agent Frank Marshall is struggling with his new life of leisure–fishing, spending time with family, and drinking too much. Unable to let go of a few old cases, Marshall decides to help a young agent determined to solve the mystery of D. B. Cooper. As they close in and events bring Fitch back home, these two stories head for a moving climax in a smart, gripping, and frequently hilarious tale of one of America’s modern folk heroes.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/98/9780385497398.jpg', 'title_long': 'D.B.: A Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.23}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59965735264}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.97}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2005-07-12', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', "Men's Adventure", 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Romance', "Women's Adventure", 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Elwood Reid'], 'title': 'D.B.: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780385497398', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307275086'}, 'isbn': '0385497393', 'isbn10': '0385497393', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307275080', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
