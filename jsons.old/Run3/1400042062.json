{'book': {'publisher': "Everyman's Library", 'synopsis': 'The brevity of Muriel Spark’s novels is equaled only by their brilliance. These four novels, each a miniature masterpiece, illustrate her development over four decades. Despite the seriousness of their themes, all four are fantastic comedies of manners, bristling with wit.<br/><br/>Spark’s most celebrated novel, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, tells the story of a charismatic schoolteacher’s catastrophic effect on her pupils. The Girls of Slender Means is a beautifully drawn portrait of young women living in a hostel in London in the giddy postwar days of 1945. The Driver’s Seat follows the final haunted hours of a woman descending into madness. And The Only Problem is a witty fable about suffering that brings the Book of Job to bear on contemporary terrorism.<br/><br/>All four novels give evidence of one of the most original and unmistakable voices in contemporary fiction. Characters are vividly etched in a few words; earth-shaking events are lightly touched on. Yet underneath the glittering surface there is an obsessive probing of metaphysical questions: the meaning of good and evil, the need for salvation, the search for significance.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/67/9781400042067.jpg', 'title_long': "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, The Girls of Slender Means, The Driver's Seat, The Only Problem: Introduction by Frank Kermode (Everyman's Library Contemporary Classics Series)", 'edition': '1st THUS', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.31 Inches, Length: 5.27 Inches, Weight: 1.23 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.27}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.13}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.23}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.31}}, 'pages': 504, 'date_published': '2004-04-06', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', "Women's Fiction", 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Muriel Spark'], 'title': "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, The Girls of Slender Means, The Driver's Seat, The Only Problem: Introduction by Frank Kermode (Everyman's Library Contemporary Classics Series)", 'isbn13': '9781400042067', 'msrp': 16.44, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1400042062', 'isbn10': '1400042062'}}
