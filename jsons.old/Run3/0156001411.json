{'book': {'publisher': 'Mariner Books', 'synopsis': 'A wry, fictional account of the life of Christ by the Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, “Illuminated by ferocious wit, gentle passion, and poetry” (Los Angeles Times Book Review). For José Saramago, the life of Jesus Christ and the story of his Passion were things of this earth: a child crying, a gust of wind, the caress of a woman half asleep, the bleat of a goat or the bark of a dog, a prayer uttered in the grayish morning light. The Holy Family reflects the real complexities of any family, but this is realism filled with vision, dream, and omen. Saramago’s deft psychological portrait of a savior who is at once the Son of God and a young man of this earth is an expert interweaving of poetry and irony, spirituality and irreverence. The result is nothing less than a brilliant skeptic’s wry inquest into the meaning of God and of human existence.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/10/9780156001410.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Gospel According to Jesus Christ', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.83 Pounds, Width: 0.924 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.924}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.83}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '1994-09-28', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Genre Fiction', 'Biographical', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Historical', 'Ancient World'], 'authors': ['Jose Saramago'], 'title': 'The Gospel According to Jesus Christ', 'isbn13': '9780156001410', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0547540043'}, 'isbn': '0156001411', 'isbn10': '0156001411', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547540047', 'binding': 'saleableprint'}]}}
