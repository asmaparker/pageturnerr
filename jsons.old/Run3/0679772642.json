{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'One of our most brilliantly iconoclastic playwrights takes on the art of profession of acting with these words: invent nothing, deny nothing, speak up, stand up, stay out of school. Acting schools, “interpretation,” “sense memory,” “The Method”—David Mamet takes a jackhammer to the idols of contemporary acting, while revealing the true heroism and nobility of the craft. He shows actors how to undertake auditions and rehearsals, deal with agents and directors, engage audiences, and stay faithful to the script, while rejecting the temptations that seduce so many of their colleagues. Bracing in its clarity, exhilarating in its common sense, True and False is as shocking as it is practical, as witty as it is instructive, and as irreverent as it is inspiring.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/44/9780679772644.jpg', 'title_long': 'True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.29982867632 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.29982867632}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 127, 'date_published': '1997-02-22', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Reference'], 'authors': ['David Mamet'], 'title': 'True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor', 'isbn13': '9780679772644', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307806499'}, 'isbn': '0679772642', 'isbn10': '0679772642', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307806499', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
