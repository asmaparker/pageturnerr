{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': '"All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Hucklberry Finn." (Ernest Heminway)<br/><br/>Of all the contenders for the title of The Great American Novel, none has a better claim than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Intended at first as a simple story of a boy\'s adventures in the Mississippi Valley—a sequel to Tom Sawyer—the book grew and matured under Twain\'s hand into a work of immeasurable richness and complexity. More than a century after its publication, the critical debate over the symbolic significance of Huck\'s and Jim\'s voyage is still fresh, and it remains a major work that can be enjoyed at many levels: as an incomparable adventure story and as a classic of American humor. This Penguin Classics edition features an introduction by John Seelye, author of The True Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and explanatory notes by Guy Cardwell.<br/>For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
