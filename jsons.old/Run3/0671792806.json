Covey demonstrates that the answer to these and other dilemmas is principle-centered leadership, a long-term, inside-out approach to developing people and organizations. The key to dealing with the challenges that face us today is to develop a principle-centered core within both ourselves and our organizations. Dr. Covey offers insights and guidelines that can help you apply these principles both at work and at home—leading not just to a new understanding of how to increase quality and productivity, but also to a new appreciation of the importance of building personal and professional relationships. The result is a more balanced, more rewarding, and more effective life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/00/9780671792800.jpg', 'title_long': 'Principle-Centered Leadership', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65256829552 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.84}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65256829552}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4375}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '1992-10-01', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Success', 'Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Business & Professional Growth', 'Self Help', 'Business & Money', 'Business Culture', 'Work Life Balance', 'Management & Leadership', 'Leadership & Motivation', 'Management', 'Business Development & Entrepreneurship', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Stephen R.
