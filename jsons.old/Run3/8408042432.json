Or at least suspect lot. However, his mother, an old ironic and sharp-tongued actress, seems to be running from someone in particular, someone very close, as she and her son wasted day in a desolate coast hotel. Suddenly, Sawyer finds out some very disturbing things about the history of his family, his business and himself, and should be implemented across the country from coast to coast to find a remedy to the illness of his mother. The eventful journey alone would be huge for a 12 years if it were not for his journey does not begin in the same world in which he lives, and that there are things out there willing to arrest him, and because his mission (commissioned by an old bluesman black that deals with an amusement park in low season) affects the fate of more than one world and more than a dying mother, kingdoms, dominions and universes. On the way to the black hotel where the fabulous talisman, axis of worlds is saved, Jack still find out more, most of them unpleasant, about the nature of his quest, the powers that oppose it and about other dying mothers of which it depends very much.
