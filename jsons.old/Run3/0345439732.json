They are children of America\'s post-war generation, as different from one another as anyone can be. Yet they are bound together by the traumas of their pasts, the desperate desire to capture their dreams and satisfy their passions, the stirring pleasures of sexual awakening--and the twists of fate that will inextricably link their lives in the turbulent world of 1960s New York City.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/34/9780345439734.jpg', 'title_long': 'Boys and Girls Together', 'edition': '1st Ballantine Books ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 2.1 pounds, Width: 1.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 768, 'date_published': '2001-07-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'Urban Life', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['William Goldman'], 'title': 'Boys and Girls Together', 'isbn13': '9780345439734', 'msrp': 30, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0345439732', 'isbn10': '0345439732'}}
