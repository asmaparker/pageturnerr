{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster', 'synopsis': 'From the bestselling author of Catch-22, Joseph Heller’s wonderfully inventive second novel Something Happened takes a satirical look at business life and American culture.<br/><br/>Bob Slocum was living the American dream. He had a beautiful wife, three lovely children, a nice house...and all the mistresses he desired. He had it all—all, that is, but happiness. Slocum was discontent. Inevitably, inexorably, his discontent deteriorated into desolation until...something happened.<br/><br/>Something Happened is Joseph Heller’s wonderfully inventive and controversial second novel satirizing business life and American culture. The story is told as if you were overhearing the patter of Bob Slocum’s brain—recording what is going on at the office, as well as his fantasies and memories that complete the story of his life. The result is a novel as original and memorable as his Catch-22.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/12/9780684841212.jpg', 'title_long': 'Something Happened', 'edition': '1st Scribner Ppbk Fiction Ed 1997', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.28309036484 Pounds, Width: 1.44 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.44}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.28309036484}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 576, 'date_published': '1997-11-12', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Joseph Heller'], 'title': 'Something Happened', 'isbn13': '9780684841212', 'msrp': 18, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0684841215', 'isbn10': '0684841215'}}
