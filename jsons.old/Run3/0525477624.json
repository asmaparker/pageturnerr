{'book': {'publisher': 'Dutton Books for Young Readers', 'synopsis': 'Able to claw straight up a brick wall, squeeze through a pipe the width of a quarter, and gnaw through iron and concrete, rats are also revealed in this fascinating book to be incredibly intelligent and capable of great compassion. Weaving science, history, culture, and folklore, awardwinning writer Albert Marrin offers a look at rats that goes from curious to repulsive, horrifying to comic, fearsome to inspiring. Arresting blackand- white scratchboard illustrations with bold red accents add visual punch to this study of a creature that has annoyed, disgusted, nourished, and intrigued its human neighbors throughout the centuries.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/24/9780525477624.jpg', 'title_long': 'Oh, Rats!: The Story of Rats and People', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 10.25 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 48, 'date_published': '2006-08-17', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Mice, Hamsters, Guinea Pigs & Squirrels', 'History'], 'authors': ['Albert Marrin'], 'title': 'Oh, Rats!: The Story of Rats and People', 'isbn13': '9780525477624', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0525477624', 'isbn10': '0525477624'}}
