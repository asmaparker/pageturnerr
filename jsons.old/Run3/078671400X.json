{'book': {'publisher': 'Carroll & Graf', 'synopsis': "Sherlock Holmes once declared: “This world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply.” And when Dr. Mortimer asked if the legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles was not of interest, Holmes said only: “To a collector of fairy-tales.” And yet Conan Doyle, fascinated by psychic phenomena his entire life, and author of many horror and supernatural stories, did give Holmes a few problems of the otherworldly sort, even if they ended in rational explanations.<br/><br/>Featuring an all-star cast of Doyle devotees that includes Caleb Carr and Daniel Stashower, hosts of Baker Street is the third collection of original mystery stories featuring the literary world’s greatest detective (Murder in Baker Street; Murder, My Dear Watson)—and these stories bring Holmes and Watson up against the supernatural. This latest installment in the New Tales of Sherlock Holmes series—edited by Martin H. Greenberg, one of crime fiction's most awarded editors and anthologists—brings the reader more adventures where the ultimate disbelieving detective tackles mysteries with a distinctly strange flavor, featuring crimes and situations that may possibly be not of this world.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/01/9780786714001.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Ghosts in Baker Street : New Tales of Sherlock Holmes', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2006-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'The Ghosts in Baker Street : New Tales of Sherlock Holmes', 'isbn13': '9780786714001', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '078671400X', 'isbn10': '078671400X'}}
