{'book': {'publisher': 'Broadview Press', 'synopsis': 'One of Joseph Conrad’s greatest novels, Lord Jim brilliantly combines adventure and analysis. Haunted by the memory of a moment of lost nerve during a disastrous voyage, Jim submits to condemnation by a Court of Inquiry. In the wake of his disgrace he travels to the exotic region of Patusan, and as the agent at this remote trading post comes to be revered as ‘Tuan Jim.’ Here he finds a measure of serenity and respect within himself. However, when a gang of thieves arrives on the island, the memory of his earlier disgrace comes again to the fore, and his relationship with the people of the island is jeopardized.<br/>This new Broadview edition is based on the first British edition of 1900, which provides the historical basis for the accompanying critical and contextual discussions. The appendices include a wide variety of Conrad’s source material, documents concerning the scandal of the Jeddah, along with other materials such as a substantial selection of early critical comments.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/28/9781551111728.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lord Jim', 'edition': '1st Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.1904962148 Pounds, Width: 0.875 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.875}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1904962148}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 455, 'date_published': '2000-11-07', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Joseph Conrad'], 'title': 'Lord Jim', 'isbn13': '9781551111728', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1460403762'}, 'isbn': '1551111721', 'isbn10': '1551111721', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781460403761', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
