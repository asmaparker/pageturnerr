{'book': {'publisher': 'Sterling', 'synopsis': 'Utterly delightful to read aloud, and for parent and child to share, Edward Lear\'s humorous verses shine with irrepressible joy and rhythm. Filled with exuberantly nonsensical made-up words (like "Scroobius Pip" and "pobble"!) that tickle the funny bone, his work gives free rein to youthful imaginations. What better to foster a love of poetry than the immediately appealing The Owl and the Pussy-Cat, with its effortless rhymes, songlike beat, and charming animal characters? Or The Quangle Wangle\'s Hat, which tells the tale of a creature who warmly welcomes everyone--and so makes everyone cheerful. In Dingle Bank, even some young and mischievous boys punished by their schoolmaster make the best of their situation and succeed in having a good time. Bright and fanciful paintings--all as wildly energetic and unrestrained as the language itself--add to the enjoyment. 20 examples of Lear\'s finest poems will entice children over and over again--and, as always, this acclaimed series features fascinating biographical information, introductions to each verse, and full annotations that define difficult vocabulary.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/70/9780806930770.jpg', 'title_long': 'Poetry for Young People: Edward Lear', 'edition': '2nd prt.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.5 Inches, Length: 8.75 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.00089866948}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.5}}, 'pages': 48, 'date_published': '2001-10-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Poetry for Young People: Edward Lear', 'isbn13': '9780806930770', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0806930772', 'isbn10': '0806930772'}}
