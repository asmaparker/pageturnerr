{'book': {'publisher': 'Gardners Books', 'synopsis': '"Finders Keepers" is a gathering of Seamus Heaney\'s prose of three decades. Whether autobiographical, topical or specifically literary, these essays and lectures circle the central preoccupying questions: How should a poet properly live and write? What is his relationship to be to his own voice, his own place, his literary heritage and the contemporary world? As well as being a selection of the poet\'s three previous collections of prose ("Preoccupations", "The Government of the Tongue", and "The Redress of Poetry"), the present volume includes material from "The Place of Writing", a series of lectures delivered at Emory University in 1988. Also included are a rich variety of pieces not preiously collected in volume form, ranging from short newspaper articles to more extended lectures and contributions to books. In its soundings of a wide range of poets - Irish and British, American and East European, predecessors and contemporaries - "Finders Keepers" is, as its title indicates, "an announcement of both excitement and possession".', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/16/9780571210916.jpg', 'title_long': 'Finders Keepers : Selected Prose 1971-2001', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.19684 Inches, Weight: 0.6062712205 Pounds, Width: 0.55118 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.19684}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.55118}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6062712205}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 422, 'date_published': '2003-04-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'British & Irish'], 'authors': ['Seamus Heaney'], 'title': 'Finders Keepers : Selected Prose 1971-2001', 'isbn13': '9780571210916', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0571210910', 'isbn10': '0571210910'}}
