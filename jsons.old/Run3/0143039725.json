{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': "His mind crowded with vivid images of Africa, Graham Greene set off in 1935 to discover Liberia, a remote and unfamiliar republic founded for released slaves. Now with a new introduction by Paul Theroux, Journey Without Maps is the spellbinding record of Greene's journey. Crossing the red-clay terrain from Sierra Leone to the coast of Grand Bassa with a chain of porters, he came to know one of the few areas of Africa untouched by colonization. Western civilization had not yet impinged on either the human psyche or the social structure, and neither poverty, disease, nor hunger seemed able to quell the native spirit.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/23/9780143039723.jpg', 'title_long': 'Journey Without Maps (Penguin Classics)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.7 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.52}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.7}}, 'pages': 242, 'date_published': '2006-06-27', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Historical', 'Africa', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'History', 'West Africa', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Travel', 'Coastal West Africa', 'General', 'Travel Writing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Graham Greene'], 'title': 'Journey Without Maps (Penguin Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780143039723', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0143039725', 'isbn10': '0143039725'}}
