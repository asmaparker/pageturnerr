He puts forward a passionate defense of separation of church and state, and a strong warning about where the country is heading as the lines between politics and rigid religious fundamentalism are blurred.<br/><br/>Carter describes his reactions to recent disturbing societal trends that involve both religious and political worlds as they increasingly intertwine and include some of the most crucial and controversial issues of the day. Many of these matters are under fierce debate. They include preemptive war, women\'s rights, terrorism, civil liberties, homosexuality, abortion, the death penalty, science and religion, environmental degradation, nuclear arsenals, America\'s global image, fundamentalism, and the melding of religion and politics.<br/><br/>Sustained by his lifelong faith, Jimmy Carter assesses these issues in a balanced and courageous way.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/18/9780743285018.jpg', 'title_long': "Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis", 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 0.58202037168 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.56}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.58202037168}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2006-09-26', 'subjects': ['History', 'World', 'Religious', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies', 'Church & State', 'Sociology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'United States', 'Public Affairs & Policy'], 'authors': ['Jimmy Carter'], 'title': "Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis", 'isbn13': '9780743285018', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0743292367'}, 'isbn': '0743285018', 'isbn10': '0743285018', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780743292368', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
