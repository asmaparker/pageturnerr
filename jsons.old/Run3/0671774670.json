{'book': {'publisher': 'Washington Square Press', 'synopsis': "Capturing all the rueful irony and racial ambivalence of small-town Mississippi in the late 1950s, Melinda Haynes' celebrated novel is a wholly unforgettable exploration of family, identity, and redemption. Mother of Pearl revolves around twenty-eight-year-old Even Grade, a black man who grew up an orphan, and Valuable Korner, the fifteen-year-old white daughter of the town whore and an unknown father. Both are passionately determined to discover the precious things neither experienced as children: human connection, enduring commitment, and, above all, unconditional love. A startlingly accomplished mixture of beauty, mystery, and tragedy, Mother of Pearl marks the debut of an extraordinary literary talent.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/77/9780671774677.jpg', 'title_long': "Mother of Pearl (Oprah's Book Club)", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.14 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.14}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2000-06-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Melinda Haynes'], 'title': "Mother of Pearl (Oprah's Book Club)", 'isbn13': '9780671774677', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0671774670', 'isbn10': '0671774670'}}
