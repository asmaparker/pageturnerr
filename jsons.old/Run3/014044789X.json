{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': 'Ovid’s sensuous and witty poem, in an accessible translation by David Raeburn<br/><br/>In Metamophoses, Ovid brings together a dazzling array of mythological tales, ingeniously linked by the idea of transformation—often as a result of love or lust—where men and women find themselves magically changed into new and sometimes extraordinary beings. Beginning with the creation of the world and ending with the deification of Augustus, Ovid interweaves many of the best-known myths and legends of ancient Greece and Rome, including Daedalus and Icarus, Pyramus and Thisbe, Pygmalion, Perseus and Andromeda, and the fall of Troy. Erudite but light-hearted, dramatic and yet playful, Metamorphoses has influenced writers and artists throughout the centuries from Shakespeare and Titian to Picasso and Ted Hughes.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/97/9780140447897.jpg', 'title_long': 'Metamorphoses (Penguin Classics)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.64173228179 Inches, Length: 7.7952755826 Inches, Weight: 2.1164377152 Pounds, Width: 5.0787401523 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.7952755826}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.0787401523}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.1164377152}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.64173228179}}, 'pages': 768, 'date_published': '2004-08-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Genre Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Poetry', 'Ancient, Classical & Medieval', 'Themes & Styles', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Ancient & Medieval Literature', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Ovid'], 'title': 'Metamorphoses (Penguin Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780140447897', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '014044789X', 'isbn10': '014044789X'}}
