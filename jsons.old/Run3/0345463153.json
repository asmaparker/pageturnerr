{'book': {'publisher': 'Seal', 'synopsis': 'The Fourth Handasks an interesting question: “How can anyone identify a dream of the future?” The answer: “Destiny is not imaginable, except in dreams or to those in love."<br/><br/>While reporting a story from India, a New York television journalist has his left hand eaten by a lion; millions of TV viewers witness the accident. In Boston, a renowned hand surgeon awaits the opportunity to perform the nation’s first hand transplant; meanwhile, in the distracting aftermath of an acrimonious divorce, the surgeon is seduced by his housekeeper. A married woman in Wisconsin wants to give the one-handed reporter her husband’s left hand – that is, after her husband dies. But the husband is alive, relatively young, and healthy.<br/><br/>This is how John Irving’s tenth novel begins; it seems, at first, to be a comedy, perhaps a satire, almost certainly a sexual farce. Yet, in the end, The Fourth Hand is as realistic and emotionally moving as any of Mr. Irving’s previous novels – including The World According to Garp, A Prayer for Owen Meany, and A Widow for One Year – or his Oscar-winning screenplay of The Cider House Rules.<br/><br/>The Fourth Hand is characteristic of John Irving’s seamless storytelling and further explores some of the author’s recurring themes – loss, grief, love as redemption. But this novel also breaks new ground; it offers a penetrating look at the power of second chances and the will to change.<br/><br/>From the Trade Paperback edition.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/59/9780345463159.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Fourth Hand', 'edition': '1st ptg.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.88 Inches, Length: 4.17 Inches, Weight: 0.395 Pounds, Width: 0.98 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.17}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.98}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.395}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.88}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2003-04-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['John Irving'], 'title': 'The Fourth Hand', 'isbn13': '9780345463159', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0345463153', 'isbn10': '0345463153'}}
