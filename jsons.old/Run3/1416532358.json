Yet Duncan is suspicious of the beautiful woman’s story of innocence and his gut tells him her account of the shooting is only partially true.<br/><br/>Determined to learn the dead man’s connection to the Lairds, Duncan investigates further but soon finds his career, and integrity, in jeopardy. Despite his suspicions, Duncan is increasingly drawn to Elise―even if she is a married woman, a proven liar, and a murder suspect.<br/><br/>When Elise seeks Duncan out privately, he initially dismisses her incredible allegation as the manipulative lie of a guilty woman. But if she’s telling the truth, then that single fatal gunshot at her home takes on even more sinister significance, possibly involving Duncan’s nemesis, the brutal crime lord Robert Savich.<br/><br/>And then Elise goes missing...', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/54/9781416532354.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ricochet: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.1 Inches, Length: 6.2 Inches, Weight: 1.04 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.1}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense'], 'authors': ['Sandra Brown'], 'title': 'Ricochet: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9781416532354', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1416532358', 'isbn10': '1416532358'}}
