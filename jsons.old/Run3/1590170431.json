{'book': {'publisher': 'NYRB Classics', 'synopsis': 'Nineteen-year-old Frank Friedmaier lives in a country under occupation. Most people struggle to get by; Frank takes it easy in his mother\'s whorehouse, which caters to members of the occupying forces. But Frank is restless. He is a pimp, a thug, a petty thief, and, as Dirty Snowopens, he has just killed his first man. Through the unrelenting darkness and cold of an endless winter, Frank will pursue abjection until at last there is nowhere to go.<br/><br/>Hans Koning has described Dirty Snow as "one of the very few novels to come out of German-occupied France that gets it exactly right." In a study of the criminal mind that is comparable to Jim Thompson\'s The Killer Inside Me, Simenon maps a no man\'s land of the spirit in which human nature is driven to destruction—and redemption, perhaps, as well—by forces beyond its control.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/34/9781590170434.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dirty Snow (New York Review Books Classics)', 'edition': 'Reprint, Subsequent', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.60406659788 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.60406659788}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2003-08-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'Psychological', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'International Mystery & Crime', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers'], 'authors': ['Georges Simenon'], 'title': 'Dirty Snow (New York Review Books Classics)', 'isbn13': '9781590170434', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1590170431', 'isbn10': '1590170431'}}
