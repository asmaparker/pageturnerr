{'book': {'publisher': 'Gallery Books', 'synopsis': '"There\'s an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it\'s in Texas, probably in Tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can\'t get fooled again."<br/>With signature remarks like these, it\'s hardly surprising that George W. Bush\'s malapropisms have become renowned around the world. Editions of Bushisms have become bestsellers in Germany, France, and Italy, and they remain as popular in the United States as ever. Jacob Weisberg, faithful scribe, here presents the best of the latest crop:<br/>"There\'s only one person who hugs the mothers and the widows, the wives and the kids upon the death of their loved one. Others hug but having committed the troops, I\'ve got an additional responsibility to hug and that\'s me and I know what it\'s like."<br/>"I\'m the master of low expectations."<br/>"First, let me make it very clear, poor people aren\'t necessarily killers. Just because you happen to be not rich doesn\'t mean you\'re willing to kill."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/06/9780743251006.jpg', 'title_long': 'Still More George W.
