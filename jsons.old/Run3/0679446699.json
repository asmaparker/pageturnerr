{'book': {'publisher': 'Knopf', 'synopsis': "Japan's most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II.<br/><br/>In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife's missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria.<br/><br/>Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.<br/><br/>From the Trade Paperback edition.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/99/9780679446699.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle', 'edition': 'F First American Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 2.25 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 611, 'date_published': '1997-10-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Haruki Murakami'], 'title': 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle', 'isbn13': '9780679446699', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0679446699', 'isbn10': '0679446699'}}
