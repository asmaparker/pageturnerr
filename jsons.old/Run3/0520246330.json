{'book': {'publisher': 'University of California Press', 'synopsis': "Despite the dedicated efforts of many individuals and organizations, the great apes―our closest living relatives―are on the very edge of extinction. This sweeping atlas provides a comprehensive overview of what is currently known about all six species of great apes―chimpanzee, bonobo, Sumatran orangutan, Bornean orangutan, eastern gorilla, and western lowland gorilla. Created in association with The Great Apes Survival Project (GRASP), this book gives a thorough background on ape behavior and ecology for each species, including detailed habitat requirements, the apes' ecological role, and the possible consequences of their decline. World Atlas of Great Apes also offers a full description of the threats, current conservation efforts, and additional protection needed for each species across its entire range. Many full-color maps and illustrations make the abundance of information accessible to a broad readership, from specialists and policymakers to general readers concerned about the survival of these charismatic primates.<br/><br/>This book represents the work of a dynamic alliance of many of the world's leading great ape research and conservation organizations. Bringing together United Nations agencies, governments, foundations, and private-sector interests, the project aims to raise the international profile of great ape conservation and to build the political will for further action. Readers learn about work being done by specific organizations in support of great ape conservation, and where conservation is most needed and most likely to be effective.<br/><br/>*Covers all six species of great apes<br/><br/>* Provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive data available<br/><br/>* More than 150 full-color photos<br/><br/>* More than 50 full-color maps and diagrams<br/><br/>Copub: UNEP-WCMC (Royalties from the sale of this book will support the efforts of the conservation of the Great Apes Survival Project)", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/31/9780520246331.jpg', 'title_long': 'World Atlas of Great Apes and their Conservation', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 4.70025542584 Pounds, Width: 1.26 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.26}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 4.70025542584}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11}}, 'pages': 456, 'date_published': '2005-11-01', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Zoology', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Conservation', 'Endangered Species', 'Environment', 'Environmentalism', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Anthropology', 'General'], 'authors': ['Julian Caldecott', 'Lera Miles'], 'title': 'World Atlas of Great Apes and their Conservation', 'isbn13': '9780520246331', 'msrp': 65, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0520246330', 'isbn10': '0520246330'}}
