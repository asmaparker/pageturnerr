{'book': {'publisher': 'Harvard Business Review Press', 'synopsis': 'Companies expect managers to use financial data to allocate resources and run their departments. But many managers can\'t read a balance sheet, wouldn\'t recognize a liquidity ratio, and don\'t know how to calculate return on investment. Worse, they don\'t have any idea where the numbers come from or how reliable they really are. In Financial Intelligence, Karen Berman and Joe Knight teach the basics of finance--but with a twist. Financial reporting, they argue, is as much art as science. Because nobody can quantify everything, accountants always rely on estimates, assumptions, and judgment calls. Savvy managers need to know how those sources of possible bias can affect the financials and that sometimes the numbers can be challenged. While providing the foundation for a deep understanding of the financial side of business, the book also arms managers with practical strategies for improving their companies\' performance--strategies, such as "managing the balance sheet," that are well understood by financial professionals but rarely shared with their nonfinancial colleagues. Accessible, jargon-free, and filled with entertaining stories of real companies, Financial Intelligence gives nonfinancial managers the financial knowledge and confidence for their everyday work. Karen Berman and Joe Knight are the owners of the Los Angeles-based Business Literacy Institute and have trained tens of thousands of managers at many leading organizations. Co-author John Case has written several popular books on management.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/49/9781591397649.jpg', 'title_long': 'financial-intelligence', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Finance', 'Corporate Finance', 'Management & Leadership', 'Management', 'Personal Finance', 'Accounting', 'Financial', 'Managerial', 'Skills', 'Business Writing', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Karen Berman', 'Joe Knight', 'John Case'], 'title': 'financial-intelligence', 'isbn13': '9781591397649', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '1422148149'}, 'isbn': '1591397642', 'isbn10': '1591397642', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781422148143', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
