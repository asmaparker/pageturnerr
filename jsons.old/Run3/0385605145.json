{'book': {'publisher': 'Doubleday', 'synopsis': "Bill Bryson goes to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world.<br/><br/>Kenya, generally regarded as the cradle of mankind, is a land of contrasts, with famous game reserves, stunning landscapes, and a vibrant cultural tradition. It also provides plenty to worry a traveller like Bill Bryson, fixated as he is on the dangers posed by snakes, insects and large predators. But on a more sober note, it is a country that shares many serious human and environmental problems with the rest of Africa: refugees, AIDS, drought and grinding poverty.<br/><br/>Travelling around the country, Bryson casts his inimitable eye on a continent new to him, and the resultant diary, though short in length, contains the trademark Bryson stamp of wry observation and curious insight.<br/><br/>All the author's royalties from Bill Bryson's African Diary, as well as all profits, will go to CARE International.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/44/9780385605144.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bill Bryson African Diary', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.24408 Inches, Length: 5.27558 Inches, Weight: 0.36155768 Pounds, Width: 0.43307 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.27558}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.43307}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.36155768}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.24408}}, 'pages': 69, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'Africa', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'History', 'Kenya', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors': ['Bill Bryson'], 'title': 'Bill Bryson African Diary', 'isbn13': '9780385605144', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0385605145', 'isbn10': '0385605145'}}
