Hal Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the la Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was chopped to pieces. Together, these events constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. Told by the commander of the battalion and the only journalist on the ground through the fighting, this is the devastating, yet inspiring, story of those soldiers who sacrificed themselves for their comrades and never gave up.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/88/9780060506988.jpg', 'title_long': 'We Were Soldiers Once... and Young: Ia Drang--The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 560, 'date_published': '2002-02-05', 'subjects': ['History', 'Military', 'Vietnam War'], 'authors': ['Harold G.
