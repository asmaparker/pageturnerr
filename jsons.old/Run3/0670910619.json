Above him on the window sill rests a bronze statue of Matthew Flinders' cat, Trim. Ryan is a ten-year-old, a near street kid heading for all the usual trouble. The two meet and form an unlikely friendship. Appealing to the boy's imagination by telling him the story of the circumnavigation of Australia as seen through Trim's eyes, Billy is drawn deeply into Ryan's life and into the Sydney underworld. Over several months the two begin the mutual process of rehabilitation. Matthew Flinders' Cat is a modern-day story of a city, its crime, the plight of the homeless and the politics of greed and perversion. It is also a story of the human heart, with an enchanting glimpse into our past form the viewpoint of a famous cat.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/18/9780670910618.jpg', 'title_long': "Matthew Flinders' Cat", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 2.1 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.1}}, 'pages': 624, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Bryce Courtenay'], 'title': "Matthew Flinders' Cat", 'isbn13': '9780670910618', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0670910619', 'isbn10': '0670910619'}}
