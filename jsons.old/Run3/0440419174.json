{'book': {'publisher': 'Yearling', 'synopsis': 'This "lively, beautifully written biography" (Kirkus Reviews) of the famous Post-Impressionist artist who painted Starry Night and many other masterpieces is "fascinating reading" (School Library Journal, Starred Review).<br/><br/>Vincent Van Gogh—one of the nineteenth century\'s most brilliant artist—will forever be remembered as the Dutchman who pioneered new techniques and styles and who, in a fit of passion, cut off his own ear.<br/><br/>Whether painting a portrait, landscape, or still life, van Gogh sought to capture the vibrant spirit of his subject. Still, fame eluded him. This lack of recognition over a career spanning a mere decade (from ages twenty-seven to thirty-seven) fueled his lifelong self-doubt and bitter disappointments. Today, however, van Gogh\'s paintings are recognized as masterpieces, and the tormented Dutchman stands as a giant among artists.<br/><br/>Vincent Van Gogh: Portrait of An Artist has been selected as a Common Core State Standards Text Exemplar (Grades 6–8, Historical/Social Studies) in Appendix B. It features a sixteen-page insert with family photographs and full-color painting reproductions and includes a glossary of artists and terms, a biographical time line, notes, a bibliography, and locations of museums that display Van Gogh’s work.<br/><br/>A ROBERT F.
