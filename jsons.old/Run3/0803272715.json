{'book': {'publisher': 'University of Nebraska Press', 'synopsis': 'G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831), the influential German philosopher, believed that human history was advancing spiritually and morally according to God’s purpose. At the beginning of this masterwork, Hegel writes: “What the history of Philosophy shows us is a succession of noble minds, a gallery of heroes of thought, who, by the power of Reason, have penetrated into the being of things, of nature and of spirit, into the Being of God, and have won for us by their labours the highest treasure, the treasure of reasoned knowledge.”<br/><br/>In his introduction to this Bison Book edition, Frederick C. Beiser notes the complex and controversial history of Hegel’s text. He makes a case that this English-language translation by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson is still the most reliable one.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/12/9780803272712.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 1: Greek Philosophy to Plato', 'edition': 'New Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 1.25002102554 Pounds, Width: 1.19 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.19}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.25002102554}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 487, 'date_published': '1995-06-01', 'subjects': ['History', 'Europe', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'History & Surveys'], 'authors': ['Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'], 'title': 'Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 1: Greek Philosophy to Plato', 'isbn13': '9780803272712', 'msrp': 33.73, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0803272715', 'isbn10': '0803272715'}}
