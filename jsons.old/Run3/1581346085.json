{'book': {'publisher': 'Crossway Books', 'synopsis': "Denying that Christ suffered and died is like denying the Holocaust. For some it is simply too horrific to affirm. Others suspect it is an elaborate religious conspiracy to coerce sympathy. Those who deny either event live in a historical dreamworld. Jesus suffered unspeakably and died.<br/>The Passion of Jesus Christ shows that the gore of Christ's suffering is turned to glory by the enormity and diversity of what his death achieved. To do this, John Piper uncovers fifty accomplishments of Christ's suffering. He shuns embellishment and shows from the Bible key evidence for each outcome of Christ's death.<br/>When it is all said and done, the most crucial question is: Why? Why did Christ suffer and die? The answer has everything to do with you.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/84/9781581346084.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Passion of Jesus Christ: Fifty Reasons Why He Came to Die', 'edition': '1st Paperback Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2004-01-09', 'subjects': ['History', 'World', 'Religious', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies'], 'authors': ['John Piper'], 'title': 'The Passion of Jesus Christ: Fifty Reasons Why He Came to Die', 'isbn13': '9781581346084', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1581346085', 'isbn10': '1581346085'}}
