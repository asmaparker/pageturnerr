{'book': {'publisher': 'Delacorte Books for Young Readers', 'synopsis': "No one ever really paid close attention to the faces of the missing children on the milk cartons. But as Janie Johnson glanced at the face of the ordinary little girl with her hair in tight pigtails, wearing a dress with a narrow white collar--a three-year-old who had been kidnapped twelve years before from a shopping mall in New Jersey--she felt overcome with shock. She recognized that little girl--it was she. How could it possibly be true?<br/><br/>Janie can't believe that her loving parents kidnapped her, but as she begins to piece things together, nothing makes sense. Something is terribly wrong. Are Mr. and Mrs. Johnson really Janie's parents? And if not, who is Janie Johnson, and what really happened?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/84/9780385323284.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Face on the Milk Carton', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.51 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.51}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '1996-04-13', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Mysteries & Detectives', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Mysteries & Thrillers', 'Mystery & Detective'], 'authors': ['Caroline B.
