{'book': {'publisher': "Everyman's Library", 'synopsis': 'Written over a period of more than half a century, Leo Tolstoy’s stories reflect every aspect of his art and personality. They cover his experiences as a soldier in the Caucasus, his married life, his passionate interest in the peasantry, his cult of truth and simplicity, and his growing preoccupation with religion.<br/><br/>The stories in Volume 1 of the Collected Shorter Fiction date from the period in which the young Tolstoy wrote Anna Karenina and War and Peace. Ranging from brief, masterfully sketches of military life such as “The Wood-Felling” to novellas like Family Happiness, an uneasy imagining of the idyllic possibilities of marriage by the not-yet-married writer, all feature Tolstoy’s characteristically lavish deployment of detail, shrewd observation, and imaginative power.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/24/9780375411724.jpg', 'title_long': "Collected Shorter Fiction: Volume 1 (Everyman's Library)", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.3 Inches, Weight: 1.69094554954 Pounds, Width: 1.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.69094554954}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.3}}, 'pages': 848, 'date_published': '2001-08-07', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Leo Tolstoy'], 'title': "Collected Shorter Fiction: Volume 1 (Everyman's Library)", 'isbn13': '9780375411724', 'msrp': 27.5, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307806650', 'ePub': '0307806650'}, 'isbn': '0375411720', 'isbn10': '0375411720', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307806659', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
