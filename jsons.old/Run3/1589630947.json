{'book': {'publisher': 'International Law & Taxation', 'synopsis': 'In \x93The Lighthouse at the End of the World,\x94 Jules Verne is seen at his simplest and best. No antecedent improbability here has to be made good. The remoteness of the scene where the drama is laid supplies an element of dread of which advantage is skillfully taken, and the shortness of the period over which the story is extended adds excitement to the race against time which the villains of the piece are compelled to make in their attempt to escape justice. The rest is pure action, courage and resourcefulness pitted against ferocity and power of numbers, with no merely invented complications to retard the issue. As a simple adventure story \x93The lighthouse at the End of the World\x94 must be declared a little masterpiece.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/49/9781589630949.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Lighthouse at the End of the World', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 inches, Length: 5 inches, Weight: 0.63052206932 Pounds, Width: 0.65 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63052206932}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 260, 'date_published': '2001-03-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['Jules Verne'], 'title': 'The Lighthouse at the End of the World', 'isbn13': '9781589630949', 'msrp': 10.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1589630947', 'isbn10': '1589630947'}}
