Now, in this volume of all-new, never-before-released material, Paramhansa Yogananda? who has hundreds of thousands of followers and admirers in North America?playfully and powerfully explains virtually everything needed to lead a happier, more fulfilling life. Topics covered include: looking for happiness in the right places; choosing to be happy; tools and techniques for achieving happiness; sharing happiness with others; balancing success and happiness, and many more.
