{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "From Kevin Brockmeier, one of this generation's most inventive young writers, comes a striking new novel about death, life, and the mysterious place in between.<br/><br/>The City is inhabited by those who have departed Earth but are still remembered by the living. They will reside in this afterlife until they are completely forgotten. But the City is shrinking, and the residents clearing out. Some of the holdouts, like Luka Sims, who produces the Cityâ€™s only newspaper, are wondering what exactly is going on. Others, like Coleman Kinzler, believe it is the beginning of the end. Meanwhile, Laura Byrd is trapped in an Antarctic research station, her supplies are running low, her radio finds only static, and the power is failing. With little choice, Laura sets out across the ice to look for help, but time is running out. Kevin Brockmeier alternates these two storylines to create a lyrical and haunting story about love, loss and the power of memory.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/57/9781400095957.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Brief History of the Dead', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.69}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.96}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2007-01-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Metaphysical & Visionary', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopian', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Kevin Brockmeier'], 'title': 'The Brief History of the Dead', 'isbn13': '9781400095957', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1400095956', 'isbn10': '1400095956', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780375424236', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
