{'book': {'publisher': 'WaterBrook', 'synopsis': 'And now back to our regularly scheduled insanity.<br/><br/>Channel 7 news producer Hugo Talley dreams of working with first-class professionals. Instead he’s saddled with a weatherman who can’t admit when he’s wrong, an aging anchorwoman who refuses to release her clawlike grip on the newsdesk, a conscience-stricken reporter who’s reluctant to focus on sensationalism, and a new assistant–former homeschool student Hayden Hazard–who can’t just seem to leave her faith outside the newsroom.<br/><br/>When the Channel News 7 team inadvertently stumbles on a hot news story, Hugo is frantic to exploit this rare opportunity. But a series of crises–including a Botox disaster and the disappearance of a colleague–threatens to destroy his chance for ratings success and send him completely over the edge.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Hayden’s presence is distracting at least two coworkers. Softspoken reporter Ray Duffey isn’t sure whether he’s attracted or frightened by her outspoken faith, while ego-driven Sam Leege is certain her naïve spiritual convictions will fall victim to his persuasive attentions.<br/><br/>With their oddball antics and all-too-real foibles, this lovable cast of characters offers a hilarious look at the sometimes-unexpected effects of taking one’s faith boldly into the workplace.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/79/9781400071579.jpg', 'title_long': 'Scoop (Occupational Hazards, Book 1)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2006-10-10', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Rene Gutteridge'], 'title': 'Scoop (Occupational Hazards, Book 1)', 'isbn13': '9781400071579', 'msrp': 12.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307499626'}, 'isbn': '1400071577', 'isbn10': '1400071577', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307499622', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
