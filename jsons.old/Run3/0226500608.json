{'book': {'publisher': 'University of Chicago Press', 'synopsis': 'From its first magnificent sentence, "In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing", to the last, "I am haunted by waters", A River Runs through It is an American classic.<br/><br/>Based on Norman Maclean\'s childhood experiences, A River Runs through It has established itself as one of the most moving stories of our time; it captivates readers with vivid descriptions of life along Montana\'s Big Blackfoot River and its near magical blend of fly fishing with the troubling affections of the heart.<br/><br/>This handsome edition is designed and illustrated by Barry Moser. There are thirteen two-color wood engravings.<br/><br/>"A masterpiece. . . . This is more than stunning fiction: It is a lyric record of a time and a life, shining with Maclean\'s special gift for calling the reader\'s attention to arts of all kinds—the arts that work in nature, in personality, in social intercourse, in fly-fishing."—Kenneth M. Pierce, Village Voice<br/><br/>"Wise, witty, wonderful, Maclean spins his tales, casts his flies, fishes the rivers and woods for what he remembers of his youth in the Rockies."—Barbara Bannon, Publishers Weekly<br/><br/>"Maclean\'s book is surely destined to be one of those rare memoirs that can be called a masterpiece. . . . Earthy, whimsical, authoritative, wise; it touches the heart without blushing and traces lasting images for the eye. . . . This book is a gem."—Nick Lyons, Fly-Fisherman', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/07/9780226500607.jpg', 'title_long': 'A River Runs through It', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.81350574678 Pounds, Width: 1.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.81350574678}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 161, 'date_published': '1989-05-15', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Culinary', 'Regional U.S.', 'West', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Biographical', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States'], 'authors': ['Norman Maclean'], 'title': 'A River Runs through It', 'isbn13': '9780226500607', 'msrp': 32.5, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0226500608', 'isbn10': '0226500608'}}
