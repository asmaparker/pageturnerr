Agnes comes from a respectable middle-class family, but their financial reverses have forced her to seek work as a governess. Pampered and protected at home, she is unprepared for the harsh reality of a governess’s life. At the Bloomfields and later the Murrays, she suffers under the snobbery and sadism of the selfish, self-indulgent upper-class adults and the shrieking insolence of their spoiled children. Worse, the unique social and economic position of a governess―“beneath” her employers but “above” their servants―condemns her to a life of loneliness. &&L/P&&R&&LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&&R &&L/P&&R&&LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&&RLess celebrated than her older sisters Charlotte and Emily, &&LSTRONG&&RAnne Bronte&&L/B&&R was also less interested in spinning wildly symbolic, romantic tales and more determined to draw realistic images of conditions in Victorian England that need changing. While Charlotte’s &&LI&&RJane Eyre&&L/I&&R features a governess who eventually and improbably marries her employer, &&LI&&RAgnes Grey&&L/I&&R deals with the actual experiences of middle-class working women, experiences Anne had herself endured during her hateful tenure as a governess. &&L/P&&R&&LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&&R &&L/P&&R&&LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&&R&&LSTRONG&&RFred Schwarzbach&&L/B&&R&&L/B&&R serves as Associate Dean and teaches in the General Studies Program of New York University.
