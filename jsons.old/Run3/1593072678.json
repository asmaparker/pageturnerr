{'book': {'publisher': 'Dark Horse Comics', 'synopsis': 'In 2002, The Ring came to American silver screens and brought a whole new style of horror and suspense to the States. Based on a series of novels by Suzuki Koji, The Ring became a media franchise in Japan with its fascinatingly creepy, yet scientific and otherworldly subject matter. Not to mention its very scary "monster," the spirit of a girl whose body was dropped in a well many years past. As you\'ll find reading through Dark Horse\'s series of Ring manga, this story is rich with an undergrowth of science and hatred, of strong will behind the murderous ghost of Sadako. Birthday, the fourth in a series of five Ring manga, is a trilogy of stories, each enriching the main storyline of The Ring series. "The Casket Floating in the Sky" centers on Mai Takano, and how she becomes wrapped deeper into Sadako\'s grasp. "Lemon Heart" tells of one of Sadako\'s early loves, and eerily wraps itself back into the plotline of Mai Takano. The "Sadako" story goes into the depths of both Sadako\'s death and her rebirth. Slowly, the details of how The Ring truly works are trickling out into the daylight.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/74/9781593072674.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Ring, Vol. 4: Birthday', 'edition': 'Right to Left Format', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2004-11-16', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Horror', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse'], 'authors': ['Hiroshi Takahashi'], 'title': 'The Ring, Vol. 4: Birthday', 'isbn13': '9781593072674', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1593072678', 'isbn10': '1593072678'}}
