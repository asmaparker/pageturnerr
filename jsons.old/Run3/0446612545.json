His brother Peter is a servant of the rich, parking the cars of the Hamptons' elite-and perhaps satisfying their more intimate needs as well. Then Peter's body is found on the beach. Jack knows the drowning was no accident, but someone's unlimited power and money have bought the cops, the judges, the system. Now Jack is learning a lesson in justice he never got in law school ... and his astonishing plan to beat the billionaires will have you reeling-and cheering-to the very last page.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/48/9780446612548.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Beach House', 'edition': 'Later Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.875 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 1.125 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.125}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.875}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-05-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['James Patterson', 'Peter de Jonge'], 'title': 'The Beach House', 'isbn13': '9780446612548', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0446612545', 'isbn10': '0446612545'}}
