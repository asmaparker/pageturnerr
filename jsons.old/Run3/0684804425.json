{'book': {'publisher': 'Scribner', 'synopsis': 'A fascinating study in self-satire that brings to life the Hollywood years of F. Scott Fitzgerald<br/>The setting: Hollywood: the character: Pat Hobby, a down-and-out screenwriter trying to break back into show business, but having better luck getting into bars. Written between 1939 and 1940, when F. Scott Fitzgerald was working for Universal Studios, the seventeen Pat Hobby stories were first published in Esquire magazine and present a bitterly humorous portrait of a once-successful writer who becomes a forgotten hack on a Hollywood lot. "This was not art" Pat Hobby often said, "this was an industry" where whom "you sat with at lunch was more important than what you dictated in your office."<br/>The Pat Hobby sequence, as Arnold Gingrich writes in his introduction, is Fitzgerald\'s "last word from his last home, for much of what he felt about Hollywood and about himself permeated these stories."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/22/9780684804422.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Pat Hobby Stories', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.45415172 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45415172}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '1995-12-06', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Action & Adventure', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Humorous', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['F.
