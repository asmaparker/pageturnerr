{'book': {'publisher': 'Pocket Books', 'synopsis': "In the gripping new novel from the Queen of Suspense, a woman is haunted by two grisly murders separated by more than a century, yet somehow inextricably linked...<br/><br/>Following a nasty divorce and the trauma of being stalked, criminal defense attorney Emily Graham leaves Albany to work in Manhattan. Craving roots, she buys her ancestral home, a Victorian house in the seaside resort town of Spring Lake, New Jersey. Her family sold the house in 1892, after one of Emily's forebears, Madeline Shapley, then a young girl, disappeared.<br/><br/>As the house is renovated and a pool dug, a skeleton is found and identified as Martha Lawrence, a young Spring Lake woman who vanished several years ago. Within her hand is the finger bone of another woman, with a ring—a Shapley family heirloom—still on it. Determined to find the connection between the two murders, Emily becomes a threat to a seductive killer...who chooses her as the next victim.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/38/9780671004538.jpg', 'title_long': 'On the Street Where You Live', 'edition': '1st Printing 2002', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.440924524}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2002-04-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Cozy', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Mary Higgins Clark'], 'title': 'On the Street Where You Live', 'isbn13': '9780671004538', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0743206312'}, 'isbn': '0671004530', 'isbn10': '0671004530', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780743206310', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
