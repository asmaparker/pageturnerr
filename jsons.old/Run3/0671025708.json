{'book': {'publisher': 'Pocket Books', 'synopsis': "In this city, you can get anything done for a price. If you want someone's eyeglasses smashed, it'll cost you a subway token. You want his fingernails pulled out? His legs broken? You want him hurt so bad he's an invalid his whole life? You want him...killed? Let me talk to someone. It can be done.<br/>The hanging death of a nondescript old man in a shabby little apartment in a meager section of the 87th Precinct is nothing much in this city, especially to detectives Carella and Meyer. But everyone has a story, and this old man's story stood to make some people a lot of money. His story takes Carella, Meyer, Brown, and Weeks on a search through Isola's seedy strip clubs and to the bright lights of the theater district. There they discover an upcoming musical with ties to a mysterious drug -- and a killer who stays until the last dance.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/00/9780671025700.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Last Dance (87th Precinct, Book 50)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 1 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2000-12-01', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Ed McBain'], 'title': 'The Last Dance (87th Precinct, Book 50)', 'isbn13': '9780671025700', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0671025708', 'isbn10': '0671025708'}}
