{'book': {'publisher': 'Knopf', 'synopsis': 'A powerful new collection from one of our most beloved, admired, and honored writers.<br/><br/>In stories that are more personal than any that she’s written before, Alice Munro pieces her family’s history into gloriously imagined fiction. A young boy is taken to Edinburgh’s Castle Rock, where his father assures him that on a clear day he can see America, and he catches a glimpse of his father’s dream. In stories that follow, as the dream becomes a reality, two sisters-in-law experience very different kinds of passion on the long voyage to the New World; a baby is lost and magically reappears on a journey from an Illinois homestead to the Canadian border.<br/><br/>Other stories take place in more familiar Munro territory, the towns and countryside around Lake Huron, where the past shows through the present like the traces of a glacier on the landscape and strong emotions stir just beneath the surface of ordinary comings and goings. First love flowers under the apple tree, while a stronger emotion presents itself in the barn. A girl hired as summer help, and uneasy about her “place” in the fancy resort world she’s come to, is transformed by her employer’s perceptive parting gift. A father whose early expectations of success at fox farming have been dashed finds strange comfort in a routine night job at an iron foundry. A clever girl escapes to college and marriage.<br/><br/>Evocative, gripping, sexy, unexpected—these stories reflect a depth and richness of experience. The View from Castle Rock is a brilliant achievement from one of the finest writers of our time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/21/9781400042821.jpg', 'title_long': 'The View from Castle Rock: Stories', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.99 Inches, Length: 6.76 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.22 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.76}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.22}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.99}}, 'pages': 349, 'date_published': '2006-11-07', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Alice Munro'], 'title': 'The View from Castle Rock: Stories', 'isbn13': '9781400042821', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307266028', 'ePub': '0307266028'}, 'isbn': '1400042828', 'isbn10': '1400042828', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307266026', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
