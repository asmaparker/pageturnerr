Published here in a lucid reworking of Max MÃ¼ller's classic translation, the Critique is a profound investigation into the nature of human reason, establishing its truth, falsities, illusions, and reality.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
