{'book': {'publisher': 'HMH Books for Young Readers', 'synopsis': "Ansul was once a peaceful town filled with libraries, schools, and temples. But that was long ago, and the conquerors of this coastal city consider reading and writing to be acts punishable by death. And they believe the Oracle House, where the last few undestroyed books are hidden, is seething with demons. But to seventeen-year-old Memer, the house is a refuge, a place of family and learning, ritual and memory--the only place where she feels truly safe.<br/><br/>Then an Uplands poet named Orrec and his wife, Gry, arrive, and everything in Memer's life begins to change. Will she and the people of Ansul at last be brave enough to rebel against their oppressors?<br/><br/>A haunting and gripping coming-of-age story set against a backdrop of violence, intolerance, and magic, Voices is a novel that readers will not soon forget.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/80/9780152056780.jpg', 'title_long': 'Voices (2) (Annals of the Western Shore)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2006-09-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Girls & Women', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Ursula K.
