{'book': {'publisher': 'IVP', 'synopsis': "Hip-hop is here. The beats ring out in our cities. Hip-hop culture is all around us: in the clothes youth wear, in the music they listen to, in the ways they express themselves. It is the language they speak, the rhythm they move to. It is a culture familiar with the hard realities of our broken world; the generation raised with rap knows about the pain. They need to know about the hope. Enter the hip-hop church. Like the culture it rises from, the hip-hop church is relevant and bold. And it speaks to the heart. In this book, pastors Efrem Smith and Phil Jackson show the urgency of connecting hip-hop culture and church to reach a generation with the gospel of Jesus Christ. They give practical ideas from their urban churches and other hip-hop churches about how to engage and incorporate rap, break dancing, poetry and deejays to worship Jesus and preach his Word. Hip-hop culture is shaping the next generation. Ignoring it will not reduce its influence; it will only separate us from the youth moving to its rhythm. How will they hear Christ's message of truth and hope if we don't speak their language? And how can we speak their language if we don't understand and embrace their culture? Hear the beat. Join the beat. Become the beat that brings truth and hope to a hungry, hurting generation.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/90/9780830833290.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Hip-Hop Church: Connecting with the Movement Shaping Our Culture', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.53}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 227, 'date_published': '2005-12-15', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Churches & Church Leadership', 'Church Administration', 'Pastoral Resources', 'Ministry & Evangelism', 'Missions & Missionary Work', 'Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Musical Genres', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Sociology', 'Urban'], 'authors': ['Efrem Smith', 'Phil Jackson'], 'title': 'The Hip-Hop Church: Connecting with the Movement Shaping Our Culture', 'isbn13': '9780830833290', 'msrp': 10.38, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0830833293', 'isbn10': '0830833293'}}
