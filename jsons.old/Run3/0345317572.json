{'book': {'publisher': 'Del Rey', 'synopsis': "Landover was a genuine, out-of-this-world magic kingdom, complete with fairy folk and wizardry, just as the advertisement had promised. But after he purchased it for a million dollars, Ben Holiday discovered that there were a few details the ad had failed to mention.<br/><br/>The kingdom was falling into ruin. The dragon Strabo was laying waste the countryside and the evil witch Nightshade was plotting to destroy everything. Ben's only followers were the incompetent Court Magician, Questar Thews, and Abernathy, the talking dog who served as Court Scribe. The Paladin, legendary champion of the Kings of Landover, seemed to be only a myth and an empty suit of armor. Of course, there was the lovely and devoted Willow -- but she had a habit of putting down roots in the moonlight and turning into a tree.<br/><br/>To put the final touch on the whole affair, Ben learned that the Iron Mark, ugly and terrible lord of the demons, had challenged all prospective Kings of Landover to a duel to the death -- a duel which no human could hope to win.<br/><br/>The task of proving his right to be King seemed hopeless. But Ben Holiday was stubborn.<br/><br/>A gripping story of mystery, magic, and adventure -- sure to delight fantasy readers everywhere.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/75/9780345317575.jpg', 'title_long': 'Magic Kingdom For Sale--Sold!
