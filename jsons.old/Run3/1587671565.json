On this particular night a stranger steps out of the shadowy park to sit at the sidewalk tables and speak of love and murder.<br/><br/>In "A Madness of Starlings," a father, teaching his children about protection from the predators of life, takes in a fledgling bird. But when it\'s time for the bird to fly away, the forces of nature come undone and a secret wisdom and terror enter the mind of the one who understands the language of birds.<br/><br/>Finally, in "The Dark Game," a war hero and his men are captured and taken into a prison camp. There, tortures and torments await them, but the man named Gordon Raglan begins to use a childhood game of escape to help him discover a way to hunt the wolves surrounding him.<br/><br/>Wild Things: Four Tales is a unique and exclusive Cemetery Dance book, with no other editions planned anywhere in the world at this time!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/62/9781587671562.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wild Things: Four Tales', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.52}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 100, 'date_published': '2006-10-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror'], 'authors': ['Douglas Clegg'], 'title': 'Wild Things: Four Tales', 'isbn13': '9781587671562', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1587671565', 'isbn10': '1587671565'}}
