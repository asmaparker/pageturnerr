{'book': {'publisher': 'Bloomsbury USA', 'synopsis': "Very evil....very funny<br/><br/>A lethal joyride into today's new breed of technogeeks, Douglas Coupland's new novel updates Microserfs for the age of Google.<br/>Ethan Jarlewski and five co-workers are bureaucratically marooned in JPod, a no-escape architectural limbo on the fringes of a massive Vancouver video game design company.<br/>The six JPodders wage daily battle against the demands of a boneheaded marketing staff, who daily torture employees with idiotic changes to already idiotic games. Meanwhile, Ethan's personal life is shaped (or twisted) by phenomena as disparate as Hollywood, marijuana grow-ops, people-smuggling, ballroom dancing, and the rise of China. JPod's universe is amoral and shameless - and dizzyingly fast-paced. The characters are products of their era even as they're creating it. Everybody in Ethan's life inhabits a moral grey zone. Nobody is exempt, not even his seemingly straitlaced parents or Coupland himself. Full of word games, visual jokes, and sideways jabs, this book throws a sharp, pointed lawn dart into the heart of contemporary life. JPod is Douglas Coupland at the top of his game.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/48/9781596911048.jpg', 'title_long': 'JPod', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.53 Inches, Length: 6.42 Inches, Weight: 1.75 Pounds, Width: 1.5649575 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.42}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5649575}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.53}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2006-05-16', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous'], 'authors': ['Douglas Coupland'], 'title': 'JPod', 'isbn13': '9781596911048', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1596911042', 'isbn10': '1596911042'}}
