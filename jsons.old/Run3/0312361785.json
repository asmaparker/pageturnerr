{'book': {'publisher': "St. Martin's Griffin", 'synopsis': "Joe College is Tom Perrotta's warmest and funniest fiction yet, a comic journey into the dark side of love, higher education and food service.<br/><br/>For many college students, Spring Break means fun and sun in Florida. For Danny, a Yale junior, it means two weeks behind the wheel of the Roach Coach, his father's lunch truck, which plies the parking lots of office parks in central New Jersey.<br/><br/>But Danny can use the time behind the coffee urn to try and make sense of a love life that's gotten a little complicated. There's loyal and patient hometown honey Cindy and her recently dropped bombshell to contend with. And there's also lissome Polly back in New Haven--with her shifting moods, perfect thrift store dresses and inconvenient liaison with a dashing professor.<br/><br/>If girl problems aren't enough, there's the constant menace of the Lunch Monsters, a group of thugs who think Danny has planted the Roach Coach in their territory.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/85/9780312361785.jpg', 'title_long': 'Joe College: A Novel', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2006-09-19', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Tom Perrotta'], 'title': 'Joe College: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780312361785', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0312361785', 'isbn10': '0312361785', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781429907804', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
