{'book': {'publisher': 'Tor Books', 'synopsis': 'For connoisseurs of imaginative fiction, the novels of Jonathan Carroll are a special treat that occupy a space all their own. His surreal fictions, which deftly mix the everyday with the extraordinary, have won him a devoted following. Now, in Glass Soup, Carroll continues to astound . . . .<br/><br/>The realm of the dead is built from the dreams--and nightmares--of the living. Octopuses drive buses. God is a polar bear. And a crowded highway literally leads to hell.<br/><br/>Once before, Vincent Ettrich and his lover, Isabelle Neukor, crossed over from life to death and back again. Now Isabelle bears a very special child, who may someday restore the ever-changing mosaic that is reality. Unless the agents of Chaos can lure her back to the land of the dead--and trap her there forever.<br/><br/>Glass Soup is another exquisite and singular creation from the author January magazine described as "incapable of writing a bad book much less an uninteresting one."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/01/9780765311801.jpg', 'title_long': 'Glass Soup', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.71 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.71}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2006-11-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Magical Realism'], 'authors': ['Jonathan Carroll'], 'title': 'Glass Soup', 'isbn13': '9780765311801', 'msrp': 22.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0765311801', 'isbn10': '0765311801'}}
