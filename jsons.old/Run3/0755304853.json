{'book': {'publisher': 'Headline Book Publishing', 'synopsis': 'As a teenager, Maddy Harvey was a bit of an ugly duckling, but thankfully she’s blossomed since then. But when she meets Kerr McKinnon one summer’s night and discovers, days later, who he really is, that’s when the real problems start. Because everyone in Ashcombe knows what happened 11 years ago, and as far as her mother Marcella is concerned, she would rather tear that family to pieces with her bare hands than see Maddy associate with a McKinnon. And, okay, maybe Marcella isn’t her real mother, but Maddy owes her so much. It’s Romeo and Juliet all over again. Quick, hide those sharp knives and that little bottle of poison.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/51/9780755304851.jpg', 'title_long': 'Falling for You', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.7 Inches, Length: 4.3 Inches, Weight: 0.51367707046 Pounds, Width: 1.11 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.11}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.51367707046}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.7}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2004-08-01', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Jill Mansell'], 'title': 'Falling for You', 'isbn13': '9780755304851', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0755304853', 'isbn10': '0755304853'}}
