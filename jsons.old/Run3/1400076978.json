{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'WINNER OF THE KIRIYAMA PRIZE • If Gabriel García Márquez had chosen to write about Pakistani immigrants in England, he might have produced a novel as beautiful and devastating as Maps for Lost Lovers.<br/><br/>Jugnu and Chanda have disappeared. Like thousands of people all over England, they were lovers and living together out of wedlock. To Chanda’s family, however, the disgrace was unforgivable. Perhaps enough so as to warrant murder.<br/><br/>As he explores the disappearance and its aftermath through the eyes of Jugnu’s worldly older brother, Shamas, and his devout wife, Kaukab, Nadeem Aslam creates a closely observed and affecting portrait of people whose traditions threaten to bury them alive. The result is a tour de force, intimate, affecting, tragic and suspenseful.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/70/9781400076970.jpg', 'title_long': 'Maps for Lost Lovers: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.01 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.86 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.16}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.01}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2006-05-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'Psychological', 'British & Irish', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Nadeem Aslam'], 'title': 'Maps for Lost Lovers: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9781400076970', 'msrp': 14.48, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307426785', 'ePub': '0307426785'}, 'isbn': '1400076978', 'isbn10': '1400076978', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307426789', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
