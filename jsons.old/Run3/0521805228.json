{'book': {'publisher': 'Plenum Press', 'synopsis': "Charles Taylor is one of the most distinctive figures in the landscape of contemporary philosophy. His ability to contribute to philosophical conversations across a wide spectrum of ideas is especially impressive in a time of increasing specialization. These areas include moral theory, theories of subjectivity, political theory, epistemology, hermeneutics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language and aesthetics. Most recently, Taylor has branched into the study of religion. Written by a team of international authorities, this collection will be read primarily by students and academic professionals in philosophy, political science, and religious studies, and will also appeal to a broad swathe of professionals across the humanities and social sciences. Ruth Abbey is Senior Lecturer in Political Theory at University of Kent at Canterbury. She has published numerous articles and is author of Nietzsche's Middle Period (Oxford University Press, 2000) and Philosophy Now: Charles Taylor (Princeton University Press, 2000).", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/23/9780521805223.jpg', 'title_long': 'Methods of Protein Separation (Biological Separations)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.000625 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.000625}}, 'pages': 281, 'date_published': '1975', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Mathematics'], 'authors': ['Nicholas Catsimpoolas'], 'title': 'Methods of Protein Separation (Biological Separations)', 'isbn13': '9780521805223', 'msrp': 32.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0521805228', 'isbn10': '0521805228', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780511162633', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
