Only the intervention of Nakia's stepson, Prince Kail, saved Yuri from the Queen's bloodthirsty intentions. As an unintended consequence, the people of the kingdoms of Anatolia have embraced Yuri as the incarnation of the great war-goddess Ishtar.<br/><br/>Queen Nakia decides to prevent Yuri from ever returning to Japan by destroying one of the seven springs of Hattusa. Yuri races to stop her, but an omen compels her to ride to Kail, who is fighting the Egyptians in Ugarit. Her action tips the balance in favor of the outnumbered Hittites, and Kail is thrilled that she has chosen to stay in his age so they can be together.
