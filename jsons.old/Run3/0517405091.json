Believed to be possessed, she is brought to a convent for observation. And into her cell stumbles Father Cayetano Delaura, who has already dreamed about a girl with hair trailing after her like a bridal train. As he tends to her with holy water and sacramental oils, Delaura feels something shocking begin to occur. He has fallen in love – and it is not long until Sierva Maria joins him in his fevered misery. Unsettling and indelible, <i>Of Love and Other Demons</i> is an evocative, majestic tale of the most universal experiences known to woman and man.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/93/9780517405093.jpg', 'title_long': 'Of Love and Other Demons', 'dimensions': 'weight: 349 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 349}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '1999-05-11', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Gabriel Garcia Marquez'], 'title': 'Of Love and Other Demons', 'isbn13': '9780517405093', 'msrp': 2.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0517405091', 'isbn10': '0517405091'}}
