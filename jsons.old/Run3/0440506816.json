{'book': {'publisher': 'Dell', 'synopsis': "The eight-year-old child is an exuberant, outgoing bundle of energy; he meets every challenge head-on, willing to try almost anything. Sometimes parents are amazed at the enthusiasm and excitement with which their child greets the world.<br/><br/>However, eight is also a time when the child begins to do a great deal of analyzing and evaluating, finding fault in himself and others--especially Mohter. How do parents help an eight-year-old through this up-and-down age? What should parents expect in their relationships with the child and how can life in the family be made easier? What will the child's relationship with friends and siblings be like? In the successful tradition of the Gesell institute series, Your Eight-Year-Old is a well-researched, highly accessible guide.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/12/9780440506812.jpg', 'title_long': 'Your Eight Year Old: Lively and Outgoing', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.29982867632 Pounds, Width: 0.35 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.35}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.29982867632}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.9}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '1990-03-01', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Child Psychology', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'School-Age Children', 'Parenting Boys', 'Parenting Girls', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology'], 'authors': ['Louise Bates Ames', 'Carol Chase Haber'], 'title': 'Your Eight Year Old: Lively and Outgoing', 'isbn13': '9780440506812', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307808963'}, 'isbn': '0440506816', 'isbn10': '0440506816', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307808967', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
