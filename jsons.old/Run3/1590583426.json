When farmer Carroll Calhoun refuses the archaeologists\' request to investigate an ancient Native American mound, Faye and her colleagues are disappointed. But his next action breaks their hearts: he tries to bulldoze the huge relic to the ground.<br/>Later Calhoun is found dead, his throat sliced with a handmade stone blade. Was he killed by an archaeologist angered by his wanton destruction of history? Did a Choctaw take up arms to defend an embattled heritage? Did someone decide to even the score with an old rival?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/25/9781590583425.jpg', 'title_long': 'Effigies (Faye Longchamp Mysteries, No. 3)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.86 Inches, Length: 5.78 Inches, Weight: 1.25002102554 Pounds, Width: 1.08 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.78}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.08}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.25002102554}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.86}}, 'pages': 301, 'date_published': '2007-01-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Native American', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Amateur Sleuths'], 'authors': ['Mary Anna Evans'], 'title': 'Effigies (Faye Longchamp Mysteries, No. 3)', 'isbn13': '9781590583425', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1590583426', 'isbn10': '1590583426'}}
