{'book': {'publisher': 'Ivan R. Dee', 'synopsis': 'A Hollywood millionaire with a terror of death, whose personal physician happens to be working on a theory of longevity-these are the elements of Aldous Huxley\'s caustic and entertaining satire on man\'s desire to live indefinitely. With his customary wit and intellectual sophistication, Huxley pursues his characters in their quest for the eternal, finishing on a note of horror. "This is Mr. Huxley\'s Hollywood novel, and you might expect it to be fantastic, extravagant, crazy and preposterous. It is all that, and heaven and hell too....It is the kind of novel that he is particularly the master of, where the most extraordinary and fortuitous events are followed by contemplative little essays on the meaning of life....The story is outrageously good."―New York Times. "A highly sensational plot that will keep astonishing you to practically the final sentence."―The New Yorker. "Mr. Huxley\'s elegant mockery, his cruel aptness of phrase, the revelations and the ingenious surprises he springs on the reader are those of a master craftsman; Mr. Huxley is at the top of his form." ―London Times Literary Supplement.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/84/9781566630184.jpg', 'title_long': 'After Many a Summer Dies the Swan', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.64 Inches, Length: 5.39 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.39}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.64}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '1993-01-01', 'subjects': ['Literary', 'General', 'FIC028000', 'cs.engls.liter'], 'authors': ['Aldous Huxley'], 'title': 'After Many a Summer Dies the Swan', 'isbn13': '9781566630184', 'msrp': 33.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1566630185', 'isbn10': '1566630185', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781461741350', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
