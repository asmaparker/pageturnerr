{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': "One of George Bernard Shaw's best-known plays, Pygmalion was a rousing success on the London and New York stages, an entertaining motion picture and a great hit with its musical version, My Fair Lady. An updated and considerably revised version of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, the 20th-century story pokes fun at the antiquated British class system.<br/>In Shaw's clever adaptation, Professor Henry Higgins, a linguistic expert, takes on a bet that he can transform an awkward cockney flower seller into a refined young lady simply by polishing her manners and changing the way she speaks. In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.<br/>The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw's brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made Pygmalion one of the most popular comedies in the English language. A staple of college drama courses, it is still widely performed.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/20/9780486282220.jpg', 'title_long': 'Pygmalion (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.18 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.18}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '1994-10-20', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'British & Irish'], 'authors': ['George Bernard Shaw'], 'title': 'Pygmalion (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)', 'isbn13': '9780486282220', 'msrp': 3, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0486113787', 'ePub': '0486113787'}, 'isbn': '0486282228', 'isbn10': '0486282228', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486113784', 'binding': 'fpid13alias'}]}}
