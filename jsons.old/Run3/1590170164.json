{'book': {'publisher': 'NYRB Classics', 'synopsis': "A bright star of the Italian Renaissance, Girolamo Cardano was an internationally-sought-after astrologer, physician, and natural philosopher, a creator of modern algebra, and the inventor of the universal joint. Condemned by the Inquisition to house arrest in his old age, Cardano wrote The Book of My Life, an unvarnished and often outrageous account of his character and conduct. Whether discussing his sex life or his diet, the plots of academic rivals or meetings with supernatural beings, or his deep sorrow when his beloved son was executed for murder, Cardano displays the same unbounded curiosity that made him a scientific pioneer. At once picaresque adventure and campus comedy, curriculum vitae, and last will, The Book of My Life is an extraordinary Renaissance self-portraitâ€”a book to set beside Montaigne's Essays and Benvenuto Cellini's Autobiography.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/68/9781590170168.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Book of My Life (New York Review Books Classics)', 'edition': 'Main', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.7054792384 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.85}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7054792384}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2002-10-31', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Europe', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Philosophers', 'Scientists', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods'], 'authors': ['Girolamo Cardano'], 'title': 'The Book of My Life (New York Review Books Classics)', 'isbn13': '9781590170168', 'msrp': 17.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1590170164', 'isbn10': '1590170164'}}
