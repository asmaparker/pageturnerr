{'book': {'publisher': 'Corgi Books', 'synopsis': '“The first of my father’s illusions was that bears could survive the life lived by human beings, and the second was that human beings could survive a life led in hotels.” So says John Berry, son of a hapless dreamer, brother to a cadre of eccentric siblings, and chronicler of the lives lived, the loves experienced, the deaths met, and the myriad strange and wonderful times encountered by the family Berry. Hoteliers, pet-bear owners, friends of Freud (the animal trainer and vaudevillian, that is), and playthings of mad fate, they “dream on” in a funny, sad, outrageous, and moving novel by the remarkable author of A Prayer for Owen Meany and Last Night in Twisted River.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/01/9780552120401.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Hotel New Hampshire (Export Ed)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.45415225972 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45415225972}}, 'pages': 427, 'date_published': '1982', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['John Irving'], 'title': 'The Hotel New Hampshire (Export Ed)', 'isbn13': '9780552120401', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0552120405', 'isbn10': '0552120405'}}
