{'book': {'publisher': 'Riverhead Books', 'synopsis': '“Whether you are interested in football or not, this is tears-running-down-your-face funny, read-bits-out-loud-to-complete-strangers funny, but also highly perceptive and honest about Hornby’s obsession and the state of the game.” —GQ<br/><br/>A brilliant memoir from the beloved, bestselling author of Dickens and Prince, Funny Girl, and High Fidelity.<br/><br/>In America, it is soccer. But in Great Britain, it is the real football. No pads, no prayers, no prisoners. And that’s before the players even take the field.<br/><br/>Nick Hornby has been a football fan since the moment he was conceived. Call it predestiny. Or call it preschool. Fever Pitch is his tribute to a lifelong obsession. Part autobiography, part comedy, part incisive analysis of insanity, Hornby’s award-winning memoir captures the fever pitch of fandom—its agony and ecstasy, its community, its defining role in thousands of young men’s coming-of-age stories. Fever Pitch is one for the home team. But above all, it is one for everyone who knows what it really means to have a losing season.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/82/9781573226882.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fever Pitch', 'edition': 'First Edition Thus', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.99 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.73}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.99}}, 'pages': 247, 'date_published': '1998-03-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'Memoirs', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Biographies', 'Soccer', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Nick Hornby'], 'title': 'Fever Pitch', 'isbn13': '9781573226882', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1440673047', 'ePub': '1440673047'}, 'isbn': '1573226882', 'isbn10': '1573226882', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781440673047', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
