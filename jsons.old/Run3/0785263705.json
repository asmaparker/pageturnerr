It is as if they are showing you the way. I used to not like God because God didn\'t resolve. But that was before any of this happened."<br/>Donald Miller was raised in a strict Texas denomination where he was only vaguely familiar with a distant God. When he grew older, he ran all the way to the least-religious university in the US: Rice College in Portland, Oregon. Still, God pursued him. When he came to know Jesus, he pursued the Christian life with great zeal. However, within a few years he had a successful ministry that ultimately left him feeling empty, burned out, and, once again, far away from God.<br/>In this intimate, non-judgmental, and soul-searching account, Miller describes his remarkable journey with and back to the infinitely loving God, helping you… discover how the Christian faith is still relevant in a postmodern culture; learn how to have a genuine encounter with a God who is real; and enjoy a renewed sense of passion for your life.<br/>Blue Like Jazz is a gentle, honest resource for those curious about the Christian faith, or new to it, and offers a fresh and original perspective on life, love, and redemption.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/08/9780785263708.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blue Like Jazz: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.49824471212 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49824471212}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2003-07-15', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Spiritual', 'Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Personal Growth', 'Spiritual Growth', 'Self Help', 'Ministry & Evangelism', 'Discipleship', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'Memoirs', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Donald Miller'], 'title': 'Blue Like Jazz: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality', 'isbn13': '9780785263708', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '141852994X', 'ePub': '141852994X'}, 'isbn': '0785263705', 'isbn10': '0785263705', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781418529949', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
