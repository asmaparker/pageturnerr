{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'An award-winning play from one of America’s most brilliant writers about a murder in a small Southern town, loosely based on the 1955 killing of Emmett Till. • "A play with fires of fury in its belly, tears of anguish in its eyes, a roar of protest in its throat." —The New York Times<br/><br/>James Baldwin turns a murder and its aftermath into an inquest in which even the most well-intentioned whites are implicated—and in which even a killer receives his share of compassion.<br/><br/>In a small Southern town, a white man murders a black man, then throws his body in the weeds. With this act of violence, James Baldwin launches an unsparing and at times agonizing probe of the wounds of race.<br/><br/>For where once a white storekeeper could have shot a "boy" like Richard Henry with impunity, times have changed. And centuries of brutality and fear, patronage and contempt, are about to erupt in a moment of truth as devastating as a shotgun blast.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/85/9780679761785.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blues for Mister Charlie: A Play', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.16 inches, Weight: 0.31305641204 Pounds, Width: 0.38 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.16}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.38}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.31305641204}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '1995-04-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Poetry', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['James Baldwin'], 'title': 'Blues for Mister Charlie: A Play', 'isbn13': '9780679761785', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0804149747'}, 'isbn': '0679761780', 'isbn10': '0679761780', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780804149747', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
