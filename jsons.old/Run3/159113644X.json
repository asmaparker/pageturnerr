INTELLIGENT AND THOUGHT PROVOKING ABOUT SO MUCH MORE THAN WAR. Suzy Davis, Ass\'t Professor of English-- Woosong University, South Korea,      Product Description      Frank Warz considers firefights blood sports he’d star in. A laborer in 1975 Detroit, he feels suckered into bypassing them for college. Finally, a necessary crime makes the antihero chase his guts-and-glory dreams. But the Foreign Legion rejects him. The devil, however, performs a miracle. The mixed blessing lets Warz follow the Legion to Djibouti to play soldier as a conflict photographer. After close calls enroute but no action, he finds the colony equally disappointing. Until a deserter’s trick leads to Warz’ coveted game. Only, it’s a last stand. “Do you ever feel the portfolio of your manhood should include combat?” William Hamilton, The New Yorker magazine, 2001 “It’s something a man needs to experience.” PFC Bennie Crouch, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, USA, enroute to Iraq, 2006      From the Inside Flap      Chapter 30\xa0 \xa0 \xa0Bang, thud, boom!\xa0Just like that, a mine went off and a flare whooshed upward from the no-man\'s land and popped open. Triple jeopardy.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0Colors were shocked off the spectrum and made a reverse negative of the whole scene. Legionnaires scattered for battle stations in a world that was now swaying under the rocking sky light. A ground flare hissed opposite running boots. The relief guard was caught midway on the ladder. Like a monkey on a stick, he shimmied to the top to hand crank his siren.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0Down the whole line, searchlights were snapped on. An explosion close by tried perforating Warz\' eardrums, and there was another blast, then another as legionnaires opened fire and splashed a half second of electric yellow-orange on everything spotlighted across from them in the perimeter.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0Armed shadows rushed past Warz to the fence. Ambush and alert teams hoping it was insurgents, hoping the assholes would try to take their lives to give them meaning. They were cursing in French, German, Czech, Portuguese, Polynesian.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0Warz had to see what was going on. Weaving from the jeep, he stumbled to a 10-foot-high chain-link fence and hung on it for balance.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0The new guard spotlighted the stage for him, and shaking there in a one-dimension scene bled of all color except black and white a lousy stone\'s throw from success were four gatecrashers stuck in a minefield. Two adults, two kids. A family. All around them, other people\'s admission charges dangled in the wire: flip-flops, hobo bags, pants, wrap-arounds, dresses.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0A stop team arrived', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/46/9781591136446.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Play Soldier', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.92153225516 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.73}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.92153225516}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 319, 'date_published': '2016-05-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'War', 'Action & Adventure', 'War & Military'], 'authors': ['Chet Green'], 'title': 'The Play Soldier', 'isbn13': '9781591136446', 'msrp': 17.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '159113644X', 'isbn10': '159113644X'}}
