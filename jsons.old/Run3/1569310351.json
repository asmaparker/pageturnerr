{'book': {'publisher': 'VIZ Media LLC', 'synopsis': "About the Author<br/><br/>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/59/9781569310359.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Return of Lum * Urusei Yatsura, Vol. 1', 'edition': 'Original', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '1995-06-05', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Comic Strips', 'Manga', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Rumiko Takahashi'], 'title': 'The Return of Lum * Urusei Yatsura, Vol. 1', 'isbn13': '9781569310359', 'msrp': 8.3, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1569310351', 'isbn10': '1569310351'}}
