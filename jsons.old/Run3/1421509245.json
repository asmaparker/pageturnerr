What common thread binds these three nations together? Answer: each is famous for producing unique, distinctive, delicious bread. But what about Japan, home to rice and delicacies of the sea? Is there not a doughy, gastronomic delight they can claim as their own? The answer is no...until now! Kazuma Azuma, a 16-year-old-boy blessed with otherworldly baking powers, has taken it upon himself to create Ja-pan, the national bread of the land of the rising sun!<br/><br/>The main competition in the Pantasia Rookie Tournament is finally over with Kazuma coming in first and pulling off a mind-blowing upset for Tsukino's South Tokyo Branch. But wait, what of Kazuma's rival/baking brother-in-arms Kawachi? Not content to simple sit on the sidelines, Kawachi challenges the dangerous and deadly Kai Suwabara for the third-place title. Suwabara claims that he can bake a French bread that's so good it literally dances. Can Kawachi counter Kai's terpsichorean treat with a loaf of bread that sings?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/42/9781421509242.jpg', 'title_long': 'Yakitate!!
