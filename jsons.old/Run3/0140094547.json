{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Books', 'synopsis': 'My Education is William S. Burroughs\'s final collection, first published two years before his death in 1997. It is a book of dreams, written over several decades and as personal and close to a memoir as we will see. The dreams cover themes from the mundane and ordinary -- conversations with his friends Allen Ginsberg or Ian Sommerville, feeding his cats, procuring drugs or sex -- to the erotic, bizarre, and visionary. Always a rich source of imagery in Burroughs\'s own fiction, in this book, dreams become a direct and powerful force in themselves.<br/><br/>"Mr. Burroughs has lost none of his irreverence or wit, but in recent years he has acquired an elegant, elegiac tone." â€“ The New York Times', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/41/9780140094541.jpg', 'title_long': 'My Education: A Book of Dreams', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.58 Inches, Length: 7.67 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.67}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.39}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.58}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1996-06-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Artists, Architects & Photographers', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['William S.
