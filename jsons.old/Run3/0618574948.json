{'book': {'publisher': 'Mariner Books', 'synopsis': 'The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien\'s three-volume epic, is set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth - home to many strange beings, and most notably hobbits, a peace-loving "little people," cheerful and shy. Since its original British publication in 1954-55, the saga has entranced readers of all ages. It is at once a classic myth and a modern fairy tale. Critic Michael Straight has hailed it as one of the "very few works of genius in recent literature." Middle-earth is a world receptive to poets, scholars, children, and all other people of good will. Donald Barr has described it as "a scrubbed morning world, and a ringing nightmare world...especially sunlit, and shadowed by perils very fundamental, of a peculiarly uncompounded darkness." The story of ths world is one of high and heroic adventure. Barr compared it to Beowulf, C.S. Lewis to Orlando Furioso, W.H. Auden to The Thirty-nine Steps. In fact the saga is sui generis - a triumph of imagination which springs to life within its own framework and on its own terms.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/40/9780618574940.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings (1)', 'edition': '28', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.35 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.35}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 544, 'date_published': '2005-06-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['J.R.R.
