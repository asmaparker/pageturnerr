{'book': {'publisher': 'BBC Books', 'synopsis': 'Though Sally Jupp came from the village home for unmarried mothers, she seemed the ideal girl to help Mrs Maxie run a large Elizabethan manor house and look after her invalid husband. But the real Sally, pretty, ambitious and clever, was very different from the docile, repentant character she seemed to be. Murder shattered the tranquillity of her new home and Chief Detective Inspector Adam Dalgliesh arrived in the peace of a country Sunday to solve a case as mysterious as Sally herself. He soon discovers that there is no shortage of motives, and as he investigates, the complex secrets and powerful passions of village and family life come into play. This BBC Radio dramatisation stars Robin Ellis, with Hugh Thomas Grant and Si√¢n Phillips.<br/>2 CDs. 2 hrs.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/72/9780563528272.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cover Her Face (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery, A BBC Radio Full-Cast Dramatization)', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.2314853751 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.2314853751}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}}, 'date_published': '2002-05-07', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Traditional Detectives'], 'authors': ['P.
