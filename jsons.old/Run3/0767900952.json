In The Heart's Code, Dr. Paul Pearsall explains the theory and science behind energy cardiology, the emerging field that is uncovering one of the most significant medical, social, and spiritual discoveries of our time: The heart is more than just a pump; it conducts the cellular symphony that is the very essence of our being.<br/><br/>Full of amazing anecdotes and data, The Heart's Code presents the latest research on cellular memory and the power of the heart's energy and explores what these breakthroughs mean about how we should live our lives. By unlocking the heart's code we can discover new ways of understanding human healing and consciousness and create a new model for living that leads to better health, happiness, and self-knowledge.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/59/9780767900959.jpg', 'title_long': "The Heart's Code: Tapping the Wisdom and Power of Our Heart Energy", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.21 Inches, Weight: 0.57540650382 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.21}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.57540650382}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.97}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '1999-04-06', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Alternative Medicine', 'Ayurveda', 'Healing', 'Diseases & Physical Ailments', 'Cancer', 'Heart Disease', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Chakras', 'Mental & Spiritual Healing', 'Occult & Paranormal'], 'authors': ['Paul Pearsall'], 'title': "The Heart's Code: Tapping the Wisdom and Power of Our Heart Energy", 'isbn13': '9780767900959', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0767900952', 'isbn10': '0767900952'}}
