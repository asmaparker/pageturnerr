{'book': {'publisher': 'Ivan R. Dee', 'synopsis': 'When Aldous Huxley\'s Brave New World first appeared in 1932, it presented in terms of purest fantasy a society bent on self-destruction. Few of its outraged critics anticipated the onset of another world war with its Holocaust and atomic ruin. In 1948, seeing that the probable shape of his anti-utopia had been altered inevitably by the facts of history, Huxley wrote Ape and Essence. In this savage novel, using the form of a film scenario, he transports us to the year 2108. The setting is Los Angeles where a "rediscovery expedition" from New Zealand is trying to make sense of what is left. From chief botanist Alfred Poole we learn, to our dismay, about the twenty-second-century way of life. "It was inevitable that Mr. Huxley should have written this book: one could almost have seen it since Hiroshima is the necessary sequel to Brave New World."―Alfred Kazin. "The book has a certain awesome impressiveness; its sheer intractable bitterness cannot but affect the reader."―Time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/83/9780929587783.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ape and Essence', 'edition': 2, 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.03 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Weight: 0.57 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.44}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.57}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.03}}, 'pages': 222, 'date_published': '1992-08-01', 'subjects': ['Literary', 'General', 'FIC028000', 'cs.engls.liter'], 'authors': ['Aldous Huxley'], 'title': 'Ape and Essence', 'isbn13': '9780929587783', 'msrp': 45.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0929587782', 'isbn10': '0929587782', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781461741367', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
