{'book': {'publisher': 'New Riders Publishing', 'synopsis': "The book begins with a briefing on Jakob's web usability principles, themselves culled from years of research. The 50 sites fall under such categories as Fortune 500 Sites, Highest-Traffic Sites, and E-Commerce Sites.<br/>The content is simply presented: Four book pages are devoted to each homepage. The first page is a clean screenshot of the site's homepage (for readers to make their own, unbiased judgments), followed by a page that explains the site's purpose and summarizes its success--or failure--at usabilty. The third and fourth pages are devoted to crtiques, where Jakob and Marie present no-holds-barred commentary for specific usability practices, as well as suggestions for improvement. Although only the homepage of each site is analyzed, many of the critiques can be applied to overall website design.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/20/9780735711020.jpg', 'title_long': 'Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.03935 Inches, Length: 9.96061 Inches, Weight: 2.52649752252 Pounds, Width: 0.74803 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.96061}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.74803}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.52649752252}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.03935}}, 'pages': 315, 'date_published': '2001-10', 'subjects': ['Computers & Technology', 'Web Development & Design', 'Web Design', 'Internet & Social Media', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Jakob Nielsen', 'Marie Tahir'], 'title': 'Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed', 'isbn13': '9780735711020', 'msrp': 32.57, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '073571102X', 'isbn10': '073571102X'}}
