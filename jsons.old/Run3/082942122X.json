{'book': {'publisher': 'Loyola Classics', 'synopsis': '“In Helena, the play of words and the fireworks, the exquisite descriptions of landscapes, and even the finished portraits of the heroine, her husband, and her son, are always subordinate to the author’s broad vision of the mixed anguish and hope with which the world of Constantine’s time was filled.”<br/>—New York Herald Tribune<br/>“[Helena] may be read on two levels of appreciation: As bright entertainment, or as deceptively profound commentary. On both levels it’s a superlatively well done book.”<br/>—Chicago Tribune<br/>Evelyn Waugh, author of the internationally acclaimed bestseller Brideshead Revisited and one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, considered Helena to be perhaps his finest novel. Based on the life of St. Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine and finder of the true cross, this spiritual adventure brings to life the political intrigues of ancient Rome and the early years of Christianity.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/24/9780829421224.jpg', 'title_long': 'Helena (Loyola Classics)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.000625 Pounds, Width: 0.63 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.63}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.000625}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 264, 'date_published': '2005-03-01', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical', 'Genre Fiction', 'Literary', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Evelyn Waugh', 'George Weigel'], 'title': 'Helena (Loyola Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780829421224', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '082942122X', 'isbn10': '082942122X'}}
