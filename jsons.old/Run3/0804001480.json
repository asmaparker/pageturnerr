{'book': {'publisher': 'Swallow Press', 'synopsis': 'With an introduction by Allison Pease, this new edition of House of Incest is a lyrical journey into the subconscious mind of one of the most celebrated feminist writers of the twentieth-century.<br/>Originally published in 1936, \u202fHouse of Incest \u202fis Anaïs Nin’s first work of fiction. Based on Nin’s dreams, the novel is a surrealistic look within the narrator’s subconscious as she attempts to distance herself from a series of all-consuming and often taboo desires she cannot bear to let go. The incest Nin depicts is a metaphor—a selfish love wherein a woman can appreciate only qualities in a lover that are similar to her own. Through a descriptive exploration of romances and attractions between women, between a sister and her beloved brother, and with a Christ-like man, Nin’s narrator discovers what she thinks is truth: that a woman’s most perfect love is of herself. At first, this self-love seems ideal because it is attainable without fear and risk of heartbreak. But in time, the narrator’s chosen isolation and self-possessed anguish give way to a visceral nightmare from which she is unable to wake.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/89/9780804001489.jpg', 'title_long': 'House Of Incest', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.375 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.375}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 72, 'date_published': '1991-02-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Anthologies', 'Regional & Cultural', 'United States'], 'authors': ['Anaïs Nin'], 'title': 'House Of Incest', 'isbn13': '9780804001489', 'msrp': 11.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0804001480', 'isbn10': '0804001480'}}
