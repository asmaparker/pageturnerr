{'book': {'publisher': 'Virago UK', 'synopsis': 'Fashion model, UN ambassador, and courageous spirit, Waris Dirie is a remarkable woman. Born into a family of tribal desert nomads in Somalia, she told her story in the worldwide bestseller Desert Flower: enduring female circumcision at the age of 5; running away through the desert at 12 to escape an arranged marriage; being discovered by photographer Terence Donovan as she worked as a cleaner in London; and becoming a top fashion model. Although she fled Somalia, she never forgot the country or the family that shaped her. Desert Dawn is Waris Dirie’s profoundly moving account of her return to her homeland. As an international model, Waris Dirie was the face of Revlon. In 1997, as part of its campaign to eliminate female genital mutilation, the United Nations appointed her Special Ambassador for Women’s Rights in Africa. She now lives in New York with her son.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/83/9781844080083.jpg', 'title_long': 'Desert Dawn', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.6 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.3968320716 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3968320716}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.6}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2004-06-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Law', 'Constitutional Law', 'Human Rights', 'Politics & Social Sciences', "Women's Studies", 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Waris Dirie', "Jeanne d'haem"], 'title': 'Desert Dawn', 'isbn13': '9781844080083', 'msrp': 10.86, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1844080080', 'isbn10': '1844080080'}}
