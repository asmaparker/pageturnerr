Through its ruins, bounty hunter Rick Deckard stalked, in search of the renegade replicants who were his prey. When he wasn't 'retiring' them with his laser weapon, he dreamed of owning a live animal - the ultimate status symbol in a world all but bereft of animal life. Then Rick got his chance: the assignment to kill six Nexus-6 targets, for a huge reward.

He wrote more than fifty books in a career of prodigious productivity and achievement. The films BLADE RUNNER and TOTAL RECALL were based on his stories.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/03/9780752864303.jpg', 'title_long': 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75589 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.4739938633 Pounds, Width: 0.66929 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.66929}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4739938633}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75589}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Philip K.
