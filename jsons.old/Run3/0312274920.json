In attempting to hitchhike round Ireland wich a fridge, Tony Hawks did both, and his foolhardiness led him to one of the best experiences of his life. Joined by his trusty traveling companion-cum-domestic appliance, he made his way from Dublin to Donegal, from Sligo through Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Cork, Wexford, Wicklow--and back again to Dublin. In their month of madness, Tony and his fridge met a real prince, a bogus king, and the fridge got christened. They surfed together, entered a bachelor festival, and one of them had sex without the other knowing. And unexpectedly, the fridge itself became a momentary focus for the people of Ireland.<br/><br/>An international bestseller, Round Ireland with a Fridge is a classic travel adventure in the tradition of Bill Bryson with a dash of Dave Barry.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/24/9780312274924.jpg', 'title_long': 'Round Ireland with a Fridge', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.1999836 Inches, Length: 5.55 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.55}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.1999836}}, 'pages': 264, 'date_published': '2001-03-07', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Travel', 'Europe', 'Ireland', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors': ['Tony Hawks'], 'title': 'Round Ireland with a Fridge', 'isbn13': '9780312274924', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0312274920', 'isbn10': '0312274920'}}
