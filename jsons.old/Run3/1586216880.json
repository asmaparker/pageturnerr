As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa\'s antiapartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is still revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality.<br/><br/>Long Walk to Freedom is his moving and exhilarating autobiography, destined to take its place among the finest memoirs of history\'s greatest figures.
