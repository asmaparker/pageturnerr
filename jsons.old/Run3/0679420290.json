{'book': {'publisher': "Everyman's Library", 'synopsis': "A masterpiece of guilt and redemption that transforms the sordid story of an old woman’s murder into the nineteenth century’s profoundest and most compelling philosophical novel. • ONE OF TIME MAGAZINE'S 100 BEST MYSTERY AND THRILLER BOOKS OF ALL TIME<br/><br/>Raskolnikov, an impoverished student living in the St. Petersburg of the tsars, is determined to overreach his humanity and assert his untrammeled individual will. When he commits an act of murder and theft, he sets into motion a story that, for its excruciating suspense, its atmospheric vividness, and its depth of characterization and vision is almost unequaled in the literatures of the world. The best known of Dostoevsky’s masterpieces, Crime and Punishment can bear any amount of rereading without losing a drop of its power over our imaginations.<br/><br/>Award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky render this elusive and wildly innovative novel with an energy, suppleness, and range of voice that do full justice to the genius of its creator.<br/><br/>Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket. Everyman’s Library Classics include an introduction, a select bibliography, and a chronology of the author's life and times.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/93/9780679420293.jpg', 'title_long': "Crime and Punishment (Everyman's Library)", 'edition': '12th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.27 Inches, Weight: 1.41 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.27}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.3}}, 'pages': 608, 'date_published': '1993-05-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Fyodor Dostoyevsky'], 'title': "Crime and Punishment (Everyman's Library)", 'isbn13': '9780679420293', 'msrp': 26, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '030782960X'}, 'isbn': '0679420290', 'isbn10': '0679420290', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307829603', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
