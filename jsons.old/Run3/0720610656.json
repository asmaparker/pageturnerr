{'book': {'publisher': 'Peter Owen Publishers', 'synopsis': 'In this brilliant adaptation of a novel by the 19th century Greek author Emmanuel Royidis, Lawrence Durrell traces the remarkable history of a young woman who travelled across Europe in the ninth century disguised as a monk, acquired great learning, and ruled over Christendom for two years as Pope John VIII before her sudden and surprising death.
