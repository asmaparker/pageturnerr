{'book': {'publisher': 'Free Press', 'synopsis': "Cassie Claiborne's world is riddled with problems beyond her control: her hard-living, pool-shooting father has another wife; her mother can't seem to move herself mentally away from the kitchen window; and her sister Belle is a tempest of fragility and brilliance. Frustrated by her inability to care for so many, Cassie finds in the local pool hall an oasis of green felt where she can master objects and restrain her emotions.<br/>As Cassie grows up, she takes on the thankless role of family provider by working odd jobs and hustling pool. All the while she keeps her eye on the ultimate prize: wringing suitable justice from past wrongs and freeing herself from her life's inertia. In this uplifting story, Haven Kimmel reaches deep into the hamstrung souls of her fictional corner of Indiana to create an astonishing work of pure heartbreak.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/71/9780743247771.jpg', 'title_long': 'Something Rising (Light and Swift): A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.82452885988 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.82452885988}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4375}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2005-04-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Haven Kimmel'], 'title': 'Something Rising (Light and Swift): A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780743247771', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1439105073', 'ePub': '1439105073'}, 'isbn': '0743247779', 'isbn10': '0743247779', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781439105078', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
