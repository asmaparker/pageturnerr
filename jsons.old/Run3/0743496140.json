{'book': {'publisher': 'Downtown Press', 'synopsis': "USA TODAY bestselling author of The Givenchy Code Julie Kenner reloads for her second novel of high-heeled thrills as another woman gets pulled into a mysterious world of extreme gaming where she must play or die.<br/><br/>Aspiring actress Jennifer Crane knows all about games—the games girls play to get a guy; the games actresses play to land a part; and the good old game of credit-card roulette. (How else is a girl supposed to afford her shoes?) But she never expected to be playing a game with life-or-death consequences. Unable to successfully score an acting gig, she has, instead, been cast in the role of reluctant bodyguard to a real-life assassin's target— a dashing FBI agent of all people!—and must embark with him upon a scavenger hunt across Manhattan in search of the ultimate prize: survival. Before this, Jenn's definition of fighting dirty has been elbowing her way to the front of the line at a Manolo sample sale. Now, if she wants to stay alive, she's going to have to learn a few new uses for her stilettos...and they ain't pretty.<br/><br/>Fast, flirty, and full of great footwear, The Manolo Matrix is another electrifying adventure in this breakout series for fashionistas who love a perfectly appointed mystery.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/48/9780743496148.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Manolo Matrix', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.9}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 337, 'date_published': '2006-02-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Julie Kenner'], 'title': 'The Manolo Matrix', 'isbn13': '9780743496148', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1416523278'}, 'isbn': '0743496140', 'isbn10': '0743496140', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416523277', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
