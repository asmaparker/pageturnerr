{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': "Arthur Schopenhauer's Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung is one of the most important philosophical works of the nineteenth century, the basic statement of one important stream of post-Kantian thought. It is without question Schopenhauer's greatest work. Conceived and published before the philosopher was 30 and expanded 25 years later, it is the summation of a lifetime of thought.<br/>For 70 years, the only unabridged English translation of this work was the Haldane-Kemp collaboration. In 1958, a new translation by E. F. J. Payne appeared that decisively supplanted the older one. Payne's translation is superior because it corrects nearly 1,000 errors and omissions in the Haldane-Kemp translation, and it is based on the definitive 1937 German edition of Schopenhauer's work prepared by Dr. Arthur HÃ¼bscher. Payne's edition is the first to translate into English the text's many quotations in half a dozen languages. It is thus the most useful edition for the student or teacher.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/11/9780486217611.jpg', 'title_long': 'The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1', 'edition': '58441st', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.7 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 694, 'date_published': '1966-06-01', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Free Will & Determinism', 'Metaphysics', 'Modern'], 'authors': ['Arthur Schopenhauer'], 'title': 'The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1', 'isbn13': '9780486217611', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0486132781', 'eBook': '0486132781', 'ePub': '0486132781'}, 'isbn': '0486217612', 'isbn10': '0486217612', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486132785', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
