{'book': {'publisher': 'National Geographic', 'synopsis': "From famous Bondi beach in Sydney to massive Ayers Rock in the remote desert Outback, from rough-and-tumble gold-mining towns in Australia's far west to the incredible underwater vistas of the Great Barrier Reef, long-time Oz resident Roff Smith guides you through the incredibly varied land- and cityscapes that is modern Australia. Illustrated with more than 250 vivid photographs and nearly 30 detailed, full-color maps, this guide gives you every tool you need to plan a trip to the unique land on the other side of the world. Starting with a detailed introduction to Australia's history, food, land, and culture-factors that have clearly shaped the distinctive character of the Australian people-the book explores every corner of the country starting with Sydney, the gleaming cosmopolitan jewel in New South Wales. Special sidebars give detailed information on many topics such as Australian wine, cricket, bush fires, Aborginal art, and the many cultural festivals of Southern Australia. In additional, the book features seven guided drives through some of the land's more spectacular scenery and numerous guided walks in Sydney and Melbourne. A thorough Travelwise section recommends hotels and restaurants throughout the country in all price ranges. Whether you're visiting the lush forests and wildflowers of the Snowy Mountains, fishing for trout in the rivers of Tasmania, or taking in a concert at Sydney's world-famous Opera House, this guide has everything needed for a memorable trip.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/35/9780792238935.jpg', 'title_long': 'National Geographic Traveler: Australia', 'edition': 'Updated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.29 Inches, Weight: 1.48591564588 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.29}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.87}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.48591564588}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2005-06-01', 'subjects': ['Travel', 'Australia & South Pacific', 'Australia', 'General', 'Reference', 'Specialty Travel', 'Tourist Destinations & Museums'], 'authors': ['Roff Smith'], 'title': 'National Geographic Traveler: Australia', 'isbn13': '9780792238935', 'msrp': 27.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0792238931', 'isbn10': '0792238931'}}
