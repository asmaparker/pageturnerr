Masterfully stoking public opinion, the movement's leaders pioneered a variety of techniques that have been adopted by citizens' movements ever since, from consumer boycotts to wall posters and lapel buttons to celebrity endorsements. A deft chronicle of this groundbreaking antislavery crusade and its powerful enemies, Bury the Chains gives a little-celebrated human rights watershed its due at last.<br/><br/>“Bury the Chains is by far the most readable and rounded account we have of British antislavery, a campaign that...helped to change the world and can be seen as a prototype of the modern social justice movement”—Los Angeles Times Book Review", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/78/9780618619078.jpg', 'title_long': "Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.28 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.28}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2006-02-10', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Europe', 'Great Britain', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'World', 'Slavery & Emancipation', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Race Relations'], 'authors': ['Adam Hochschild'], 'title': "Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves", 'isbn13': '9780618619078', 'msrp': 11.65, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0618619070', 'isbn10': '0618619070', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547526959', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
