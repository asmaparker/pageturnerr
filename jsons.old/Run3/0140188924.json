{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': '“A remarkable narrative of a worklife as told to Primo Levi, who is as great a listener as he is a creative artist.” —Studs Terkel<br/><br/>A Penguin Classic<br/><br/>In this exuberant and wildly funny novel, Primo Levi celebrates the joys of work and the art of storytelling. The magic is worked through the mesmerizing tales told by Libertini Faussone, a construction worker, and by the narrator, a writer-chemist, who share stories of their adventures. Faussone is a life-loving, self-educated philosopher who has built bridges and towers in India, Africa, Alaska, and Russia. His passion for work and travel shines through his stories—of a monkey who wanted to be a man, of a magnificent machine that caught stardust, and of a first love, a girl who drove a bulldozer. The writer-chemist, himself a rigger of words and molecules, listens, patient and amused, and responds with his own fascinating stories and reflections on the similar joys of labor, both physical and intellectual.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
