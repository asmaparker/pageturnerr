{'book': {'publisher': "Travelers' Tales", 'synopsis': 'The perfect trip, where nothing goes wrong, is surely not the memorable trip, which is where everything goes wrong and one lives to tell the tale \x97 and laugh about it. This collection captures the wackiest and most bizarre experiences of well-known writers whose travels have taken a detour. Stories include Nigel Barley escorting a monkey to the movies in Cameroon, Dave Barry vainly trying to learn more Japanese than how to order a beer, Alan Zweible high-tailing it to a nudist camp, Donna Marazzo bravely attempting to use a high-tech Italian toilet, and Richard Sterling feasting on deep-fried potato bugs in Burma. There are even practical tips here too; readers can surely learn from Mary Roach, who discovers that utilizing an Antarctic ice-sheet outhouse at the very moment a seal chooses to use its opening as a blowhole may not be the best way to start the day.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/78/9781932361278.jpg', 'title_long': "There's No Toilet Paper . . . on the Road Less Traveled: The Best of Travel Humor and Misadventure (Travelers' Tales Guides)", 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.04 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.40565056208 Pounds, Width: 0.47 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.24}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.47}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.40565056208}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.04}}, 'pages': 216, 'date_published': '2005-11-16', 'subjects': ['Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors': [], 'title': "There's No Toilet Paper . . . on the Road Less Traveled: The Best of Travel Humor and Misadventure (Travelers' Tales Guides)", 'isbn13': '9781932361278', 'msrp': 13.36, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1932361278', 'isbn10': '1932361278'}}
