{'book': {'publisher': 'Mariner Books', 'synopsis': 'From National Book Critics Circle Award finalist Rick Bass, Colter: The True Story of the Best Dog I Ever Had is "[a] gorgeous, heart-tugging, man-and-dog memoir" (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel).<br/><br/>Colter, a German shorthair pup, was the runt of the litter, and Rick Bass took him only because nobody else would. Soon, though, Colter surprised his new owner, first with his raging genius, then with his innocent ability to lead Bass to new territory altogether, a place where he felt instantly more alive and more connected to the world.<br/><br/>This interspecies love story vividly captures the essence of canine companionship, and yet, as we\'ve come to expect from Rick Bass, it does far more. Colter illuminates the heart of life by recreating the sheer, unmitigated pleasure of an afternoon in the Montana hills with a loyal pup bounding at your side.<br/><br/>"Colter is a dog of boundless spirit, all grace and wild genius. And his terrific master, Rick Bass, happens to be a national treasure. What a terrific team they make."—New York Times best-selling author Carl Hiaasen', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/68/9780618127368.jpg', 'title_long': 'Colter: The True Story of the Best Dog I Ever Had', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.34392112872 Pounds, Width: 0.505 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.505}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.34392112872}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2001-06-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Dogs', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Reference', 'Science & Math', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Nature Writing & Essays', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Rick Bass'], 'title': 'Colter: The True Story of the Best Dog I Ever Had', 'isbn13': '9780618127368', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0618127364', 'isbn10': '0618127364', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547526362', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
