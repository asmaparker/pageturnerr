{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House Trade Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "All Iain Levison really wants is a steady paycheck, cable television, and the possibility of a date on Saturday night. But after blowing $40,000 on an English degree, he can’t find the first, can’t afford the second, and can’t even imagine what woman would consent to the third. So he embarks on a time-honored American tradition: scoring a few dead-end jobs until something better comes along. The problem is, it never does.<br/><br/>A Working Stiff's Manifesto is a laugh-out-loud memoir of one man’s quest to stay afloat. From the North Carolina piedmont to the Alaskan waters, Levison’s odyssey takes him on a cross-country tour of wage labor: gofer, oil deliveryman, mover, fish cutter, restaurant manager, cable thief, each job more mind-numbing than the last. A Working Stiff's Manifesto will resonate with anyone who has ever suffered a demeaning job, worn a name badge, or felt the tyranny of the time clock.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/44/9780812967944.jpg', 'title_long': "A Working Stiff's Manifesto: A Memoir of Thirty Jobs I Quit, Nine That Fired Me, and Three I Can't Remember", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.11 Inches, Weight: 0.29 Pounds, Width: 0.38 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.11}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.38}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.29}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.95}}, 'pages': 164, 'date_published': '2003-04-08', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Business', 'Business & Money', 'Job Hunting & Careers', 'Guides', 'Economics', 'Labor & Industrial Relations', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Business & Professional', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Iain Levison'], 'title': "A Working Stiff's Manifesto: A Memoir of Thirty Jobs I Quit, Nine That Fired Me, and Three I Can't Remember", 'isbn13': '9780812967944', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0812967941', 'isbn10': '0812967941'}}
