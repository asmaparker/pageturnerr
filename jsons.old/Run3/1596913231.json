{'book': {'publisher': 'Bloomsbury USA', 'synopsis': "If Adam Gopnik's Paris to the Moon described daily life in contemporary Paris, this book describes daily life in Paris throughout its history: a history of the city from the point of view of the Parisians themselves. Paris captures everyone's imaginations: It's a backdrop for Proust's fictional pederast, Robert Doisneau's photographic kiss, and Edith Piaf's serenaded soldier-lovers; a home as much to romance and love poems as to prostitution and opium dens. The many pieces of the city coexist, each one as real as the next. What's more, the conflicted identity of the city is visible everywhere―between cobblestones, in bars, on the métro.<br/><br/>In this lively and lucid volume, Andrew Hussey brings to life the urchins and artists who've left their marks on the city, filling in the gaps of a history that affected the disenfranchised as much as the nobility. Paris: The Secret History ranges across centuries, movements, and cultural and political beliefs, from Napoleon's overcrowded cemeteries to Balzac's nocturnal flight from his debts. For Hussey, Paris is a city whose long and conflicted history continues to thrive and change. The book's is a picaresque journey through royal palaces, brothels, and sidewalk cafés, uncovering the rich, exotic, and often lurid history of the world's most beloved city.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/33/9781596913233.jpg', 'title_long': 'Paris: The Secret History', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.3751841 Inches, Weight: 2 Pounds, Width: 1.499997 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.3751841}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.499997}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2006-11-28', 'subjects': ['History', 'Europe', 'France'], 'authors': ['Andrew Hussey'], 'title': 'Paris: The Secret History', 'isbn13': '9781596913233', 'msrp': 32.5, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1596913231', 'isbn10': '1596913231'}}
