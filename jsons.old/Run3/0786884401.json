She asks: is our collective health in a state of decline? If so, how dire is this crisis and has the public health system itself contributed to it? Using riveting detail and finely-honed storytelling, exploring outbreaks around the world, Garrett exposes the underbelly of the world\'s globalization to find out if it can still be assumed that government can and will protect the people\'s health, or if that trust has been irrevocably broken.<br/><br/>"A frightening vision of the future and a deeply unsettling one . . . a sober, scary book that not only limns the dangers posed by emerging diseases but also raises serious questions about two centuries\' worth of Enlightenment beliefs in science and technology and progress." -- Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/07/9780786884407.jpg', 'title_long': 'Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.125 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 1.75047036028 Pounds, Width: 1.375 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.375}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.75047036028}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.125}}, 'pages': 768, 'date_published': '2001-08-15', 'subjects': ['History', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Medical Books', 'Administration & Medicine Economics', 'Health Care Delivery', 'Health Policy', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Public Affairs & Policy'], 'authors': ['Laurie Garrett'], 'title': 'Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health', 'isbn13': '9780786884407', 'msrp': 18.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0786884401', 'isbn10': '0786884401'}}
