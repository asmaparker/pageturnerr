An invitation for every woman who’s ever felt she isn’t godly enough, isn’t loving enough, isn’t doing enough.<br/><br/>“Easy to read, personal, and well-written with a message much more than surface deep. Joanna probed, challenged, and encouraged me to live day by day as Mary in a Martha world.”—Carole Mayhall, author of Come Walk with Me and Here I Am Again, Lord<br/><br/>The life of a woman today isn’t all that different from the lives of Mary and Martha in the New Testament. Like Mary, you long to sit at the Lord’s feet . . . but the daily demands of a busy world just won’t leave you alone. Like Martha, you love Jesus and really want to serve him . . . yet you struggle with weariness, resentment, and feelings of inadequacy.<br/><br/>Then comes Jesus, into the midst of your busy life, to extend the same invitation he issued long ago to the two sisters from Bethany. Tenderly, he invites you to choose “the better part”—a joyful life of intimacy with him that flows naturally into loving service.<br/><br/>With her fresh approach to the familiar Bible story, Joanna Weaver shows how all of us, Marys and Marthas alike, can draw closer to our Lord: deepening our devotion, strengthening our service, and doing both with less stress and greater joy.<br/><br/>This book includes a twelve-week Bible study for individual or group use. A Study Guide and a corresponding ten-session video series on DVD or online are available separately.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/89/9781578562589.jpg', 'title_long': 'Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World: Finding Intimacy With God in the Busyness of Life', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.98 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.68784225744 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.69}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.68784225744}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.98}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2000-07-18', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Catholicism', 'Self Help', 'Christian Living', "Women's Issues", 'Spiritual Growth', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Joanna Weaver'], 'title': 'Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World: Finding Intimacy With God in the Busyness of Life', 'isbn13': '9781578562589', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307569020'}, 'isbn': '1578562589', 'isbn10': '1578562589', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307569028', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
