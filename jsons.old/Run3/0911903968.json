{'book': {'publisher': 'Gemstone Publishing', 'synopsis': "Presenting by popular demand one of the most anticipated collections! The legendary artist Carl Barks created Scrooge McDuck and chronicled many of his most popular adventures. In addition to superb storytelling and wonderful entertainment, he left behind a character who was not only rich in his stories, but one for whom the stories themselves were rich. Modern master Don Rosa, beginning in 1994, undertook the task of recounting Uncle Scrooge's past in a serialized epic. The wonderful result of his efforts is now collected in trade paperback form by Gemstone Publishing as THE LIFE & TIMES OF SCROOGE McDUCK.A collection of the celebrated 12-part Eisner Award-winning series that details the life of the young Uncle Scrooge. The story was originally serialized in the United States in Uncle Scrooge comics. Now it has been collected in one all-encompassing popularly-priced volume.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/66/9780911903966.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Life And Times Of Scrooge McDuck', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.1 Inches, Length: 6.6 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.1}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2007-06-19', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Comic Strips', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Don Rosa'], 'title': 'The Life And Times Of Scrooge McDuck', 'isbn13': '9780911903966', 'msrp': 89.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0911903968', 'isbn10': '0911903968'}}
