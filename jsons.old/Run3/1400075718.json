{'book': {'publisher': 'Anchor', 'synopsis': 'Fans around the world adore the bestselling No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency series and its proprietor, Precious Ramotswe, Botswana’s premier lady detective. In this charming series, Mma Ramotswe—with help from her loyal associate, Grace Makutsi—navigates her cases and her personal life with wisdom, good humor, and the occasional cup of tea.<br/><br/>Life is good for Mma Ramotswe as she sets out with her usual resolve to solve people’s problems, heal their misfortunes, and untangle the mysteries that make life interesting. And life is never dull on Tlokweng Road. A new and rather too brusque advice columnist is appearing in the local paper. Then, a cobra is found in the offices of the No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency. Recently, the Mokolodi Game Preserve manager feels an infectious fear spreading among his workers, and a local doctor may be falsifying blood pressure readings. To further complicate matters, Grace Makutsi may have scared off her own fiancé. Mma Ramotswe, however, is always up to the challenge. And Blue Shoes and Happiness will not fail to entertain Alexander McCall Smith’s oldest fans and newest converts with its great wit, charm, and great good will.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/13/9781400075713.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blue Shoes and Happiness (No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Book 7)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.21 Inches, Weight: 0.4625 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.21}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4625}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2007-03-13', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Alexander McCall Smith'], 'title': 'Blue Shoes and Happiness (No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Book 7)', 'isbn13': '9781400075713', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1400075718', 'isbn10': '1400075718'}}
