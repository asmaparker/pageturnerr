{'book': {'publisher': "Michael O'Mara Books", 'synopsis': "Dickens was best known perhaps for his great novelsâ€”Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, and Bleak House to name a few. His characters are some of the best known throughout the world, but it is Dickens's wit and excellent sense of humor that makes these characters so enduring and which can also be seen in his private letters. The Wicked Wit of Charles Dickens is a fantastic collection of Dickens's most amusing and interesting witticisms.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/77/9781854790477.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wicked Wit of Charles Dickens (The Wicked Wit of series)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.8 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.44}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7495716908}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.8}}, 'pages': 162, 'date_published': '2003-04-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Reference', 'Quotations'], 'authors': ['Charles Dickens', 'Shelley Klein'], 'title': 'Wicked Wit of Charles Dickens (The Wicked Wit of series)', 'isbn13': '9781854790477', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1854790471', 'isbn10': '1854790471'}}
