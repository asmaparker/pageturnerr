{'book': {'publisher': 'Del Rey', 'synopsis': 'In The Mirror of Her Dreams, the dazzling first volume of Mordant’s Need, New York Times bestselling author Stephen R. Donaldson introduced us to the richly imagined world of Mordant, where mirrors are magical portals into places of beauty and terror. Now, with A Man Rides Through, Donaldson brings the story of Terisa Morgan to an unforgettable conclusion. . . .<br/><br/>Aided by the powerful magic of Vagel, the evil Arch-Imager, the merciless armies are marching against the kingdom of Mordant. In its hour of greatest need, two unlikely champions emerge. One is Geraden, whose inability to master the simplest skills of Imagery has made him a laughingstock. The other is Terisa Morgan, transferred to Mordant from a Manhattan apartment by Geraden’s faulty magic. Together, Geraden and Terisa discover undreamed-of talents within themselves—talents that make them more than a match for any Imager . . . including Vagel himself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those talents also mark them for death. Branded as traitors, they are forced to flee the castle for their lives. Now, all but defenseless in a war-torn countryside ravaged by the vilest horrors Imagery can spawn, Geraden and Terisa must put aside past failures and find the courage to embrace their powers—and their love—before Vagel can spring his final trap.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/48/9780345459848.jpg', 'title_long': "A Man Rides Through (Mordant's Need, Book 2)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.3 Inches, Length: 6.06 Inches, Weight: 2.1 Pounds, Width: 1.44 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.06}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.44}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.3}}, 'pages': 661, 'date_published': '2003-06-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Romance', 'War & Military', 'United States', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Romantic'], 'authors': ['Stephen R.
