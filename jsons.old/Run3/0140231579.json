Gloria's image seems distilled from memory and fantasy and the fragments of whatever Jimmy can buy from the other sex workers: their sex, their stories—all the unavailing dreams of love and salvation among the drinkers and addicts who haunt San Francisco's Tenderloin District.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/71/9780140231571.jpg', 'title_long': 'Whores for Gloria: A Novel (Contemporary American Fiction)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.48 Inches, Length: 7.79 Inches, Weight: 0.31 Pounds, Width: 5.03 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.03}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.31}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.48}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '1994-02-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['William T.
