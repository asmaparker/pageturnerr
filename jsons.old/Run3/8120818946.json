After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Sri Yogananda was initiated into "sannyas" by his guru Sri Sri Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri. Sri Yukteswar had foretold that his life\'s mission was to spread throughout the world India\'s ancient meditation technique of "Kriya Yoga". Sri Yogananda accepted an invitation in 1920 to serve as India\'s delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston, USA. Paramahansa Yoganda founded Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship as the channel for the dissemination of his teachings. Through his writings and extensive lecture tours in India, America and Europe he introduced thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Paramahansaji entered "mahasamadhi" on March the 7th, 1952 in Los Angeles.
