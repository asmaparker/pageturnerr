He has returned from the far North where he tells of strange sights-a beautiful city hovering in the sky above the pole, a shimmering Dust that settles on and delineates all but human children. Lyra is scarcely able to save his life before Lord Asriel is off again, on a quest to answer the riddle of the world. Meanwhile, children are disappearing, and when Lyra's dearest friend is taken by the Gobblers, she determines to save him - a decision which leads her on a great journey, a journey that will lead to the discovery of her mother, a disastrous betrayal and the beginning of the unravelling of the mystery of Dust.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/25/9780439994125.jpg', 'title_long': 'Northern Lights: Adult Edition (His Dark Materials S.)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Weight: 0.75398093604 Pounds, Width: 0.98425 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1181}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.98425}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75398093604}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Philip Pullman'], 'title': 'Northern Lights: Adult Edition (His Dark Materials S.)', 'isbn13': '9780439994125', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0439994128', 'isbn10': '0439994128'}}
