{'book': {'publisher': 'Bethlehem Books', 'synopsis': 'Lisa, who tells the story, lives on Middle Farm with her parents and two brothers. Britta and Anna live at North Farm and Olaf and Kerstin live at South Farm. It is because the houses are right next door to each other and because the children make so much racket that the farmhouses came to be so honestly and happily named. A large linden tree grows between Middle and South Farms and so the boys in the two houses visit each other by climbing through the branchesâ€”even the girls do it sometimes, like the night they all waited for Olaf to go to sleep so that they could pull out his loose tooth without his knowing it! That is only one of the many escapades designed to make readers young and old wish they could step right into the pages of this little book. Join the fun in this companion volume to The Children of Noisy Village. Illustrated with delightful line drawings by Ilon Wikland; translated by Florence Lamborn.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/69/9781883937669.jpg', 'title_long': 'Happy Times in Noisy Village', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2003-07-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Astrid Lindgren', 'Ilon Wikland', 'Florence Lamborn'], 'title': 'Happy Times in Noisy Village', 'isbn13': '9781883937669', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1883937663', 'isbn10': '1883937663'}}
