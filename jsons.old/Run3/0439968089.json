{'book': {'publisher': 'Hippo/Scholastic', 'synopsis': 'A brand new hardback from Tamora Pierce. Alianne has an oppressive heritage. She is the daughter of Alanna, Lady Knight and King\'s Champion - the foremost warrior of Tortall. (See "Song of the Lioness".) Aly is not a fighter - she hates her mother\'s obsession, which constantly takes her away from her family and makes her children feel neglected and resentful - especially Aly. After a stormy argument with her mother, Aly runs away to make them sorry. But she gets more than she bargained for when she is kidnapped by pirates, and sold as a slave in the far-off Copper Isles. Aly\'s future is bleak, but then she finds out that this has all been planned, by a god, no less. Aly is a favourite of the god Kyprioth - she is the Trickster\'s Choice.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/89/9780439968089.jpg', 'title_long': "Trickster's Choice", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.07085 Inches, Length: 5.31495 Inches, Width: 0.74803 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31495}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.74803}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.07085}}, 'pages': 464, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors': ['Tamora Pierce'], 'title': "Trickster's Choice", 'isbn13': '9780439968089', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0439968089', 'isbn10': '0439968089'}}
