{'book': {'publisher': 'Running Press', 'synopsis': 'This graphic collection gathers the work of more than thirty artists who represent both the extreme edge of the comic art and its future. They are radical voices for the 21st century. Included are artists such as Peter Kuper, a frequent contributor to Time magazine, The New Yorker, The Village Voice, and The New York Times (where he had the first and only comic strip to run regularly in that paper); Eric Drooker, author/artist of the award-winning Flood! A Novel in Pictures: James Romberger, whose work is in the permanent collection of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art; and Mike Diana, famous now as the first cartoonist in U.S. history sentenced to jail as a result of his work. Here, politics is mixed with the personal. Stories range from Sandy Jiminez\'s tale of homophobia in the Latin community to Sabrina Jones\'s articulate defense of her right to have an abortion, from Seth Tobocman\'s account of the squatters\' movement on New York\'s Lower East Side to a piece by Mumia Abu Jamal commenting on the "three strikes" judiciary guidelines.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/95/9781568580395.jpg', 'title_long': 'World War 3 Illustrated: Confrontational Comics', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 1.3999353637 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3999353637}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '1995-10-17', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'History & Criticism', 'Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Anthologies'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'World War 3 Illustrated: Confrontational Comics', 'isbn13': '9781568580395', 'msrp': 9.81, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1568580398', 'isbn10': '1568580398'}}
