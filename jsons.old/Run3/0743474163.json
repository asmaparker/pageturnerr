{'book': {'publisher': 'Pocket Books', 'synopsis': "Corporate raider Matthew Farrell had come a long way from the poor, scruffy kid of Indiana's steel mills. A long way from the country club where, feeling like an outsider, he had dared to fall in love with a beautiful blonde named Meredith Bancroft, and known a once-in-a-lifetime passion and betrayal that still haunted his memory... Now world leaders courted him, the media watched his every move, and he was ready to move in on the Bancroft empire.<br/><br/>A cool, poised executive in her family's legendary department store chain, Meredith had once defied her father for the sexually magnetic, intense Matt Farrell -- and their brief, ill-fated marriage was the disastrous outcome. Now, as the Bancroft firm is threatened by a hostile takeover, Meredith is forced to confront Matt. As tensions build between them, bittersweet memories rise to the surface, leaving them suspicious, restless, and uncertain. Will they be able to believe in each other -- and grasp the tender miracle that is before them?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/60/9780743474160.jpg', 'title_long': 'Paradise', 'edition': 'Later Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 709, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Judith McNaught'], 'title': 'Paradise', 'isbn13': '9780743474160', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0743474163', 'isbn10': '0743474163'}}
