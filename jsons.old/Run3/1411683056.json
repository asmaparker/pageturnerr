{'book': {'publisher': 'Lulu.Com', 'synopsis': 'Moscow, 1929: a city that has lost its way amid corruption and fear, inhabited by people who have abandoned their morals and forsaken spirituality. But when a mysterious stranger arrives in town with a bizarre entourage that includes a giant talking cat and a fanged assassin, all hell breaks loose. Among those caught up in the strange and inexplicable events that transpire in the capital are the Master, a writer whose life has been destroyed by Soviet repression, and his beloved Margarita. Their adventures reveal a story that began two thousand years ago in ancient Jerusalem - and its resolution will decide their fate.<br/><br/>Considered one of the finest creations of Russian literature in the 20th century, The Master and Margarita is an amazing work of fantasy, a love story, a biting satire on Soviet life, and a lot more. Mikhail Bulgakov\x92s last book and crowning achievement, it has been written in secrecy, burned and restored, and banned for decades. Its author, who worked on it until his final days, never saw it in print. This new translation faithfully reproduces the style and idiomatic flow of the text, so that the English-speaking audience may fully enjoy Bulgakov\x92s masterpiece.<br/><br/>Includes annotations and commentary.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/51/9781411683051.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Master And Margarita', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.07806046118 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.07806046118}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 332, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['Mikhail Bulgakov'], 'title': 'The Master And Margarita', 'isbn13': '9781411683051', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1411683056', 'isbn10': '1411683056'}}
