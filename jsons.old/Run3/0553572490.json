She had already begun the week as a bride...and ended it as a murderess. She was sure no one would believe that she'd hit her elderly groom with a bed warmer and knocked him dead quite by accident. So she did the only thing she could--she ran. Yet now she was in no<br/>position to turn down a shocking proposition from the dangerously handsome Duke of Redmayne: that she become one man's wife and another man's mistress--his mistress.<br/><br/>Could she play such a role? Could she live up to such a bargain? And once she had tasted the pleasures of Redmayne's bed, would she ever want anything else?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/90/9780553572490.jpg', 'title_long': "Vice (Jane Feather's V Series)", 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.85 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.50044874 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044874}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.85}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '1996-05-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Action & Adventure'], 'authors': ['Jane Feather'], 'title': "Vice (Jane Feather's V Series)", 'isbn13': '9780553572490', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307431002', 'ePub': '0307431002'}, 'isbn': '0553572490', 'isbn10': '0553572490', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307431004', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
