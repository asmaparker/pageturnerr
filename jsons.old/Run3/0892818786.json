{'book': {'publisher': 'Healing Arts Press', 'synopsis': "Introduce children to the magic of using herbs for healing, cooking, and nature crafts and inspire a lifelong interest in the natural world.<br/><br/>• Designed especially for children ages five to ten.<br/><br/>• A hands-on book for children, filled with fun, easy-to-follow activities.<br/><br/>Walking the World in Wonder covers the medicinal and magical uses of sixty-seven common herbs. Each herb playfully introduces itself and talks about its habitat and many uses. With fun, easy-to-follow activities, herbalist Ellen Evert Hopman teaches children basic herbal skills and invites them to make a sunflower seed mosaic, sew a catnip-filled mouse, and dig for Jerusalem artichoke roots. The book also includes simple recipes that children can use, with adult supervision, to treat minor ailments--peppermint tea to soothe a troubled tummy or horse chestnut salve to heal a scraped knee. Children gain a sense of self-sufficiency and awe for the earth's treasures by eating wild nettle greens, sprinkling a sandwich with nasturtium flowers, making strawberry honey, and learning to season food with dill they've gathered themselves. Parents and teachers will appreciate how these earth-centered activities are placed within a broader social and environmental context. Sixty-seven full-color photographs enable children, parents, and teachers to identify these herbs during walks and field trips. Walking the World in Wonder gives children a direct and joyous experience of their connection to the natural world and inspires a lifelong interest in their own health and that of the planet.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/85/9780892818785.jpg', 'title_long': "Walking the World in Wonder: A Children's Herbal", 'edition': 'Original ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 0.00220462262 Pounds, Width: 0.2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.00220462262}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2000-11', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Health', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Activities, Crafts & Games', 'Activity Books', 'Games'], 'authors': ['Ellen Evert Hopman'], 'title': "Walking the World in Wonder: A Children's Herbal", 'isbn13': '9780892818785', 'msrp': 13.85, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1594775419'}, 'isbn': '0892818786', 'isbn10': '0892818786', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781594775413', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
