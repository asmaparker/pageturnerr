Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our “two minds”—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny. But why is emotional intelligence important?<br/><br/>Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart—and they aren’t fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood—with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work.<br/><br/>The twenty-fifth-anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence could not come at a better time—we spend so much of our time online, more and more jobs are becoming automated and digitized, and our children are picking up new technology faster than we ever imagined. With a new introduction from the author, the twenty-fifth-anniversary edition prepares readers, now more than ever, to reach their fullest potential and stand out from the pack with the help of EI.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/11/9780553804911.jpg', 'title_long': 'Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.51 Inches, Length: 6.38 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.38}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.13}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.51}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2006-09-26', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Success', 'Emotions', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cognitive Psychology'], 'authors': ['Daniel Goleman'], 'title': 'Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ', 'isbn13': '9780553804911', 'msrp': 29, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0553903209', 'ePub': '0553903209'}, 'isbn': '055380491X', 'isbn10': '055380491X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780553903201', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
