{'book': {'publisher': 'Drawn and Quarterly', 'synopsis': "Acclaimed cartoonist Chris Ware reveals the outtakes of his genius in these intimate, imaginative, and whimsical sketches collected from the years during which he completed his award-winning graphic novel Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth (Pantheon). His novel not only won the Manchester Guardian First Novel prize in 2001 but it has sold over 100,000 copies. This book is as much a companion volume to Jimmy Corrigan --one of the great crossover success stories-- as a tremendous art collection from of one of America's most interesting and popular graphic artist.<br/><br/>Chris Ware has a passion for drawing that is surprisingly wide-ranging in style and subject. This book surprises the reader on every page with its sense of spontaneous vision. Architectural drawings from Chicago and interplanetary robot comics collide with cruelly doodled human figures and quietly troubling studies of the still life. A must for people with a passion for modern design and old-fashioned style.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/69/9781896597669.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Acme Novelty Date Book: Sketches and Diary Pages in Facsimile', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5700596 Inches, Length: 6.9799073 Inches, Weight: 1.99959271634 Pounds, Width: 1.1901551 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.9799073}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1901551}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.99959271634}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5700596}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2003-08', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Individual Artists', 'Collections, Catalogs & Exhibitions', 'Drawing', 'Graphic Design', 'Techniques', 'Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Literary', 'Publishers', 'Drawn and Quarterly', 'How To Create Comics & Manga', 'Art of Comics and Manga'], 'authors': ['Chris Ware'], 'title': 'The Acme Novelty Date Book: Sketches and Diary Pages in Facsimile', 'isbn13': '9781896597669', 'msrp': 44.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1896597661', 'isbn10': '1896597661'}}
