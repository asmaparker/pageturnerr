{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House Childrens Books', 'synopsis': 'The New York Times bestselling chronicle of one of the most famous moments in American military history--the raising of the U. S. flag at Iwo Jima during World War II--now adapted for young adults. Read the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and strength of America and its armed forces.<br/><br/>This is a penetrating, epic look at a generation at war, told with keen insight and enormous honesty —also a major motion picture directed by Clint Eastwood. In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima–and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire, they battled to the island’s highest peak. And there, they raised a flag, signaling a historic step towards the eventual defeat of the Axis powers of World War II.<br/><br/>A powerful account of six very different men--three of which were killed in battle-- who came together in the heroic fight for the Pacific’s most crucial island. It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the legacy of a hero, and the brutal cost of war.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/09/9780440229209.jpg', 'title_long': 'Flags of Our Fathers', 'edition': 'Standard Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.26 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.26}}, 'pages': 211, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'Military', 'World War II'], 'authors': ['james-bradley-ron-powers-michael-french'], 'title': 'Flags of Our Fathers', 'isbn13': '9780440229209', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0440229200', 'isbn10': '0440229200'}}
