{'book': {'publisher': 'Hyperion', 'synopsis': 'Based on the longest-running one-man show in San Francisco history -- now coming to Off-Broadway -- a hilarious, poignant, and disarming memoir of growing up black in an all-white suburb<br/>In 1972, when Brian Copeland was eight, his family moved from Oakland to San Leandro, California, hoping for a better life. At the time, San Leandro was 99.4 percent white, known nationwide as a racist enclave. This reputation was confirmed almost immediately: Brian got his first look at the inside of a cop car, for being a black kid walking to the park with a baseball bat.<br/>Brian grew up to be a successful comedian and radio talk show host, but racism reemerged as an issue -- only in reverse -- when he received an anonymous letter: "As an African American, I am disgusted every time I hear your voice because YOU are not a genuine Black man!" That letter inspired Copeland to revisit his difficult childhood, resulting in a hit one-man show that has been running for nearly two years -- which has now inspired a book. In this funny, surprising, and ultimately moving memoir, Copeland shows exactly how our surroundings make us who we are.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/37/9781401302337.jpg', 'title_long': 'Not a Genuine Black Man: Or, How I Claimed My Piece of Ground in the Lily-White Suburbs', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.5 Inches, Length: 9.5 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2006-07-11', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Lawyers & Judges', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'United States', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Race Relations'], 'authors': ['Brian Copeland'], 'title': 'Not a Genuine Black Man: Or, How I Claimed My Piece of Ground in the Lily-White Suburbs', 'isbn13': '9781401302337', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '1401385699'}, 'isbn': '1401302335', 'isbn10': '1401302335', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781401385699', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
