Burroughs, his travels, love affairs, and literary apprenticeships.<br/><br/>At once fascinating reading and a major addition to Kerouac scholarship, here is a rare portrait of the writer as a young adventurer of immense talent, energy, and ambition in the midst of writing and living an American legend.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/42/9780140234442.jpg', 'title_long': 'Jack Kerouac: Selected Letters, Vol. 1, 1940-1956', 'edition': 'First Thus', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.43 Inches, Length: 8.11 Inches, Weight: 1.13758527192 Pounds, Width: 4.86 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.11}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.86}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.13758527192}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.43}}, 'pages': 656, 'date_published': '1996-03-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Letters', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jack Kerouac'], 'title': 'Jack Kerouac: Selected Letters, Vol. 1, 1940-1956', 'isbn13': '9780140234442', 'msrp': 25, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0140234446', 'isbn10': '0140234446'}}
