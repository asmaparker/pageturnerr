{'book': {'publisher': 'Schocken', 'synopsis': 'The Trial of God (as it was held on February 25, 1649, in Shamgorod)<br/>A Play by Elie Wiesel<br/>Translated by Marion Wiesel<br/>Introduction by Robert McAfee Brown<br/>Afterword by Matthew Fox<br/><br/>Where is God when innocent human beings suffer? This drama lays bare the most vexing questions confronting the moral imagination.<br/><br/>Set in a Ukranian village in the year 1649, this haunting play takes place in the aftermath of a pogrom. Only two Jews, Berish the innkeeper and his daughter Hannah, have survived the brutal Cossack raids. When three itinerant actors arrive in town to perform a Purim play, Berish demands that they stage a mock trial of God instead, indicting Him for His silence in the face of evil. Berish, a latter-day Job, is ready to take on the role of prosecutor. But who will defend God? A mysterious stranger named Sam, who seems oddly familiar to everyone present, shows up just in time to volunteer.<br/><br/>The idea for this play came from an event that Elie Wiesel witnessed as a boy in Auschwitz: “Three rabbis—all erudite and pious men—decided one evening to indict God for allowing His children to be massacred. I remember: I was there, and I felt like crying. But there nobody cried.”<br/><br/>Inspired and challenged by this play, Christian theologians Robert McAfee Brown and Matthew Fox, in a new Introduction and Afterword, join Elie Wiesel in the search for faith in a world where God is silent.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/38/9780805210538.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Trial of God: (as it was held on February 25, 1649, in Shamgorod)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.17 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.17}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.58}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044933474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.96}}, 'pages': 177, 'date_published': '1995-11-14', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Catholicism', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Literary', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Elie Wiesel'], 'title': 'The Trial of God: (as it was held on February 25, 1649, in Shamgorod)', 'isbn13': '9780805210538', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '030783381X'}, 'isbn': '0805210539', 'isbn10': '0805210539', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307833815', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
