{'book': {'publisher': 'Ivy Books', 'synopsis': "Patty Jane Dobbin should have known better than to marry a man as gorgeous as Thor Rolvaag, but she was too smitten to think twice. Yet nine months into their marriage, with a baby on the way, Thor is gone. It's a good thing Patty Jane has her irrepressible sister, Harriet, to rely on. For it's been said that a fine haircut can cure any number of ills, and before long the Minnesota sisters have opened a neighborhood beauty parlor complete with live harp music and an endless supply of delicious Norwegian baked goods. It's a wonderful, warmhearted place where you can count on good friends, lots of laughter, tears, and comfort when you need it--and the unmistakable scent of somebody getting a permanent wave. . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/08/9780804114608.jpg', 'title_long': "Patty Jane's House of Curl", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.84 Inches, Length: 4.17 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.17}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.82}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.84}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '1999-06-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Psychological', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Lorna Landvik'], 'title': "Patty Jane's House of Curl", 'isbn13': '9780804114608', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0804114609', 'isbn10': '0804114609'}}
