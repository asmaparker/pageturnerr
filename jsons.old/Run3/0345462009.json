Essential for Pern fans of all ages.”—Library Journal (starred review)<br/><br/>The son of a miner, Kindan has no expectations for any other life. He loves his lessons with the camp’s harper, but music isn’t part of a miner’s future. He also enjoys helping out with the camp’s watch-wher— a creature distantly related to dragons and uniquely suited to work in dark, cold spaces—but even that important job can’t promise a future above the ground. Then disaster strikes. In one terrible instant, Kindan loses his family and the camp loses its watch-wher. It will take a new friendship and a new responsibility to teach Kindan that even a seemingly impossible dream is never out of reach . . . and that light can be found in the deepest darkness.<br/><br/>“A guaranteed pleaser [in] one of SF’s most splendid and longest-lived sagas.”—Booklist<br/><br/>“Another delightful entry in the Pern series.”—Publishers Weekly', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/08/9780345462008.jpg', 'title_long': "Dragon's Kin (The Dragonriders of Pern)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.7 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.7}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2004-12-28', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Historical', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera'], 'authors': ['Anne McCaffrey', 'Todd J.
