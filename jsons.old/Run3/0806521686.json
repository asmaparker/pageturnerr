{'book': {'publisher': 'Citadel Pr', 'synopsis': 'In the world of The Minority Report, Commissioner John Anderton is the one to thank for the lack of crime. He is the originator of the Precrime System, which uses "precogs" - people with the power to see into the future - to identify criminals before they can do any harm. Unfortunately for Anderton, his precogs perceive him as the next criminal. But Anderton knows he has never contemplated such a thing, and this knowledge proves the precogs are fallible. Now, whichever way he turns, Anderton is doomed - unless he can find the precogs\'s "minority report" - the dissenting voice that represents his one hope of getting at the truth in time to save himself from his own system.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/88/9780806521688.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Minority Report: 18 Classic Stories by Philip K.
