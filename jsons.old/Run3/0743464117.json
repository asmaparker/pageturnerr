{'book': {'publisher': 'Pocket', 'synopsis': "On the bloody battlefields of World War II Europe, Easy Company, 506th Airborne Division, U.S. Army, got the toughest missions. As good a rifle company as any in the world, Easy was always in the thick of the fight -- from parachuting into France under a hellish crossfire early D-Day morning, to the final capture of Hitler's supposedly impregnable Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden. New York Times bestselling author Stephen E. Ambrose tells of the men in this brave unit who fought, went hungry, froze, and died for their country, and for one another -- taking 150 percent casualties and earning Purple Hearts as combat pay. Drawing on interviews with survivors as well as the soldiers' journals and letters, Ambrose chronicles the gripping true stories of these American heroes.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/16/9780743464116.jpg', 'title_long': "Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest", 'edition': 'Mass Paperback Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.5 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 480, 'date_published': '2002-08-27', 'subjects': ['History', 'Military', 'Aviation', 'United States', 'World War II', 'Regiments'], 'authors': ['Stephen E.
