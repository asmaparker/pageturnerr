{'book': {'publisher': 'Crown', 'synopsis': 'From the acclaimed author of Shackling Water comes the first great race novel of the twenty-first century, an incendiary and ruthlessly funny satire about violence, pop culture, and American identity.<br/><br/>Macon Detornay is a suburban white boy possessed and politicized by black culture, and filled with rage toward white America. After moving to New York City for college, Macon begins robbing white passengers in his taxicab, setting off a manhunt for the black man presumed to be committing the crimes. When his true identity is revealed, Macon finds himself to be a celebrity and makes use of the spotlight to hold forth on the evils and invisibility of whiteness. Soon he launches the Race Traitor Project, a stress-addled collective that attracts guilty liberals, wannabe gangstas, and bandwagon riders from all over the country to participate in a Day of Apologyâ€”a day set aside for white people to make amends for four hundred years of oppression. The Day of Apology pushes New York City over the edge into an epic riot, forcing Macon to confront the depth of his own commitment to the struggle.<br/><br/>Peopled with all manner of race pimps and players, Angry Black White Boy is a stunning breakout book from a critically acclaimed young writer and should be required reading for anyone who wants to get under the skin of the complexities of identity in America.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/79/9781400054879.jpg', 'title_long': 'Angry Black White Boy: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.94 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.15}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.81}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.94}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2005-03-08', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Miscellaneous', 'Journalism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Adam Mansbach'], 'title': 'Angry Black White Boy: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9781400054879', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307419797'}, 'isbn': '1400054877', 'isbn10': '1400054877', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307419798', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
