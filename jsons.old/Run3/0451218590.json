In the same way, audiences and critics alike could not get enough of Edward Albee’s masterful play. A dark comedy, it portrays husband and wife George and Martha in a searing night of dangerous fun and games. By the evening’s end, a stunning, almost unbearable revelation provides a climax that has shocked audiences for years. With its razor-sharp dialogue and the stripping away of social pretense, Newsweek rightly foresaw Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as “a brilliantly original work of art—an excoriating theatrical experience, surging with shocks of recognition and dramatic fire [that] will be igniting Broadway for some time to come.”", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/99/9780451218599.jpg', 'title_long': "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Revised by the Author", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2006-08-01', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'History & Criticism', 'Genres & Styles', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Edward Albee'], 'title': "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Revised by the Author", 'isbn13': '9780451218599', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0451218590', 'isbn10': '0451218590'}}
