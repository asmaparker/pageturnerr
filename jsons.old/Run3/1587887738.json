Recorded unabridged in Bookcassette Audio are "Call of the Wild" and three special Klondike stories: "To Build a Fire", "Love of Life" and "To the Man on the Trail". In "Call of the Wild", a domestic dog is kidnapped from his comfortable life on a California estate and thrown into the wild north woods. Buck, half St. Bernard and half Scottish shepherd, is a strong dog but not accustomed to the harsh life of the north and he must fight for survival. He learns how to work hard; how to dig a hole in a snowbank to stay warm; how to eat anything no matter how loathsome; how to scent the weather; how to break ice to find water; and most importantly, how to survive cruelty. At one of the worst moments in his life, Buck receives unexpected human kindness from a new master. With the kind of devotion that only a dog can give, he shows loyalty to his master in ways that are both touching and profound.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/34/9781587887734.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Call of the Wild', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 5, 'date_published': '2001-09-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Action & Adventure'], 'authors': ['Jack London'], 'title': 'The Call of the Wild', 'isbn13': '9781587887734', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Audio Cassette', 'isbn': '1587887738', 'isbn10': '1587887738'}}
