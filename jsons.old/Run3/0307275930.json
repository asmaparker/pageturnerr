{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'From one of the most important writers of the twentieth century comes a stunning love story about a young Black woman whose life is torn apart when her lover is wrongly accused of a crime—"a moving, painful story, so vividly human and so obviously based on reality that it strikes us as timeless" (The New York Times Book Review).<br/><br/>"One of the best books Baldwin has ever written—perhaps the best of all." —The Philadelphia Inquirer<br/><br/>Told through the eyes of Tish, a nineteen-year-old girl, in love with Fonny, a young sculptor who is the father of her child, Baldwin’s story mixes the sweet and the sad. Tish and Fonny have pledged to get married, but Fonny is falsely accused of a terrible crime and imprisoned. Their families set out to clear his name, and as they face an uncertain future, the young lovers experience a kaleidoscope of emotions—affection, despair, and hope. In a love story that evokes the blues, where passion and sadness are inevitably intertwined, Baldwin has created two characters so alive and profoundly realized that they are unforgettably ingrained in the American psyche.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/36/9780307275936.jpg', 'title_long': 'If Beale Street Could Talk', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.6 Inches, Length: 7.9 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 5.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}}, 'pages': 197, 'date_published': '2006-10-10', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'United States', 'Black & African American', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['James Baldwin'], 'title': 'If Beale Street Could Talk', 'isbn13': '9780307275936', 'msrp': 11.06, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0804149674'}, 'isbn': '0307275930', 'isbn10': '0307275930', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780804149679', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
