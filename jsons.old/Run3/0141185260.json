{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Books', 'synopsis': "The American poet John Shade is dead; murdered. His last poem, Pale Fire, is put into a book, together with a preface, a lengthy commentary and notes by Shade's editor, Charles Kinbote. Known on campus as the 'Great Beaver', Kinbote is haughty, inquisitive, intolerant, but is he also mad, bad - and even dangerous? As his wildly eccentric annotations slide into the personal and the fantastical, Kinbote reveals perhaps more than he should. Nabokov's darkly witty, richly inventive masterwork is a suspenseful whodunit, a story of one-upmanship and dubious penmanship, and a glorious literary conundrum.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/62/9780141185262.jpg', 'title_long': 'Pale Fire by Nabokov, Vladimir ( Author ) ON Aug-31-2000, Paperback', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.5118 Inches, Weight: 0.53351867404 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5118}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7874}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.53351867404}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2010', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['Vladimir Nabokov'], 'title': 'Pale Fire by Nabokov, Vladimir ( Author ) ON Aug-31-2000, Paperback', 'isbn13': '9780141185262', 'msrp': 19.75, 'binding': 'Unknown Binding', 'isbn': '0141185260', 'isbn10': '0141185260'}}
