{'book': {'publisher': 'Taschen America Llc', 'synopsis': 'Richard Kern likes real women: unpretentious, unadorned, and definitely undressed. Those who love Kern know each book is an invitation to join him in his privileged world where natural young women share their most intimate moments. Richard has never lost his boyish curiosity with girls and their secrets, so instead of posing them in sterile sets he follows them through the house—or rather his New York apartment—from backyard to kitchen to bathroom to bedroom, capturing every sexy and embarrassing moment. Action is his most revealing book yet. For 280 pages we careen through the life of Kern, accompanied by dozens of energetic, fun-loving, clothes-dropping exhibitionists. “Young women want to show the world they’re not like their man-hating women’s lib mothers,” a Kern model once told me, and these girls certainly get the point across. To further assist the young ladies in their rebellion, the book includes an hour-long DVD of original Kern film with an exclusive musical score by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/99/9783822856499.jpg', 'title_long': 'Richard Kern: Action', 'edition': 'Har/DVD', 'dimensions': 'height: 307 mm, length: 232 mm, width: 31 mm, weight: 1814 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 232}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 1814}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 307}}, 'date_published': '2007-04-04', 'subjects': ['Parenting & Relationships', 'Reference', 'Arts & Photography', 'Photography & Video', 'Erotic Photography', 'Equipment, Techniques & Reference', 'Photojournalism & Essays'], 'authors': ['Richard Kern'], 'title': 'Richard Kern: Action', 'isbn13': '9783822856499', 'msrp': 39.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '3822856495', 'isbn10': '3822856495'}}
