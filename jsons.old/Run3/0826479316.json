The first essay traces the fracture lines which force capitalist society into perpetual crisis. The second, written immediately after the global best-seller, Empire, develops the two key concepts of empire and multitude. Time for Revolution illuminates the course of Negri\'s thinking from the 1980s to Empire and beyond.      Review      "We discover here another Negri, a Negri deeply immersed in a philosophical, even a theological problematic.
