{'book': {'publisher': 'Anchor', 'synopsis': 'Lydia Kilkenny is eager to move beyond her South Boston childhood, and when she marries Henry Wickett, a shy Boston Brahmin who plans to become a doctor, her future seems assured. That path changes when Henry abandons his medical studies and enlists Lydia to help him invent a mail-order medicine called Wickett’s Remedy. Then the 1918 influenza epidemic sweeps through Boston, and in a world turned upside down Lydia must forge her own path through the tragedy unfolding around her. As she secures work as a nurse at a curious island medical station conducting human research into the disease, Henry’s former business partner steals the formula for Wickett’s Remedy to create for himself a new future, trying—and almost succeeding—to erase the past he is leaving behind.<br/><br/>Alive with narrative ingenuity, and tinged with humor as well as sorrow, this inspired recreation of a forgotten era powerfully reminds us how much individual voices matter—in history and in life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/27/9781400078127.jpg', 'title_long': "Wickett's Remedy: A Novel", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.675 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.83}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.675}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006-10-10', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Myla Goldberg'], 'title': "Wickett's Remedy: A Novel", 'isbn13': '9781400078127', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307493172'}, 'isbn': '1400078121', 'isbn10': '1400078121', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307493170', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
