{'book': {'publisher': 'Polity', 'synopsis': 'Žižek is hailed as the most significant interdisciplinary thinker of modern times. His work is a powerful, often explosive combination of Lacanian psychoanalysis and philosophy which tests key psychoanalytical concepts against the ideas of major European thinkers, especially Hegel. It has ignited enthusiasm and stimulated new approaches across a vast range of disciplines, and seems to be attracting an ever-growing readership. In part, this is because Žižek himself has a panoramic range of interests encompassing film studies, literature, cyber culture, ethics, theology and, above all, politics. It is also because he is a highly entertaining writer, having a flair for anecdote, a smutty sense of humour and the knack of capturing complex ideas in concrete form.<br/><br/>Sarah Kay’s book provides a lucid and comprehensive introduction to Žižek’s work. His writings to date are presented and evaluated here for the first time, together with an outline of their development and explanations of his key premises, themes and terms. This book will be essential reading for students of cultural studies, literary studies, philosophy and social and political theory.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/88/9780745622088.jpg', 'title_long': 'Zizek: A Critical Introduction', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.098407 Inches, Length: 6.039358 Inches, Weight: 0.7605948039 Pounds, Width: 0.641731 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.039358}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.641731}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7605948039}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.098407}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2003-04-29', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Philosophers', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'History & Surveys', 'Modern', 'Sociology', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Sarah Kay'], 'title': 'Zizek: A Critical Introduction', 'isbn13': '9780745622088', 'msrp': 20.83, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0745622089', 'isbn10': '0745622089'}}
