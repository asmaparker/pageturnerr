{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': "Renowned as a novelist, journalist, and humorist, Mark Twain is not only one of the most widely read and admired American writers, he is also among the most quoted. Wit and repartee permeate his work â€” from the short, light pieces to his great novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and even later, in dark meditations on the human condition where his humor takes on a cynical, satirical twist.<br/>This remarkably inexpensive volume gathers together hundreds of Twain's most memorable quips and comments on life, love, history, culture, travel, and a diversity of other topics that occupied his thoughts over 50 years of writing and lecturing.<br/>An invaluable, ready reference for writers, speakers, and others in search of amusing and insightful quotes, this entertaining and thought-provoking compilation is also an ideal introduction to Twain's inimitable style and thought.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/40/9780486406640.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain: A Book of Quotations (Dover Thrift Editions: Speeches/Quotes)', 'edition': 'New edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.11904962148 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.11904962148}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 64, 'date_published': '1998-12-23', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Regional & Cultural', 'United States', 'Anthologies'], 'authors': ['Mark Twain'], 'title': 'The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain: A Book of Quotations (Dover Thrift Editions: Speeches/Quotes)', 'isbn13': '9780486406640', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0486111326'}, 'isbn': '0486406644', 'isbn10': '0486406644', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486111322', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
