The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier work, The Hobbit, but developed into a much larger story. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, with much of it being created during World War II.[1] Although intended as a single-volume work, it was originally published in three volumes in 1954 and 1955, and it is in this three-volume form that it is popularly known. It has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many different languages,[2] becoming one of the most popular and influential works in 20th-century literature.", 'language': 'zh', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/70/9789570823370.jpg', 'title_long': "Mo jie er bu qu: shuang cheng qi mou ('The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' in Traditional Chinese Characters)", 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.90551 Inches, Length: 8.18896 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 5.78739 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.18896}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.78739}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.90551}}, 'date_published': '1656', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['J.
