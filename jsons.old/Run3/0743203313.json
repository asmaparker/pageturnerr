Helen, her mother, Lily, and her grandmother, Dora, have come together to tend to Helen\'s brother, Declan, who is dying of AIDS. With Declan\'s two friends, the six of them are forced to plumb the shoals of their own histories and to come to terms with each other.<br/><br/>Shortlisted for the Booker Prize, The Blackwater Lightship is a deeply resonant story about three generations of an estranged family reuniting to mourn an untimely death. In spare, luminous prose, Colm Tóibín explores the nature of love and the complex emotions inside a family at war with itself. Hailed as "a genuine work of art" (Chicago Tribune), this is a novel about the capacity of stories to heal the deepest wounds.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/19/9780743203319.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Blackwater Lightship', 'edition': '4th Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.54674640976 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.54674640976}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2001-06-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'British & Irish', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Colm Toibin'], 'title': 'The Blackwater Lightship', 'isbn13': '9780743203319', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1501106929'}, 'isbn': '0743203313', 'isbn10': '0743203313', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781501106927', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
