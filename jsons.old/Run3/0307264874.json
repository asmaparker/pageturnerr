{'book': {'publisher': "Everyman's Library", 'synopsis': 'Seven books in one hardcover volume from the bestselling, award-winning author of The Year of Magical Thinking: including the full texts of Slouching Towards Bethlehem; The White Album; Salvador; Miami; After Henry; Political Fictions; and Where I Was From.<br/><br/>As featured in the Netflix documentary Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold.<br/><br/>Joan Didion’s incomparable and distinctive essays and journalism are admired for their acute, incisive observations and their spare, elegant style. Now the seven books of nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003 have been brought together into one thrilling collection.<br/><br/>Slouching Towards Bethlehem captures the counterculture of the sixties, its mood and lifestyle, as symbolized by California, Joan Baez, Haight-Ashbury. The White Album covers the revolutionary politics and the “contemporary wasteland” of the late sixties and early seventies, in pieces on the Manson family, the Black Panthers, and Hollywood. Salvador is a riveting look at the social and political landscape of civil war. Miami exposes the secret role this largely Latin city played in the Cold War, from the Bay of Pigs through Watergate. In After Henry Didion reports on the Reagans, Patty Hearst, and the Central Park jogger case. The eight essays in Political Fictions–on censorship in the media, Gingrich, Clinton, Starr, and “compassionate conservatism,” among others–show us how we got to the political scene of today. And in Where I Was From Didion shows that California was never the land of the golden dream."<br/><br/>Everyman\'s Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket. Contemporary Classics include an introduction, a select bibliography, and a chronology of the author\'s life and times.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/79/9780307264879.jpg', 'title_long': "We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live: Collected Nonfiction (Everyman's Library)", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.27 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Weight: 0.004739938633 pounds, Width: 1.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.44}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.004739938633}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.27}}, 'pages': 1160, 'date_published': '2006-10-17', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'History & Criticism', 'Women Authors', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Politics & Social Sciences', "Women's Studies", 'Women Writers'], 'authors': ['Joan Didion'], 'title': "We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live: Collected Nonfiction (Everyman's Library)", 'isbn13': '9780307264879', 'msrp': 35, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0307264874', 'isbn10': '0307264874'}}
