{'book': {'publisher': 'Piatkus', 'synopsis': "Carrie Bell was born and raised in Wisconsin. She's had the same best friend, the same good relationship with her mother, the same boyfriend for as long as anyone can remember. She is already quietly bored with Mike when he is horrifically injured in a diving accident at Clausen's Reservoir. Now the future that Carrie was only beginning to rebel against looks set in stone. Everyone thinks they know what Carrie will - and ought to - do. But Carrie is caught in a maze of moral dilemmas and is forced to question everything she thought she knew about herself. It is a moment of terrifying confusion, but also of mesmerising possibility.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/30/9780749933630.jpg', 'title_long': "The Dive from Clausen's Pier", 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75589 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Weight: 0.5952481074 Pounds, Width: 1.06299 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1181}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.06299}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5952481074}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75589}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Ann Packer'], 'title': "The Dive from Clausen's Pier", 'isbn13': '9780749933630', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0749933631', 'isbn10': '0749933631'}}
