Black drew hard, squinting as the smoke rushed into his lungs.<br/>"Where do you want to start?"the lawyer said, lighting a cigarette of his own.<br/>"I guess there’s only one place to start; at Broad and Erie."<br/><br/>Johnny Podres, a politician whose record against corruption had been propelling him straight to the mayor’s office, is found murdered in a North Philly crack house.<br/><br/>Enter Samuel Jackson, a.k.a. Black, a drug addict who knows better, a man embittered by the fact that he can’t seem to escape from his addiction to crack cocaine or, for that matter, from himself. Though he was once a family man with a wife and son, Black’s only concern these days is getting his next high, that is, until he stumbles across a friend and fellow addict, Leroy, and both become prime suspects in the Podres murder. Black and Leroy hook up with two female pipers: Clarisse, a registered nurse who is slowly losing to crack any semblance of a respectable life, and Pookie, who already has lost it. Soon the hunt is on for all four as they try to stay one step ahead of a police department under tremendous pressure to solve the case—because if a killer isn’t found soon, this could blow up into one of the biggest scandals in Philadelphia history.<br/><br/>Solomon Jones weaves a suspenseful story against the backdrop of corruption in the Philadelphia police department and centers it on a group of drug addicts who, in the process of fleeing the law, come to terms with their own addiction, leading to some devastating consequences.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/03/9780375756603.jpg', 'title_long': 'Pipe Dream: A Novel (Strivers Row)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.63713593718 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63713593718}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2001-07-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Solomon Jones'], 'title': 'Pipe Dream: A Novel (Strivers Row)', 'isbn13': '9780375756603', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0375506594'}, 'isbn': '0375756604', 'isbn10': '0375756604', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780375506598', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
