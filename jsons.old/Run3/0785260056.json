Maxwell demonstrates how we can live with integrity by using the Golden Rule as our standard-in business and in life. In fact, Maxwell suggests the higher standard of exceeding the Golden Rule-by treating people better than they treat us, helping those who cannot help us, doing right when it is natural to do wrong, and keeping promises, even when it hurts.<br/>An ethics guide for any situation, each "day" of The Power of One offers a Drilling Down section which features a case study or story that illustrates the day\'s topic, Summarizing Principles on the subject, penetrating questions for Making Evaluation, and points of application for Taking Action.
