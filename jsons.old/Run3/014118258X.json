{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Books, Limited (UK)', 'synopsis': 'Dorothy Parker, more than any of her contemporaries, captured the spirit of her age in her writing. The decadent 1920S and 1930s in New York were a time of great experiment and daring for women. For the rich, life seemed a continual party, but the excesses took their emotional toll. With a biting wit and perceptive insight, Dorothy Parker examines the social mores of her day and exposes the darkness beneath the dazzle. Her own life exemplified this duality, for a while she was one of the most talked-about women of her day, she was also known as a "masochist whose passion for unhappiness knew no bounds". As philosopher Irwin Edman said, she was "a Sappho who could combine a heartbreak with a wisecrack". Her dissection of the jazz age in poetry and prose is collected in this volume along with articles and reviews.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/82/9780141182582.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Collected Dorothy Parker', 'edition': 'New', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.96121546232 Pounds, Width: 1.06299 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.06299}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.96121546232}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 640, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories'], 'authors': ['Dorothy Parker'], 'title': 'The Collected Dorothy Parker', 'isbn13': '9780141182582', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '014118258X', 'isbn10': '014118258X'}}
