Then, her old friend -- now America's First Lady -- asks her to investigate the death of her baby. Stunned by grief after the loss of her infant son, the President's wife hints that her child didn't really die of SIDS; in reality, he may have been murdered.<br/><br/>Blind to everything but finding the truth, Barrie delves into the private lives of the president and his wife and uncovers dark and terrible secrets that will test her ethics, her patriotism, and her courage. With the help of Gray Bondurant, a mysterious former presidential aide, this story could topple the presidency and change the course of history.<br/><br/>In this fast-moving tale from a master of suspense, Barrie must fight powerful forces that want nothing more than to see the scandalous past -- and a certain young reporter -- dead and buried.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/39/9780446604239.jpg', 'title_long': 'Exclusive', 'edition': 'Later Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4 Inches, Weight: 0.52029093832 Pounds, Width: 1.75 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.52029093832}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '1997-07-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Sandra Brown'], 'title': 'Exclusive', 'isbn13': '9780446604239', 'msrp': 7.28, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0446604232', 'isbn10': '0446604232'}}
