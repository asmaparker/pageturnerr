But then her latest purchase—a vase with the Celtic goddess Epona on it—somehow switches her into the world of Partholon, where she's treated like a goddess. A very temperamental goddess\x85<br/><br/>It seems that Shannon has stepped into another's role as the Goddess Incarnate of Epona. And while it has some very appealing moments—what woman doesn't like a little pampering now and then?—it also comes with a ritual marriage to a centaur and the threat of war against the evil Fomorians. Oh, and everyone disliking her because they think she's her double.<br/><br/>Somehow Shannon needs to figure out how to get back to Oklahoma without being killed, married to a horse or losing her mind\x85.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/70/9780373802470.jpg', 'title_long': 'Divine by Mistake (Partholon, 3)', 'edition': 'Original', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.61 Inches, Length: 4.2200703 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2200703}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.61}}, 'pages': 704, 'date_published': '2006-08-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Romantic'], 'authors': ['P.C.
