{'book': {'publisher': 'Chronicle Books', 'synopsis': "At the dawn of the Middle Ages, a gripping tale of chivalry and suspense emerges. Two distinguished knights -- one Saxon, one Norman -- have returned from the Crusades. Though they fought on the same side, they now have a score to settle. What begins as a joust between two rivals quickly escalates into clanwide mayhem and a fast-paced series of battles for revenge, honor, and love.<br/>Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe was one of the first great historical novels of western literature. At last, this extraordinary work has been brought to life as a lavishly illustrated storybook. Marianna Mayer's inspired adaptation combined with magnificent oil paintings by John Rush create an essential introduction to the classic. This exquisitely designed page-turning volume is perfect for anyone with a passion for adventure.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/89/9781587172489.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ivanhoe', 'edition': 'Abridged edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.3 Inches, Length: 8.4 Inches, Weight: 0.44 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.44}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.3}}, 'pages': 56, 'date_published': '2004-09-30', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['Marianna Mayer'], 'title': 'Ivanhoe', 'isbn13': '9781587172489', 'msrp': 17.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1587172488', 'isbn10': '1587172488'}}
