As director of the Leabrook Glass Museum, she's been asked to travel to Frog Cove Island -- an artistic haven near Seattle -- to catalog an important collection of art glass. But thanks to unsavory rumors surrounding the collector's death, the museum insists that Eugenia take along Cyrus Chandler Colfax -- a rough-hewn private investigator whose taste in glass runs to ice-cold bottles filled with beer.<br/>When Colfax declares they must pose as a couple, Eugenia protests in a manner as loud as his Hawaiian shirts. But now their very lives depend on the most artful collaboration they can imagine. For a killer is lurking among Frog Cove's chic galleries, and if anyone sees through their marital masquerade, their own secret agendas -- as well as their plans for survival -- may be smashed to smithereens!<br/>Love's passionate snags get the smooth touch in this sparkling masterpiece from Jayne Ann Krentz!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/98/9780671524098.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sharp Edges', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '1998-09-01', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Jayne Ann Krentz'], 'title': 'Sharp Edges', 'isbn13': '9780671524098', 'msrp': 7.5, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0671524097', 'isbn10': '0671524097'}}
