{'book': {'publisher': 'Fawcett', 'synopsis': 'The Bridge at Andau is James A. Michener at his most gripping. His classic nonfiction account of a doomed uprising is as searing and unforgettable as any of his bestselling novels. For five brief, glorious days in the autumn of 1956, the Hungarian revolution gave its people a glimpse at a different kind of future—until, at four o’clock in the morning on a Sunday in November, the citizens of Budapest awoke to the shattering sound of Russian tanks ravaging their streets. The revolution was over. But freedom beckoned in the form of a small footbridge at Andau, on the Austrian border. By an accident of history it became, for a few harrowing weeks, one of the most important crossings in the world, as the soul of a nation fled across its unsteady planks.<br/><br/>Praise for The Bridge at Andau<br/><br/>“Precise, vivid . . . immeasurably stirring.”—The Atlantic Monthly<br/><br/>“Dramatic, chilling, enraging.”—San Francisco Chronicle<br/><br/>“Superb.”—Kirkus Reviews<br/><br/>“Highly recommended reading.”—Library Journal', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/05/9780449210505.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Bridge at Andau: The Compelling True Story of a Brave, Embattled People', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.9 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.35053499658 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35053499658}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.9}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1985-09-12', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'History', 'World War II', 'World'], 'authors': ['James A.
