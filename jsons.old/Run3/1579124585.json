The result is a vivid history that could only be enhanced by actual historic photographs.<br/><br/>The Right Stuff Illustrated includes hundreds of photographs and reproductions of documents and memorabilia pertaining to the Project Mercury program, the current events surrounding the program, and the political climate that led up to the missions in the early 1960’s.
