{'book': {'publisher': 'Washington Square Press', 'synopsis': 'New Orleans, 1920s. Raziela Nolan is in the throes of a magnificent love affair when she dies in a tragic accident. In an instant, she leaves behind her one true love and her dream of becoming a doctor -- but somehow, she still remains. Immediately after her death, Razi chooses to stay between -- a realm that exists after life and before whatever lies beyond it.<br/><br/>From this remarkable vantage point, Razi narrates the stories of her lost love, Andrew, and the relationship of Amy and Scott, a couple whose house she haunts almost seventy-five years later. The Mercy of Thin Air entwines these two fateful and redemptive love stories that echo across three generations. From ambitious, forward-thinking Razi, who illegally slips birth control guides into library books; to hip Web designer Amy, who begins to fall off the edge of grief; to Eugenia, caught between since the Civil War, the characters in this wondrous novel sing with life. Evoking the power of love, memory, and time, The Mercy of Thin Air culminates in a startling finish that will leave readers breathless.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/29/9780743278829.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Mercy of Thin Air: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.3333 Inches, Weight: 0.63 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3333}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2006-06-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Horror', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Ronlyn Domingue'], 'title': 'The Mercy of Thin Air: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780743278829', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1416524657'}, 'isbn': '0743278828', 'isbn10': '0743278828', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416524656', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
