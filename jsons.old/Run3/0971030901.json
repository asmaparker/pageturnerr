{'book': {'publisher': 'Keep It Simple Books', 'synopsis': 'This book reveals the origin of self-hate, how self-hate works, how to identify it, and how to go beyond it. It provides examples of some of the forms self-hate takes, including taking blame but not credit, holding grudges, and trying to be perfect, and explores the many facets of self-hate, including its role in addiction, the battering cycle, and the illusion of control. After addressing these factors, it illustrates how a meditation practice can be developed and practiced in efforts to free oneself from self-hating beliefs.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/09/9780971030909.jpg', 'title_long': 'There Is Nothing Wrong with You: Going Beyond Self-Hate', 'edition': 'Revised edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 264, 'date_published': '2001-10-01', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Happiness', 'Self-Esteem', 'Spiritual', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Cheri Huber'], 'title': 'There Is Nothing Wrong with You: Going Beyond Self-Hate', 'isbn13': '9780971030909', 'msrp': 12, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0971030901', 'isbn10': '0971030901', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781733707091', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
