Now twenty-four, Phoenix is launching a career as an R&B singer. She's living out her dreams and seems destined for fame and fortune. But a chance visit to a historical site in St. Louis ignites a series of bizarre, erotic encounters with a spirit who may be the King of Ragtime, Scott Joplin.<br/><br/>The sound of Scott Joplin is strange enough to the ears of the hip-hop generation. But the idea that these antique sounds are being channeled through Phoenix? Her life is suddenly hanging in the balance. How will she find her true voice and calling? Can the power of her own inner song give Phoenix the strength to fight to live out her own future? Or will she be forever trapped in Scott Joplin's doomed, tragic past? Stunningly original, Joplin's Ghost is a novel filled with art and intrigue—and is sure to bring music to readers' ears.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/45/9780743449045.jpg', 'title_long': "Joplin's Ghost: A Novel", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.3333 Inches, Weight: 0.95019234922 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3333}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95019234922}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2006-09-19', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Regional & Cultural', 'United States', 'Black & African American', 'Erotica', 'Suspense', 'Thrillers', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Tananarive Due'], 'title': "Joplin's Ghost: A Novel", 'isbn13': '9780743449045', 'msrp': 28.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1416510478'}, 'isbn': '0743449045', 'isbn10': '0743449045', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416510475', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
