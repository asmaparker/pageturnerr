{'book': {'publisher': '-----', 'synopsis': 'Early short stories by Thomas Pynchon, introduced by the author and praised as "an exhilarating spectacle of greatness discovering its powers" by the New Republic.<br/><br/>Thomas Pynchon\'s literary career was launched not with the release of his widely acclaimed first novel, V., but with the publication in literary magazines of the five stories collected here.

Time magazine described this introductory essay as "Pynchon\'s first public gesture toward autobiography."<br/><br/>"Funny and wise enough to charm the gravity from a rainbow...All five of the pieces have unusual narrative vigor and inventiveness." --New York Times', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/32/9780316724432.jpg', 'title_long': 'Slow learner', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.54895103238 Pounds, Width: 0.625 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.625}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.54895103238}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2014', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Absurdist', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors': ['H.
