{'book': {'publisher': 'L.A. Weekly Books', 'synopsis': "Okay, so at least you're interested enough to pick up this book and look inside. I think you and I are going to get along just fine.<br/><br/>Life is full of choices. Right now, yours is whether or not to buy the autobiography of a mid-grade, kind of hammy actor.<br/><br/>Am I supposed to know this guy? you think to yourself.<br/><br/>No, and that's exactly the point. Bookstores are chock full of household name actors and their high stakes shenanigans. I don't want to be a spoilsport, but we've all been down that road before.<br/><br/>Case in point: look to your left - see that Judy Garland book? You don't need that, you know plenty about her already - great voice, crappy life. Now look to your right at the Charlton Heston book. You don't need to cough up hard-earned dough for that either. You know his story too - great voice, crappy toupee.<br/><br/>The truth is that though you might not have a clue who I am, there are countless working stiffs like me out there, grinding away every day at the wheel of fortune.<br/><br/>If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor is my first book, and I invite you to ride with me through the choppy waters of blue collar Hollywood.<br/><br/>Okay, so buy the damned book already and read like the wind!<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Bruce Campbell<br/><br/>P.S. If the book sucks, at least there are gobs of pictures, and they're not crammed in the middle like all those other actor books.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/57/9780312291457.jpg', 'title_long': 'If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 6.0999878 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 3.35 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.0999878}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 3.35}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.2}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2002-08-24', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'History & Criticism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Bruce Campbell'], 'title': 'If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor', 'isbn13': '9780312291457', 'msrp': 19.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0312291450', 'isbn10': '0312291450', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781250099273', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
