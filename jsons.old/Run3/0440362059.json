{'book': {'publisher': 'Laurel', 'synopsis': 'William Saroyan\'s most celebrated work of short fiction- a boy\'s view of the American Dream. Aram Garoghlanian was a Californian, born in Fresno on the other side of the Southern Pacific tracks. But he was also part of a large, sprawling family of immigrant Armenians--a whole tribe of eccentric uncles, brawling cousins, and gentle women. Through these unforgettable, often hilarious characters Aram comes to understand life, courage, and the power of dreams. Whether it is fierce Uncle Khosrove who yells "Pay no attention to it" in any situation, Uncle Melik, who tries to grow pomegranate trees in the desert, or angelic-looking Cousin Arak who gets Arma into classroom scrapes, Aram\'s visions are shaped and colored by this tum-of-the-century clan. Like Sherwood Anderson\'s Winesburg, Ohio, William Saroyan\'s brilliant short stories in My Name Is Aram work together to create a picture of a time, a place, and a boy\'s world-a truly classic account of an impoverished family newly arrived in America-rich in matters of the heart.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/50/9780440362050.jpg', 'title_long': 'My Name Is Aram', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.20062065842 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.20062065842}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '1991-06-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories'], 'authors': ['William Saroyan'], 'title': 'My Name Is Aram', 'isbn13': '9780440362050', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0440362059', 'isbn10': '0440362059'}}
