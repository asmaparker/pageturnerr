{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Identical twins, sensible Delia and mischievous Cassandra Effington were the most delicious debutantes to ever waltz across a London ballroom. They looked alike in every way . . . but no one ever expected Delia to be the one to get into trouble . . .<br/>How did this young lady's reputation become so questionable?<br/>Once she was lovely, respectable Miss Delia Effington, but an impulsive decision—and subsequent disaster—forces Delia to retire from society. Until one night, desperate for diversion, she attends a ball as her twin sister and finds herself dancing in the strong arms of the dashing Viscount St. Stephens.<br/>Delia believes she has never met this man who arouses her passions, yet he seems somehow familiar. For Delia doesn't know that St. Stephens, an agent for the Crown, has been in her home, protecting her under the disguise of her butler. What will happen when this lady discovers the truth about the man she has come to love?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/18/9780060517618.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Lady in Question (Effington Family & Friends, 7)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-11-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Victorian', 'Regency', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Victoria Alexander'], 'title': 'The Lady in Question (Effington Family & Friends, 7)', 'isbn13': '9780060517618', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061796727', 'ePub': '0061796727'}, 'isbn': '0060517611', 'isbn10': '0060517611', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061796722', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
