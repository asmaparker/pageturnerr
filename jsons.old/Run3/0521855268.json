{'book': {'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'synopsis': "What forces lead to democracy's creation? Why does it sometimes consolidate only to collapse at other times? Written by two of the foremost authorities on this subject in the world, this volume develops a framework for analyzing the creation and consolidation of democracy. It revolutionizes scholarship on the factors underlying government and popular movements toward democracy or dictatorship. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson argue that different social groups prefer different political institutions because of the way they allocate political power and resources. Their book, the subject of a four-day seminar at Harvard's Center for Basic Research in the Social Sciences, was also the basis for the Walras-Bowley lecture at the joint meetings of the European Economic Association and Econometric Society in 2003 and is the winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. Daron Acemoglu is Charles P. Kindleberger Professor of Applied Economics at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received the 2005 John Bates Clark Medal awarded by the American Economic Association as the best economist working in the United States under age 40. He is the author of the forthcoming text Introduction to Modern Economic Growth. James A. Robinson is Professor of Government at Harvard University. He is a Harvard Faculty Associate at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and a member of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Researchâ€™s Program on Institutions, Organizations, and Growth. He is coeditor with Jared Diamond of the forthcoming book Natural Experiments in History.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/66/9780521855266.jpg', 'title_long': 'Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.14 Inches, Weight: 1.6314207388 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.94}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.6314207388}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.21}}, 'pages': 434, 'date_published': '2005-12-19', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic Policy & Development', 'Law', 'Legal Theory & Systems', 'Non-US Legal Systems', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'Political Science', 'Public Affairs & Policy', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Daron Acemoglu', 'James A.
