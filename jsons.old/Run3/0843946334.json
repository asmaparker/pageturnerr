{'book': {'publisher': 'Leisure Books', 'synopsis': "There's something in the attic of Fortyfoot House. Something that rustles. Something that scampers and scratches. Something with fur, far more terrifying than a rat. — Recently divorced, David Williams takes a job restoring Fortyfoot House, a dilapidated 19th-century orphanage, hoping to find peace of mind and get to know his young son, Danny. But then he hears the scratching noises in the attic. And he sees long-dead people walking across the lawn.<br/><br/>Does Fortyfoot House exist in today, yesterday, or tomorrow- or all three at once? Only one thing is certain- it is a house with a dark unthinkable secret that threatens to send David's world hurling into a living nightmare. A nightmare that only David himself can prevent- if he can escape the thing in the attic.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/38/9780843946338.jpg', 'title_long': 'Prey', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '1999', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror'], 'authors': ['Graham Masterton'], 'title': 'Prey', 'isbn13': '9780843946338', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0843946334', 'isbn10': '0843946334'}}
