{'book': {'publisher': 'Washington Square Press', 'synopsis': 'New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her ability to tap into the hearts and minds of real people. Now she explores what happens when a young woman’s past—a past she didn’t even know she had—catches up to her just in time to threaten her future.<br/><br/>How do you recover the past when it was never yours to lose?<br/><br/>Delia Hopkins has led a charmed life. Raised in rural New Hampshire by her beloved, widowed father, she now has a young daughter, a handsome fiancé, and her own search-and-rescue bloodhound, which she uses to find missing persons. But as Delia plans her wedding, she is plagued by flashbacks of a life she can’t recall…until a policeman knocks on her door, revealing a secret about herself that changes the world as she knows it—and threatens to jeopardize her future.<br/><br/>With Vanishing Acts, Jodi Picoult explores how life—as we know it—might not turn out the way we imagined; how the people we’ve loved and trusted can suddenly change before our very eyes; how the memory we thought had vanished could return as a threat. Once again, Picoult handles an astonishing and timely topic with understanding, insight, and compassion.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/51/9780743454551.jpg', 'title_long': 'Vanishing Acts: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.83996121822 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.83996121822}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2005-11-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Domestic Life', 'Sisters', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jodi Picoult'], 'title': 'Vanishing Acts: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780743454551', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1416506705'}, 'isbn': '0743454553', 'isbn10': '0743454553', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416506706', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
