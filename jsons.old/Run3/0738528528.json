{'book': {'publisher': 'Arcadia Publishing', 'synopsis': "Since the 1850s, the soothing countryside hamlets of Sonoma County have beckoned settlers of every stripe-farmers, homesteaders, businesspeople, and commuters. Sebastopol has always been among the county's loveliest towns, retaining its small-town feel even as its population has steadily grown. This book of vintage photography presents Sebastopol's journey through time, the early Mexican land grants and initial settlements, Luther Burbank's far-ranging botanical experiments, and the rich farming industry that made this town one of California's premier agricultural zones, producing grapes, hops, cherries, and dairy products. In these pages readers will experience Sebastopol's turn-of-the-century days at the Apple Fair, with its astonishing fruit sculptures. The first days of railroads are illustrated with images of the Petaluma & Santa Rosa Railway, an electric train system that took passengers to and from Sebastopol Depot. The architecture of the region and the stories of local businesses and institutions are all shown here, along with Sebastopol's early religious institutions, schools, sawmills, factories, and even its small airport in the 1920s. Together with views of the town's sporting teams, natural history, outlying communities, and important citizens, these photographs tell a unique story of a unique place that transcends the generations.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/26/9780738528526.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sebastopol (CA) (Images of America)', 'edition': 'Later Printing Used', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.31 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.56}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2003-09-15', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Photography & Video', 'History', 'Travel', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Pictorial'], 'authors': ['Western Sonoma County Historical Society'], 'title': 'Sebastopol (CA) (Images of America)', 'isbn13': '9780738528526', 'msrp': 11.04, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0738528528', 'isbn10': '0738528528'}}
