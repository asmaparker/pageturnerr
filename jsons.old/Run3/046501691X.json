This wise and profound book has provided thousands of readers with an answer—and has helped them to apply it to their own lives.Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings, needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parents’ expectations and win their ”love.” Alice Miller writes, ”When I used the word ’gifted’ in the title, I had in mind neither children who receive high grades in school nor children talented in a special way. I simply meant all of us who have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to unspeakable cruelty by becoming numb… Without this ’gift’ offered us by nature, we would not have survived.” But merely surviving is not enough. The Drama of the Gifted Child helps us to reclaim our life by discovering our own crucial needs and our own truth.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/14/9780465016914.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self (CN 5097)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.05 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.05}}, 'pages': 113, 'date_published': '1985', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Child Psychology'], 'authors': ['Alice Miller Ruth Ward'], 'title': 'The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self (CN 5097)', 'isbn13': '9780465016914', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '046501691X', 'isbn10': '046501691X'}}
