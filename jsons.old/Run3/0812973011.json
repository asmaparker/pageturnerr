[Mountains Beyond Mountains] inspires, discomforts, and provokes.”—The New York Times (Best Books of the Year)<br/><br/>In medical school, Paul Farmer found his life’s calling: to cure infectious diseases and to bring the lifesaving tools of modern medicine to those who need them most. Tracy Kidder’s magnificent account shows how one person can make a difference in solving global health problems through a clear-eyed understanding of the interaction of politics, wealth, social systems, and disease.
