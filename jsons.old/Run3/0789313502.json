{'book': {'publisher': 'Universe', 'synopsis': "In 1972 David Bowie released the iconic LP The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which established him as a major force in modern pop music. It was also his platform to present a visually fascinating and sexually ambivalent stage persona called Ziggy Stardust. Simultaneously, Bowie befriended the famed rock-and-roll photographer, Mick Rock, whom he invited to chronicle his Ziggy persona on film. Mick Rock amassed an amazing archive of footage that traces the entire stratospheric two-year career of Ziggy Stardust-from the early acclaim to the pivotal American tours, and the final blockbuster concert that marked Ziggy's retirement.Ziggy was a combination of extraordinary costumes, colorful makeup, outrageous hair, and-above all-first-class rock. More than 650 of Mick Rock's compelling pictures reflect his amazing collaboration-and friendship-with Bowie. The result of this incredible collaboration is a vast album of images of onstage performances and backstage antics. Together, David Bowie's text and Mick Rock's images trace the rise and final swansong of Ziggy Stardust. This affordably priced edition will be a must-have for every fan.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/08/9780789313508.jpg', 'title_long': 'Moonage Daydream: The Life & Times of Ziggy Stardust', 'edition': 'y First edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 12 Inches, Length: 8.75 Inches, Weight: 4.35 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 4.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 12}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2005-09-20', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Musical Genres'], 'authors': ['David Bowie'], 'title': 'Moonage Daydream: The Life & Times of Ziggy Stardust', 'isbn13': '9780789313508', 'msrp': 50, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0789313502', 'isbn10': '0789313502'}}
