{'book': {'publisher': 'Picador', 'synopsis': "From the creator of HBO's The Wire, the classic book about homicide investigation that became the basis for the hit television show<br/><br/>The scene is Baltimore. Twice every three days another citizen is shot, stabbed, or bludgeoned to death. At the center of this hurricane of crime is the city's homicide unit, a small brotherhood of hard men who fight for whatever justice is possible in a deadly world.<br/><br/>David Simon was the first reporter ever to gain unlimited access to a homicide unit, and this electrifying book tells the true story of a year on the violent streets of an American city. The narrative follows Donald Worden, a veteran investigator; Harry Edgerton, a black detective in a mostly white unit; and Tom Pellegrini, an earnest rookie who takes on the year's most difficult case, the brutal rape and murder of an eleven-year-old girl.<br/><br/>Originally published fifteen years ago, Homicide became the basis for the acclaimed television show of the same name. This new edition―which includes a new introduction, an afterword, and photographs―revives this classic, riveting tale about the men who work on the dark side of the American experience.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/59/9780805080759.jpg', 'title_long': 'Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.259826 Inches, Length: 6.2999874 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.16 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.2999874}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.16}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.259826}}, 'pages': 672, 'date_published': '2006-08-22', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Espionage', 'Murder & Mayhem', 'Law', 'Criminal Law', 'Law Enforcement', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology', 'Sociology', 'Urban', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['David Simon'], 'title': 'Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets', 'isbn13': '9780805080759', 'msrp': 24, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0805080759', 'isbn10': '0805080759', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781429900959', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
