Now, in her latest novel, she reveals the public scandals of a family destined for political greatness--and the private secrets of a woman who traded her childhood dreams for a role she was born to play....<br/><br/>As a young girl, Liz Adams always knew that her father, Boston power broker Will Adams, had big plans--dreams and schemes that would bring Liz\'s older brother all the way to the White House. But when fate deals the family a tragic blow, Will is forced to change his picture-perfect plans--and place the family\'s political future squarely on Liz\'s shoulders.<br/><br/>Two decades later, Liz has married the man her father molded into the perfect presidential candidate. But weeks before the election, tragedy strikes again--and this time Liz can\'t hide the pain of a life lived by someone else\'s rules. Seeking refuge at her family\'s home on Martha\'s Vineyard, Liz finds only painful memories of the past--and the long-lost love she let slip away.
