Remarkable events accompany his birth, and everyone agrees that his unusual eyes are the most beautiful they have ever seen.<br/><br/>On this same day, a thousand miles away, a ruthless man learns he has a mortal enemy named Bartholomew. He doesn\'t know who Bartholomew is, but he embarks on a search that will become the purpose of his life. If ever he finds the right Bartholomew, he will deal mercilessly with him.<br/><br/>And in San Francisco a girl is born, the result of a violent rape. Her survival is miraculous, and her destiny is mysteriously linked to the fates of Barty and the man who stalks him.<br/><br/>At the age ot three, Barty Lampion is blinded when surgeons reluctantly remove his eyes to save him from a fast-spreading cancer. As the growing boy copes with his blindness and proves to be a prodigy, his mother, an exceptional woman, counsels him that all things happen for a reason, that there is meaning even in his suffering, and that he will affect the lives of people yet unknown to him in ways startling and profound.<br/><br/>At thirteen, Bartholomew regains his sight. How he regains it, why he regains it, and what happens as his amazing life unfolds results in a breathtaking journey of courage, heart-stopping suspense, and high adventure. His mother once told him that every person\'s life has an effect on every other\'s, in often unknowable ways, and Barty\'s eventful life indeed entwines with others in ways that will astonish and move everyone who reads his story.<br/><br/>People magazine has said that Dean Koontz has the "power to scare the daylights out of us." In this, perhaps the most thrilling, suspenseful, and emotionally powerful work of his critically acclaimed career, Koontz does that and far more. He has created a compulsive page-turner that will have you at the edge of your seat, a narrative tour-de-force that will change the way you yourself look at the world.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/95/9780553502695.jpg', 'title_long': 'From the Corner of His Eye', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.16 Inches, Length: 4.13 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 2.63 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.13}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 2.63}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.16}}, 'date_published': '2000-12-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Dean Koontz', 'Stephen Lang'], 'title': 'From the Corner of His Eye', 'isbn13': '9780553502695', 'msrp': 44.95, 'binding': 'Audio Cassette', 'isbn': '0553502697', 'isbn10': '0553502697'}}
