As an additional treat, she also gives instructions in the correct use of impassioned Gallic gestures -- those silent but expressive signals so beloved of the French motorist and shopkeeper. And, most important, she reveals how the French language, both spoken and visual, is a key to the spirit and character of the people who use it. With infectious humor, she exposes the idiosyncratic attitudes that have produced so great a wealth of vivid expressions.<br/>So now discover how the French really feel about sex, food, la belle France, foreigners, hygiene, death...Merde Encore! may confirm what you've always suspected.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/81/9780684854281.jpg', 'title_long': 'Merde Encore!: More of the Real French You Were Never Taught at School (Sexy Slang Series)', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.36 Pounds, Width: 0.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.36}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 112, 'date_published': '1998-12-09', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Puns & Wordplay', 'Language', 'Reference', 'Etiquette', 'Conversation'], 'authors': ['Genevieve'], 'title': 'Merde Encore!: More of the Real French You Were Never Taught at School (Sexy Slang Series)', 'isbn13': '9780684854281', 'msrp': 10.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1501112597'}, 'isbn': '0684854287', 'isbn10': '0684854287', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781501112591', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
