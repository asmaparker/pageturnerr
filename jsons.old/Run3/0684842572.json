{'book': {'publisher': 'Scribner', 'synopsis': 'One might not expect a woman of Edith Wharton\'s literary stature to be a believer of ghost stories, much less be frightened by them, but as she admits in her postscript to this spine-tingling collection, "...till I was twenty-seven or -eight, I could not sleep in the room with a book containing a ghost story." Once her fear was overcome, however, she took to writing tales of the supernatural for publication in the magazines of the day. These eleven finely wrought pieces showcase her mastery of the traditional New England ghost story and her fascination with spirits, hauntings, and other supernatural phenomena. Called "flawlessly eerie" by Ms. magazine, this collection includes "Pomegranate Seed," "The Eyes," "All Souls\'," "The Looking Glass," and "The Triumph of Night."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/78/9780684842578.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Ghost Stories of Edith Wharton', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.69225150268 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.69225150268}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '1997-10-10', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Edith Wharton'], 'title': 'The Ghost Stories of Edith Wharton', 'isbn13': '9780684842578', 'msrp': 18, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1439188521'}, 'isbn': '0684842572', 'isbn10': '0684842572', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781439188521', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
