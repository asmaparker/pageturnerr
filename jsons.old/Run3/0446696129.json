But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: he can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over and the relationship starts to become truly intimate.<br/><br/>When a raging storm hits his small Southern town, single mother Denise Holton's car skids off the road. The young mom is with her four-year-old son Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Taylor McAden finds her unconscious and bleeding, but does not find Kyle. When Denise wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them. Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, a connection between Taylor and Denise takes root. But Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/28/9780446696128.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Rescue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.125 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.125}}, 'pages': 339, 'date_published': '2005-04-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', 'United States', 'Southern', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Nicholas Sparks'], 'title': 'The Rescue', 'isbn13': '9780446696128', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0446696129', 'isbn10': '0446696129'}}
