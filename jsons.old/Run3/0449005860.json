{'book': {'publisher': 'Ballantine Books', 'synopsis': "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee Jimmy Buffett offers his philosophy on life and how to live it, “like sitting with Buffett at a beachside bar, listening to him spin tales” (Time).<br/><br/>“Buffett took his family on a three-week trek around the Caribbean. . . . His colorful travelogue is interspersed with memoirs of his youth and music career—both of which revolve around his continuing search for the perfect fishing spot.”—USA Today<br/><br/>For Parrotheads, armchair adventurers, and anyone who appreciates a good yarn and a hearty laugh, here is the ultimate backstage pass. You’ll read the kind of stories Jimmy usually reserves for his closest friends and you'll see a wonderful, wacky life through the eyes of the man who's lived it.<br/><br/>Jimmy takes us from the legendary pirate coves of the Florida Keys to the ruins of ancient Cartegena. Along the way, we hear a tale or two of how he got his start in New Orleans, how he discovered his passion for flying planes, and how he almost died in a watery crash in Nantucket harbor. We follow Jimmy to jungle outposts in Costa Rica and on a meandering trip down the Amazon, through hair-raising negotiations with gun-toting customs officials and a three-year-old aspiring co-pilot. And he is the inimitable Jimmy Buffett through it all.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/66/9780449005866.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Pirate Looks at Fifty', 'edition': '7th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.18 Inches, Length: 5.53 Inches, Weight: 0.78705027534 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.53}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.78705027534}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.18}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2000-11-28', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Composers & Musicians', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jimmy Buffett'], 'title': 'A Pirate Looks at Fifty', 'isbn13': '9780449005866', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0449005860', 'isbn10': '0449005860'}}
