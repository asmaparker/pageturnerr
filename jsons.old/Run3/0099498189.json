{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House Audio', 'synopsis': "A seductive and evocative epic on an intimate scale, that tells the extraordinary story of a geisha girl. Summoning up more than twenty years of Japan's most dramatic history, it uncovers a hidden world of eroticism and enchantment, exploitation and degradation. From a small fishing village in 1929, the tale moves to the glamorous and decadent heart of Kyoto in the 1930s, where a young peasant girl is sold as servant and apprentice to a renowned geisha house. She tells her story many years later from the Waldorf Astoria in New York; it exquisitely evokes another culture, a different time and the details of an extraordinary way of life. It conjures up the perfection and the ugliness of life behind rice-paper screens, where young girls learn the arts of geisha - dancing and singing, how to wind the kimono, how to walk and pour tea, and how to beguile the most powerful men.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/86/9780099498186.jpg', 'title_long': 'Memoirs of a Geisha', 'edition': 'Reprint.', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.661386786 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.661386786}}, 'pages': 434, 'date_published': '1997-06-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Arthur Golden'], 'title': 'Memoirs of a Geisha', 'isbn13': '9780099498186', 'msrp': 9, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099498189', 'isbn10': '0099498189'}}
