{'book': {'publisher': 'Mariner Books', 'synopsis': 'Biologist, humanist, and bestselling author Richard Dawkins deeply examines the inherent beauty within modern scientific discoveries.<br/>“If any recent writing about science is poetic, it is this” (The Wall Street Journal).<br/>Did Newton "unweave the rainbow" by reducing it to its prismatic colors, as Keats contended? Did he, in other words, diminish beauty? Far from it, says acclaimed scientist Richard Dawkins; Newton\'s unweaving is the key to much of modern astronomy and to the breathtaking poetry of modern cosmology. Mysteries don\'t lose their poetry because they are solved: the solution often is more beautiful than the puzzle, uncovering deeper mysteries.<br/>With the wit, insight, and spellbinding prose that have made him a bestselling author, Dawkins takes up the most important and compelling topics in modern science, from astronomy and genetics to language and virtual reality, combining them in a landmark statement of the human appetite for wonder. Unweaving the Rainbow is a brilliant assessment of what science is (and isn\'t), a tribute to science not because it is useful but because it is uplifting.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/36/9780618056736.jpg', 'title_long': 'Unweaving The Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.84216584084 Pounds, Width: 0.829 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.829}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.84216584084}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2000-04-05', 'subjects': ['Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Crafts & Hobbies', 'Needlecrafts & Textile Crafts', 'Science & Math', 'Evolution', 'History & Philosophy', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Modern', 'Movements'], 'authors': ['Richard Dawkins'], 'title': 'Unweaving The Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder', 'isbn13': '9780618056736', 'msrp': 15.34, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0618056734', 'isbn10': '0618056734', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547347356', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
