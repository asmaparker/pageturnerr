{'book': {'publisher': 'Washington Square Press', 'synopsis': '#1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Weiner brings to life an irresistibly funny and relatable heroine in the novel The Boston Globe called “funny, fanciful, extremely poignant, and rich with insight.”<br/><br/>For twenty-eight years, things have been tripping along nicely for Cannie Shapiro. Sure, her mother has come charging out of the closet, and her father has long since dropped out of her world. But she loves her friends, her rat terrier, Nifkin, and her job as pop culture reporter for The Philadelphia Examiner. She’s even made a tenuous peace with her plus-size body.<br/><br/>But the day she opens up a national women’s magazine and sees the words “Loving a Larger Woman” above her ex-boyfriend’s byline, Cannie is plunged into misery…and the most amazing year of her life. From Philadelphia to Hollywood and back home again, she charts a new course for herself: mourning her losses, facing her past, and figuring out who she is and who she can become.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/71/9780743418171.jpg', 'title_long': 'Good in Bed', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.81130112416 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.81130112416}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2002-04-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Jennifer Weiner'], 'title': 'Good in Bed', 'isbn13': '9780743418171', 'msrp': 11.92, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Unbound': '0743418182', 'ePub': '0743418182'}, 'isbn': '0743418174', 'isbn10': '0743418174', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780743418188', 'binding': 'saleableprint'}]}}
