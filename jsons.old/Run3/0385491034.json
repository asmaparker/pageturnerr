{'book': {'publisher': 'Anchor', 'synopsis': "From the bestselling author of The Handmaid's Tale and The Testaments—one of Margaret Atwood’s most unforgettable characters lurks at the center of this intricate novel like a spider in a web. The glamorous, irresistible, unscrupulous Zenia is nothing less than a fairy-tale villain in the memories of her former friends.<br/><br/>Roz, Charis, and Tony—university classmates decades ago—were reunited at Zenia’s funeral and have met monthly for lunch ever since, obsessively retracing the destructive swath she once cut through their lives. A brilliantly inventive fabulist, Zenia had a talent for exploiting her friends’ weaknesses, wielding intimacy as a weapon and cheating them of money, time, sympathy, and men.<br/><br/>But one day, five years after her funeral, they are shocked to catch sight of Zenia: even her death appears to have been yet another fiction. As the three women plot to confront their larger-than-life nemesis, Atwood proves herself a gleefully acute observer of the treacherous shoals of friendship, trust, desire, and power.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/37/9780385491037.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Robber Bride', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.19 Inches, Weight: 0.8125 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8125}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '1998-01-20', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', "Women's Fiction", 'Friendship', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Margaret Atwood'], 'title': 'The Robber Bride', 'isbn13': '9780385491037', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '030779797X'}, 'isbn': '0385491034', 'isbn10': '0385491034', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307797971', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
