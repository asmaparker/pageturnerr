Their dad has just lost his job and is too proud to go on welfare. Their older brother has moved out of the house in disgust. Which leaves them open to suggestion when a local boxing promotor signs them up for illegal bouts. But it's more than the meager winnings that draws the two brothers in. Soon they find themselves fighting for something else. Is it pride? Love? Or just the experience of winning for once?<br/>A knockout debut from the front lines of a family's recession.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/78/9780439241878.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fighting Ruben Wolfe', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2002-06-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Markus Zusak'], 'title': 'Fighting Ruben Wolfe', 'isbn13': '9780439241878', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0439241871', 'isbn10': '0439241871'}}
