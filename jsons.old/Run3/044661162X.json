Pierce has just moved into a new apartment, and he\'s been "chasing the dime"--doing all it takes so his company comes out first with a scientific breakthrough worth millions. But he can\'t get the messages for Lilly out of his head. As Pierce tries to help a woman he has never met, he steps into a world of escorts, websites, sex, and secret passions. A world where his success and expertise mean nothing...and where he becomes the chief suspect in a murder case, trapped in the fight of his life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/26/9780446611626.jpg', 'title_long': 'Chasing the Dime by Connelly, Michael(September 1, 2003) Mass Market Paperback', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2003-01-01', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors': ['Michael Connelly'], 'title': 'Chasing the Dime by Connelly, Michael(September 1, 2003) Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn13': '9780446611626', 'msrp': 6.64, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '044661162X', 'isbn10': '044661162X'}}
