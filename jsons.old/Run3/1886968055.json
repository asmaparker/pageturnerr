{'book': {'publisher': 'Sidran Pr', 'synopsis': "With the electrifying tales of 15 survivors of catastrophic human cruelty at its narrative core, Unspeakable Truths & Happy Endings resoundingly illuminates both the necessity and difficulty of compassionate, sensible listening to survivors' tales of trauma.The book journalistically explores the affects of survivors's stories on compassionate listeners -- a group that includes therapists but that also includes friends, family, and even survivors themselves as they work and re-work the realities of their own experience. Along the way, the book addresses the flip side of compassionate listening; squabbles about victimhood and recovered memory. The book concludes that, as thinking and caring inhabitants of a menacing world, we must all learn to hear unspeakable truths. At the same time that we risk accepting the truths about violence and degradation that survivors' memories hold, we must reasonably engage critical thinking when memories of violence and degradation stretch the limits of our credulity. We owe it to survivors to listen compassionately; we owe it to ourselves to listen prudently.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/59/9781886968059.jpg', 'title_long': 'Unspeakable Truths and Happy Endings: Human Cruelty and the New Trauma Therapy', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 226, 'date_published': '2005-04-01', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Post-traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Pathologies', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Mental Illness'], 'authors': ['Rebecca Coffey'], 'title': 'Unspeakable Truths and Happy Endings: Human Cruelty and the New Trauma Therapy', 'isbn13': '9781886968059', 'msrp': 26.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1886968055', 'isbn10': '1886968055'}}
