{"book": {"publisher": "Kodansha USA Inc", "synopsis": "Tanizaki has long been regarded as one of the giants of twentieth-century Japanese writing. In the postwar period, most of his works have become known worldwide, and his place in modern literature is as assured as it is eminent.<br/>What distinguishes this wonderful new collection--a novella (the title story) and two shorter pieces--is its lightheartedness, its comic realism. All three stories, however, are variations on a favorite theme: dominance and submission in private relationships. The "man" in the title piece is a typical Tanizaki hero--spoiled, self-indulgent, and obstinately ineffectual--caught up in a war between his vindictive former wife and her willful young successor, both rivals of the fourth party in the title: Lily--seductive, elegant, and magnificently in control--a tortoiseshell cat. The struggle among these three female characters for possession of this feckless man, and his bumbling attempts to assert himself, make for a series of richly entertaining confrontations.<br/>This is followed by "The Little Kingdom,' which describes the curiously shifting relationship between a hard-pressed schoolteacher and a small but indomitable pupil determined to establish his own rule. And the collection ends with 'Professor Rado,' a sly portrait of a self-important academic, seen from the point of view of a journalist eager to 'get a story.' In a series of interviews, the professor responds to questions merely with grunts; but by accident the journalist ultimately discovers a scandalous hidden side to this eminently respectable gentleman--one so comically grotesque that it could only have come from Tanizaki\'s well-known store of erotic curiosities.<br/>Here is Tanizaki at his best, displaying--in a first international edition--the skills that made Mishima call his writing 'above all, delicious, like French or Chinese cuisine.'', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/58/9784770016058.jpg", "title_long": "A Cat, a Man, and Two Women", "dimensions": "Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.5 inches, Weight: 0.35053499658 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35053499658}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.25}}, "pages": 164, "date_published": "1991", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Myths & Legends'], 'authors": ["Junichiro Tanizaki'], 'title": "A Cat, a Man, and Two Women", "isbn13": "9784770016058", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "4770016050", "isbn10": "4770016050"}}
