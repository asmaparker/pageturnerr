{"book": {"publisher": "Grand Central Publishing", "synopsis": "In Naked, David Sedaris"s message alternately rendered in Fakespeare, Italian, Spanish, and pidgin Greek is the same: pay attention to me.<br/>Whether he"s taking to the road with a thieving quadriplegic, sorting out the fancy from the extra-fancy in a bleak fruit-packing factory, or celebrating Christmas in the company of a recently paroled prostitute, this collection of memoirs creates a wickedly incisive portrait of an all-too-familiar world. It takes Sedaris from his humiliating bout with obsessive behavior in A Plague of Tics to the title story, where he is finally forced to face his naked self in the mirrored sunglasses of a lunatic. At this soulful and moving moment, he picks potato chip crumbs from his pubic hair and wonders what it all means.<br/>This remarkable journey into his own life follows a path of self-effacement and a lifelong search for identity, leaving him both under suspicion and overdressed.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/30/9781586212230.jpg", "title_long": "Naked", "edition": "Abridged", "dimensions": "Height: 5.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.32187490252 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.32187490252}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}}, "date_published": "2001-10-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays'], 'authors": ["David Sedaris'], 'title": "Naked", "isbn13": "9781586212230", "msrp": 24.98, 'binding": "Audio CD", "isbn": "1586212230", "isbn10": "1586212230"}}
