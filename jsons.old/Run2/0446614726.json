All that remain of the murdered victim are his bones. But after the lobsters are shipped off to Britain"s best restaurants, the whole affair quickly lands on the plate of Constable Hamish Macbeth.<br/><br/>Exiled with his dog, Towser, to the dreary outpost of Cnothan, Macbeth sorely misses his beloved Lochdubh, his formerly beloved Priscilla Halburton-Smythe, and his days of doing nothing but staring at the sheep grazing in a nearby croft. Now the lawman has to contend with a detective chief inspector who wants the modus operandi hushed up, a dark-haired lass who has an ulterior motive to seduce him, and a killer who has made mincemeat of his victim-and without doubt will strike again . . .", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/26/9780446614726.jpg", "title_long": "Death of an Outsider (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 3)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.125 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.59}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.2}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Cozy', 'Supernatural'], 'authors": ["M.
