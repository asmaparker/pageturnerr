Filtered through the consciousness of the novel’s narrator, Ishmael, Moby-Dick draws us into a universe full of fascinating characters and stories, from the noble cannibal Queequeg to the natural history of whales, while reaching existential depths that excite debate and contemplation to this day.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/75/9780679783275.jpg", "title_long": "Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Modern Library Classics)", "edition": "Modern Library", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.22 Inches, Weight: 1.37568451488 Pounds, Width: 1.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.22}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.37568451488}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 896, "date_published": "2000-10-10", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Sea Stories', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Herman Melville'], 'title": "Moby-Dick: or, The Whale (Modern Library Classics)", "isbn13": "9780679783275", "msrp": 12.95, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "067978327X", "isbn10": "067978327X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780553898101", "binding": "print"}]}}
