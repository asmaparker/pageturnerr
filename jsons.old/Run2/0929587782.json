{"book": {"publisher": "Ivan R. Dee", "synopsis": "When Aldous Huxley\"s Brave New World first appeared in 1932, it presented in terms of purest fantasy a society bent on self-destruction. Few of its outraged critics anticipated the onset of another world war with its Holocaust and atomic ruin. In 1948, seeing that the probable shape of his anti-utopia had been altered inevitably by the facts of history, Huxley wrote Ape and Essence. In this savage novel, using the form of a film scenario, he transports us to the year 2108. The setting is Los Angeles where a "rediscovery expedition" from New Zealand is trying to make sense of what is left. From chief botanist Alfred Poole we learn, to our dismay, about the twenty-second-century way of life. 'It was inevitable that Mr. Huxley should have written this book: one could almost have seen it since Hiroshima is the necessary sequel to Brave New World.'―Alfred Kazin. 'The book has a certain awesome impressiveness; its sheer intractable bitterness cannot but affect the reader.'―Time.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/83/9780929587783.jpg", "title_long": "Ape and Essence", "edition": 2, "dimensions": "Height: 8.03 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Weight: 0.57 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.44}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.65}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.57}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.03}}, "pages": 222, "date_published": "1992-08-01", "subjects": ["Literary', 'General', 'FIC028000', 'cs.engls.liter'], 'authors": ["Aldous Huxley'], 'title": "Ape and Essence", "isbn13": "9780929587783", "msrp": 45.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0929587782", "isbn10": "0929587782", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781461741367", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
