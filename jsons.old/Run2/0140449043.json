{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "The classic political dialogue, as relevant today as in Plato"s time<br/><br/>Taking the form of a dialogue between Socrates, Gorgias, Polus and Callicles, Gorgias debates perennial questions about the nature of government and those who aspire to public office. Are high moral standards essential or should we give our preference to the pragmatist who gets things done or negotiates successfully? Should individuals be motivated by a desire for personal power and prestige, or genuine concern for the moral betterment of the citizens? These questions go to the heart of Athenian democratic principles and are more relevant than ever in today"s political climate.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
