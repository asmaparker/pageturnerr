{"book": {"publisher": "Dover Publications", "synopsis": "An influential fantasy writer and a key figure in the Irish literary renaissance, Edward J. M. D. Plunkett, the eighteenth Baron Dunsany (1878-1957) produced a trove of gems of the imagination. The 12 stories here are some of his best. They will take you on a remarkable journey to places that sometimes seem soft and pleasant, sometimes bleak and ominous — but always surprising.<br/>Ten magnificent illustrations by S. H. Simes, perfectly reflecting Dunsany’s mood, accompany<br/>such inventive tales as "The Highwayman," "In the Twilight,' 'The Ghosts,' 'The Lord of Cities,' 'The Doom of La Traviata,' and the title piece. A delight for lovers of fantasy, the volume will enchant readers of folk tales and science fiction as well.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/74/9780486442174.jpg", "title_long": "The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.25}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 112, "date_published": "2005-04-01", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Anthologies'], 'authors": ["Lord Dunsany'], 'title": "The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories", "isbn13": "9780486442174", "msrp": 6.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0486442179", "isbn10": "0486442179"}}
