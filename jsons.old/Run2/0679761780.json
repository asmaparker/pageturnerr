{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "An award-winning play from one of America’s most brilliant writers about a murder in a small Southern town, loosely based on the 1955 killing of Emmett Till. • "A play with fires of fury in its belly, tears of anguish in its eyes, a roar of protest in its throat." —The New York Times<br/><br/>James Baldwin turns a murder and its aftermath into an inquest in which even the most well-intentioned whites are implicated—and in which even a killer receives his share of compassion.<br/><br/>In a small Southern town, a white man murders a black man, then throws his body in the weeds. With this act of violence, James Baldwin launches an unsparing and at times agonizing probe of the wounds of race.<br/><br/>For where once a white storekeeper could have shot a "boy' like Richard Henry with impunity, times have changed. And centuries of brutality and fear, patronage and contempt, are about to erupt in a moment of truth as devastating as a shotgun blast.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/85/9780679761785.jpg", "title_long": "Blues for Mister Charlie: A Play", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.16 inches, Weight: 0.31305641204 Pounds, Width: 0.38 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.16}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.38}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.31305641204}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 144, "date_published": "1995-04-25", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Poetry', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["James Baldwin'], 'title": "Blues for Mister Charlie: A Play", "isbn13": "9780679761785", "msrp": 13.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0804149747"}, "isbn": "0679761780", "isbn10": "0679761780", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780804149747", "binding": "print"}]}}
