{"book": {"publisher": "HarpPeren", "synopsis": "Often I feel I go to some distant region of the world to be reminded of who I really am.<br/>When Michael Crichton -- a Harvard-trained physician, bestselling novelist, and successful movie director -- began to feel isolated in his own life, he decided to widen his horizons. He tracked wild animals in the jungles of Rwanda. He climbed Kilimanjaro and Mayan pyramids. He trekked across a landslide in Pakistan. He swam amid sharks in Tahiti.<br/>Fueled by a powerful curiosity and the need to see, feel, and hear firsthand and close-up, Michael Crichton has experienced adventures as compelling as those he created in his books and films. These adventures -- both physical and spiritual -- are recorded here in Travels, Crichton"s most astonishing and personal work.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/90/57/9780060509057.jpg", "title_long": "Travels", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 377, "date_published": "2002-11-05", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Travel', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Michael Crichton'], 'title": "Travels", "isbn13": "9780060509057", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060509058", "isbn10": "0060509058"}}
