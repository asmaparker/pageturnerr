{"book": {"publisher": "Ecco", "synopsis": "“The Walt Whitman of Los Angeles.”—Joyce Carol Oates, bestselling author<br/>“He brought everybody down to earth, even the angels.”—Leonard Cohen, songwriter<br/>One of Charles Bukowski"s best, this beer-soaked, deliciously degenerate novel follows the wanderings of aspiring writer Henry Chinaski across World War II-era America. Deferred from military service, Chinaski travels from city to city, moving listlessly from one odd job to another, always needing money but never badly enough to keep a job. His day-to-day existence spirals into an endless litany of pathetic whores, sordid rooms, dreary embraces, and drunken brawls, as he makes his bitter, brilliant way from one drink to the next.<br/>Charles Bukowski"s posthumous legend continues to grow. Factotum is a masterfully vivid evocation of slow-paced, low-life urbanity and alcoholism, and an excellent introduction to the fictional world of Charles Bukowski.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/12/71/9780061131271.jpg", "title_long": "Factotum tie-in", "edition": "Media tie-in", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.52}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2006-08-15", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Urban Life', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Charles Bukowski'], 'title": "Factotum tie-in", "isbn13": "9780061131271", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "006113127X", "isbn10": "006113127X"}}
