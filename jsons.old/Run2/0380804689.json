{"book": {"publisher": "Avon", "synopsis": "In the ocean depths, America\"s warriors ceaselessly patrol the dark territory on freedom\"s outer edge. These are the battles fought in silence...and in secret. The newest fight begins when the People\"s Republic of China buys a fleet of highly stealthy and deadly attack subs from a cash–hungry Russia and takes advantage of international unrest to lay claim to territories they have long considered their own. US Commander Tom Garrett is asked to serve as Executive Officer on board the USS Seawolf to monitor the PRC\'s activities as they use all the firepower necessary to close the Straits of Taiwan in preparation for invading their 'renegade province.' As the Chinese fleet moves in for attack, it\'s left to Commander Garrett to sink the Chinese boats, break the PRC siege of Taiwan, and avenge those who were lost in the struggle.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/89/9780380804689.jpg", "title_long": "The Silent Service: Seawolf Class", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.04}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "2002-07-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'War', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'War & Military', 'United States', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Military'], 'authors": ["H.
