{"book": {"publisher": "HarperOne", "synopsis": "“More ambitious than The Alchemist. A thought-provoking tale.” – TIME magazine<br/>In The Fifth Mountain, Paulo Coelho takes us back to the ninth century, to the turbulent Middle East, where the prophet Elijah is struggling to keep his faith alive in a world of constant upheaval, tyrannical royalty, and pagan gods.<br/>Elijah’s story is a lesson in persistence, an exercise in hope, and a journey you will never forget. Inspired by a circumstance that forever altered Coelho’s own life, The Fifth Mountain is a testament to the truth that tragedy in life should not be considered a punishment, but a challenge of the spirit. Gripping in its narrative and graceful in its prose, The Fifth Mountain teaches and inspires like no other novel. This is a timeless story for the ages, a tale of the past that resonates powerfully today.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/01/34/9780060930134.jpg", "title_long": "The Fifth Mountain", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.58}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 245, "date_published": "2000-04-26", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Paulo Coelho'], 'title": "The Fifth Mountain", "isbn13": "9780060930134", "msrp": 13.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060930136", "isbn10": "0060930136"}}
