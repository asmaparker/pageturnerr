{"book": {"publisher": "Picador", "synopsis": "Charles Mason (1728-1786) and Jeremiah Dixon (1733-1779) were the British surveyors best remembered for running the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland that we know today as the Mason-Dixon Line. Here is their story as re-imagined by Thomas Pynchon, featuring Native Americans and frontier folk, ripped bodices, naval warfare, conspiracies erotic and political, and major caffeine abuse. We follow the mismatched pair--one rollicking, the other depressive; one Gothic, the other pre-Romantic--from their first journey together to the Cape of Good Hope, to pre-Revolutionary America and back, through the strange yet redemptive turns of fortune in their later lives, on a grand tour of the Enlightenment"s dark hemisphere, as they observe and participate in the many opportunities for insanity presented them by the Age of Reason.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/09/9780312423209.jpg", "title_long": "Mason & Dixon: A Novel", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.4499891 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1.35 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4499891}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.35}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 784, "date_published": "2004-01-03", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Thomas Pynchon'], 'title": "Mason & Dixon: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780312423209", "msrp": 24, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312423209", "isbn10": "0312423209"}}
