{"book": {"publisher": "Pocket Books", "synopsis": "In Mount Vernon Love Story, bestselling author Mary Higgins Clark reveals the flesh-and-blood man who became the "father of our country" in a story that is charming, insightful, and immensely entertaining.<br/><br/>Always a lover of history, Mary Higgins Clark wrote this extensively researched biographical novel and titled it Aspire to the Heavens, after the motto of George Washington\"s mother. Published in 1969, the book was more recently discovered by a Washington family descendant and reissued as Mount Vernon Love Story. Dispelling the widespread belief that although George Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, he reserved his true love for Sally Carey Fairfax, his best friend\'s wife, Mary Higgins Clark describes the Washington marriage as one full of tenderness and passion, as a bond between two people who shared their lives—even the bitter hardship of a winter in Valley Forge—in every way. In this author\'s skilled hands, the history, the love, and the man come fully and dramatically alive.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/49/9780743448949.jpg", "title_long": "Mount Vernon Love Story: A Novel of George and Martha Washington", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.1875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2003-06-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Romance', 'American', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Mary Higgins Clark'], 'title": "Mount Vernon Love Story: A Novel of George and Martha Washington", "isbn13": "9780743448949", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0743206304"}, "isbn": "0743448944", "isbn10": "0743448944", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780743206303", "binding": "print"}]}}
