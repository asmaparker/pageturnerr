{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "With its vibrant new translation, perceptive introduction, and witty packaging, this new edition of Voltaire’s masterpiece belongs in the hands of every reader pondering our assumptions about human behavior and our place in the world. Candide tells of the hilarious adventures of the naïve Candide, who doggedly believes that “all is for the best” even when faced with injustice, suffering, and despair. Controversial and entertaining, Candide is a book that is vitally relevant today in our world pervaded by—as Candide would say—“the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well.”", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/26/9780143039426.jpg", "title_long": "Candide: Or, Optimism (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)", "edition": "Deluxe", "dimensions": "Height: 8.35 Inches, Length: 5.61 Inches, Weight: 0.50485857998 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.61}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.52}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.50485857998}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.35}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2005-10-25", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Alternate History'], 'authors": ["Francois Voltaire'], 'title": "Candide: Or, Optimism (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)", "isbn13": "9780143039426", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101549742"}, "isbn": "0143039423", "isbn10": "0143039423", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101549742", "binding": "print"}]}}
