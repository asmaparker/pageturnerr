{"book": {"publisher": "Ballantine Books", "synopsis": "“The Imaginary Girlfriend is a miniature autobiography detailing Irving’s parallel careers of writing and wrestling. . . . Tales of encounters with writers (John Cheever, Nelson Algren, Kurt Vonnegut) are intertwined with those about his wrestling teammates and coaches. With humor and compassion, [Irving] details the few truly important lessons he learned about writing. . . . And in beefing up his narrative with anecdotes that are every bit as hilarious as the antics in his novels, Irving combines the lessons of both obsessions (wrestling and writing) . . . into a somber reflection on the importance of living well.”<br/>–The Denver Post", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/61/9780345458261.jpg", "title_long": "The Imaginary Girlfriend: A Memoir", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.425 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.425}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.3}}, "pages": 180, "date_published": "2002-12-03", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Biographies', 'Boxing, Wrestling & MMA', 'Individual Sports', 'Wrestling', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John Irving'], 'title": "The Imaginary Girlfriend: A Memoir", "isbn13": "9780345458261", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345458265", "isbn10": "0345458265"}}
