{"book": {"publisher": "Union Square Kids", "synopsis": "The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch & Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br/><br/>Scott created these drawings in scratchboard an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.<br/><br/>Sneaky pirates, sailing ships, buried treasure, exotic lands, and murderous mutiny: what could be better to win over even the most reluctant boy reader? Robert Louis Stevenson serves up thrills, chills, and plenty of action in this timeless, and much-admired adventure novel.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/73/9781402714573.jpg", "title_long": "Treasure Island (Union Square Kids Unabridged Classics)", "edition": "Unabridged", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.13978989454 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.13978989454}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 232, "date_published": "2004-10-01", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Sea Stories', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Robert Louis Stevenson'], 'title": "Treasure Island (Union Square Kids Unabridged Classics)", "isbn13": "9781402714573", "msrp": 9.95, "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1402714572", "isbn10": "1402714572", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781402792731", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
