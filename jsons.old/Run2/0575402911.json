{"book": {"publisher": "Indigo Paperbacks", "synopsis": "When bestselling novelist Sam Bayer decides it\"s time he wrote his "Great Book", he chooses as his subject the death of a teenage beauty, Pauline Ostrova - the \'Beehive\'. The town of Crane\'s view never felt the same after he discovered her body, floating in the lake, over twenty years before. Her boyfriend, Edward Durant, was arrested for the murder, tried and imprisoned. He died in Sing Sing jail. Sam Bayer\'s new book will tell her story, bring her to life again, and restore something of what the town had lost. But, for Samuel Bayer, the journey into his past becomes a terrifying jolt into the reality of the present. Bayer\'s gesture of respect to his youth turns sour in the face of all that he unearths; for many of the people close to him, this leads to devastating - and fatal - consequences.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/11/9780575402911.jpg", "title_long": "Kissing the Beehive", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75589 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.54233716452 Pounds, Width: 0.70866 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.07873}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.70866}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.54233716452}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75589}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2000", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Jonathan Carroll'], 'title": "Kissing the Beehive", "isbn13": "9780575402911", "msrp": 40.23, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0575402911", "isbn10": "0575402911"}}
