He gets his wish -- and more -- when a troupe of flashy, urbane filmmakers clamors into the nearby town of Drim. Before long bedlam erupts around their make-believe mystery ...and culminates in the sudden appearance of one very real corpse.<br/>The initial suspect in the killing is one Patricia Martyn-Broyd, the aging mystery writer furious that her musty old cozies are getting a risque face-lift in their TV reincarnation. Yet, going behind the scenes, Hamish soon finds a town full of locals bitten by the movie bug and a cast of quarreling show business types, all harboring their own secrets, lies, and hidden agendas. And as the culprit strikes again, Hamish must quickly find the right killer -- or script the wrong finale to a show gone murderously awry.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/81/9780446606981.jpg", "title_long": "Death of a Scriptwriter (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 14)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.125 Inches, Weight: 0.24912235606 Pounds, Width: 0.625 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.625}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.24912235606}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "1999-06-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["M.
