{"book": {"publisher": "Everyman"s Library / Knopf", "synopsis": "One of the 20th century"s enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize–winning career.<br/><br/>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.<br/><br/>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.<br/><br/>Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/34/9781857152234.jpg", "title_long": "One Hundred Years of Solitude", "edition": "Later prt.", "dimensions": "Height: 8.2677 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Weight: 1.1904962148 Pounds, Width: 0.98425 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1181}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.98425}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.1904962148}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.2677}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "1995", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Gabriel Garcia Marquez'], 'title": "One Hundred Years of Solitude", "isbn13": "9781857152234", "msrp": 22.7, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1857152239", "isbn10": "1857152239"}}
