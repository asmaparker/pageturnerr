But all that changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami death god. Any human whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer. With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble goal...or his life?<br/><br/>Light is chafing under L\"s extreme surveillance, but even 64 microphones and cameras hidden in his room aren\"t enough to stop Light. He steps up the game, but before the battle of wits can really begin, a family emergency distracts him. But even though Light isn\'t using the Death Note right now, someone else is! Who\'s the new 'Kira' in town?', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/03/9781421501703.jpg", "title_long": "Death Note, Vol. 3", "edition": "Shonen Jump Advanced", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.37919509064 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.37919509064}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 200, "date_published": "2006-01-03", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery, Thriller & Crime', 'Media Tie-In', 'Shonen', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ["Tsugumi Ohba'], 'title": "Death Note, Vol. 3", "isbn13": "9781421501703", "msrp": 9.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1421501708", "isbn10": "1421501708"}}
