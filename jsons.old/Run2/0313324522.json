{"book": {"publisher": "Holtzbrinck", "synopsis": "The required classics in grades 7-12 are often too complex and removed from adolescent experience. This informative text uses thematic groupings built around recent young adult literature (YAL) as bridges to the classics. This second edition, which the authors have revised and greatly expanded, emphasizes the goal of helping teenagers become lifetime readers, as well as critical and confident readers. By pairing the required classics and young adult literature around common themes, the authors illustrate specific theme connections and include extensive lists of annotated YAL titles at the end of each classic title. The new edition features more than 1,000 titles, hundreds published in the last five years. Thirty-three recent YAL titles are included as theme connectors among the twelve most frequently taught classics.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/29/9780313324529.jpg", "title_long": "From Hinton to Hamlet: Building Bridges between Young Adult Literature and the Classics", "edition": "2", "dimensions": "Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.1401452 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.1401452}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.69}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.2}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.21}}, "pages": 276, "date_published": "2005-08-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Books & Reading', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Movements & Periods', 'Genres & Styles', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors": ["Sarah K.
