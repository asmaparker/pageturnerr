{"book": {"publisher": "Nan A. Talese", "synopsis": "One of the world’s most celebrated authors, Margaret Atwood has penned a collection of smart and entertaining fictional essays, in the genre of her popular books Good Bones and Murder in the Dark, punctuated with wonderful illustrations by the author. Chilling and witty, prescient and personal, delectable and tart, these highly imaginative, vintage Atwoodian mini-fictions speak on a broad range of subjects, reflecting the times we live in with deadly accuracy and knife-edge precision.<br/><br/>In pieces ranging in length from a mere paragraph to several pages, Atwood gives a sly pep talk to the ambitious young; writes about the disconcerting experience of looking at old photos of ourselves; gives us Horatio"s real views on Hamlet; and examines the boons and banes of orphanhood. “Bring Back Mom: An Invocation” explores what life was really like for the “perfect” homemakers of days gone by, and in “The Animals Reject Their Names,” she runs history backward, with surprising results.<br/><br/>Chilling and witty, prescient and personal, delectable and tart, The Tent is vintage Atwood. Enhanced by the author’s delightful drawings, it is perfect for Valentine’s Day, and any other occasion that demands a special, out-of-the-ordinary gift.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/86/9780385516686.jpg", "title_long": "The Tent", "dimensions": "Height: 7.63 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.62 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.14}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.72}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.62}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.63}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "2006-01-10", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays'], 'authors": ['Margaret Atwood'], 'title": "The Tent", "isbn13": "9780385516686", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0385516681", "isbn10": "0385516681"}}
