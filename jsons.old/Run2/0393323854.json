{"book": {"publisher": "W. W. Norton & Company", "synopsis": ""Miracle Fair is Szymborska at her very best."â€•Harvard Book Review Winner of the Heldt Prize for Translation. A new translation of the Nobel Prize-winning Polish poet, with an introduction by Czeslaw Milosz. This long-awaited volume samples the full range of Wislawa Szymborska\"s major themes: the ironies of love, the wonders of nature\'s beauty, and the illusory character of art. Szymborska\'s voice emerges as that of a gentle subversive, self-deprecating in its wit, yet graced with a gift for coaxing the extraordinary out of the ordinary.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/56/9780393323856.jpg", "title_long": "Miracle Fair: Selected Poems of Wislawa Szymborska (Selected Poems of Wislawa Szymborksa)", "edition": "New edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.50044933474}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.3}}, "pages": 172, "date_published": "2002-11-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Women Authors'], 'authors": ["Wislawa Szymborska'], 'title": "Miracle Fair: Selected Poems of Wislawa Szymborska (Selected Poems of Wislawa Szymborksa)", "isbn13": "9780393323856", "msrp": 15.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0393323854", "isbn10": "0393323854"}}
