{"book": {"publisher": "Perennial", "synopsis": ""A defense of fiction and a lesson in the art of reading." —New York Times Book Review<br/>"Testaments Betrayed is to be savored paragraph by paragraph. . . . It must be purchased, read, pondered, and argued within the margins. And frequently reread.' — Washington Post<br/>A brilliant and thought-provoking essay from one of the twentieth century’s masters of fiction, Testaments Betrayed is written like a novel: the same characters appear and reappear throughout the nine parts of the book, as do the principal themes that preoccupy the author. Kundera is a passionate defender of the moral rights of the artist and the respect due a work of art and its creator’s wishes. The betrayal of both—often by their most passionate proponents—is one of the key ideas that informs this strikingly original and elegant book.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/75/16/9780060927516.jpg", "title_long": "Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.54 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.3125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.72}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.54}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 279, "date_published": "1995-01-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'History & Criticism', 'Genres & Styles', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'World Literature', 'European', 'Ancient & Medieval Literature', 'Roman', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Milan Kundera'], 'title": "Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts", "isbn13": "9780060927516", "msrp": 12.2, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060927518", "isbn10": "0060927518", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780063290945", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
