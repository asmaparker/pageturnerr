{"book": {"publisher": ""Harry N. Abrams, Inc."", 'synopsis": "A Pop Ink Book by Charles S. Anderson Design Company<br/><br/>From Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to B horror movie icons to The Addams Family and beyond, macabre misfits have thrived in the fertile soil of American modern-age media and pop culture. Brought to Abrams by the creators of the successful Happy Kitty Bunny Pony: A Saccharine Mouthful of Super Cute, Goth-icky celebrates the American goth, their culture, and the vampires, zombies, skeletons, and other mutants that inspire them.<br/><br/>Containing more than 200 images from the print and advertising archives of Charles S. Anderson Design Company in combination with a sharply hilarious text by Michael J. Nelson, the main writer and host of the legendary Mystery Science Theater 3000, Goth-icky is a kitsch and campy testament to America"s love of horror. So break out the black lipstick, curl up in your coffin, and get ready for some freaky fun!", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/93/9780810957893.jpg", "title_long": "Goth-Icky: A Macabre Menagerie of Morbid Monstrosities (A Pop Ink Book)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.25}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "2005-09-01", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Pop Culture', 'Art', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture'], 'authors": ["Michael J.
