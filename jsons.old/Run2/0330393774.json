{"book": {"publisher": "Pan Macmillan", "synopsis": "In 1884, Edwin A. Abbott published a brilliant novel about mathematics and philosophy that charmed and fascinated all of England. As both a witty satire of Victorian society and a means by which to explore the fourth dimension, "Flatland" remains a tour de force. Now, British mathematician and accomplished science writer Ian Stewart has written a fascinating, modern sequel to Abbott\"s book. Through larger-than-life characters and an inspired story line, 'Flatterland' explores our present understanding of the shape and origins of the universe, the nature of space, time, and matter, as well as modern geometries and their applications. The journey begins when our heroine, Victoria Line, comes upon her great-great-grandfather A. Square\'s diary, hidden in the attic. 'The most exciting book I have read this year...truly amazing.' - A.S. Byatt, 'Daily Telegraph'. 'A book in which the hard science is as gripping as the fiction.' - 'The Times'. 'A provocative, ambitious, and enjoyable attempt to ask and answer some of the most interesting Big Questions of modern science...' - 'New Scientist'.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/75/9780330393775.jpg", "title_long": "Flatterland", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75589 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Width: 0.7874 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1181}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7874}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75589}}, "pages": 300, "date_published": "2003", "subjects": ["Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Applied', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Ian Stewart'], 'title": "Flatterland", "isbn13": "9780330393775", "msrp": 16.5, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0330393774", "isbn10": "0330393774"}}
