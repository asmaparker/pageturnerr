Cioran confronts the place of today"s world in the context of human history\x97focusing on such major issues of the twentieth century as human progress, fanaticism, and science\x97in this nihilistic and witty collection of aphoristic essays concerning the nature of civilization in mid-twentieth-century Europe. Touching upon Man"s need to worship, the feebleness of God, the downfall of the Ancient Greeks and the melancholy baseness of all existence, Cioran"s pieces are pessimistic in the extreme, but also display a beautiful certainty that renders them delicate, vivid, and memorable. Illuminating and brutally honest,A Short History of Decay dissects Man's decadence in a remarkable series of moving and beautiful pieces.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/49/9781559704649.jpg", "title_long": "A Short History of Decay", "edition": "1st Arcade paperback ed", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.75 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "1998-09-15", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy'], 'authors": ["E M Cioran'], 'title": "A Short History of Decay", "isbn13": "9781559704649", "msrp": 13.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1559704640", "isbn10": "1559704640"}}
