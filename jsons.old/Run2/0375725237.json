When a debt comes due and his wife and child are held as collateral, he returns to Ireland to secure funds. That pursuit leads to murder. And here is his attempt to present evidence, not of his innocence, but of his life, of the events that lead to the murder he committed because he could. Like a hero out of Nabokov or Camus, Montgomery is a chillingly articulate, self-aware, and amoral being, whose humanity is painfully on display.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/34/9780375725234.jpg", "title_long": "The Book of Evidence", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.5375 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.14}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.59}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5375}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.96}}, "pages": 219, "date_published": "2001-06-12", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John Banville'], 'title": "The Book of Evidence", "isbn13": "9780375725234", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307817121"}, "isbn": "0375725237", "isbn10": "0375725237", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307817129", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
