{"book": {"publisher": "Back Bay Books", "synopsis": "During one month in the autumn of election year 2000, scores of movie-business strivers are focused on one goal: getting a piece of an elusive, but surely huge, television saga, the one that opens with Huns sweeping through Mongolia and closes with a Mormon diviner in the Las Vegas desert; the sure-to-please-everyone multigenerational TV miniseries about diviners, those miracle workers who bring water to perpetually thirsty (and hungry and love-starved) humankind.<br/><br/>Among the wannabes: Vanessa Meandro, hot-tempered head of Means of Production, an indie film company; her harried and varied staff; a Sikh cab driver, promoted to the office of -theory and practice of TV; a bipolar bicycle messenger, who makes a fateful mis-delivery; two celebrity publicists, the Vanderbilt girls; a thriller writer who gives Botox parties; the daughter of an L.A. big-shot, who is hired to fetch Vanessa"s Krispy Kremes and more; a word man who coined the phrase -- inspired by a true story; and a supreme court justice who wants to write the script.A few true artists surface in the course of Moody"s rollicking but intricately woven novel, and real emotion eventually blossoms for most of Vanessa"s staff at Means of Production, even herself.<br/><br/>The Diviners is a cautionary tale about pointless ambition; a richly detailed look at the interlocking worlds of money, politics, addiction, sex, work, and family in modern America; and a masterpiece of comedy that will bring Rick Moody to a still higher level of appreciation.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/77/9780316013277.jpg", "title_long": "The Diviners", "edition": "REPRINT", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.12 Pounds, Width: 0.875 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.875}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.12}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 593, "date_published": "2007-01-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Rick Moody'], 'title": "The Diviners", "isbn13": "9780316013277", "msrp": 14.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0316013277", "isbn10": "0316013277"}}
