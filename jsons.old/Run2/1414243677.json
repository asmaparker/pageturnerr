{"book": {"publisher": "Indypublish.Com", "synopsis": "<p>Both a psychological self-portrait and a profound meditation upon the artistic process, Proust\"s seven-part masterpiece "In Search of Lost Time" changed the course of 20th-century literature. 'Swann\'s Way, ' the first volume, introduces the novel\'s major themes and the narrator, a sensitive man drawn in his youth to fashionable society. Its focus then shifts to Charles Swann, a wealthy connoisseur who moves in high-society circles in nineteenth-century Paris and a victim of an agonizing romance. This masterly evocation of French society and its rendering of a search for a transcendental reality independent of time, ranks as a landmark of world literature.
