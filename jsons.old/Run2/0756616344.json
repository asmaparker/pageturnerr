{"book": {"publisher": "DK", "synopsis": "Unrivaled in its breadth and visual impact, this unique guide sets out to illustrate, describe, and explain the incredible range of creatures that make up the animal kingdom. Exceptional Coverage. This authoritative volume starts with a clear introduction to the animal world, examining the reasons for the apparently infinite variety of animal forms and major evolutionary developments. Animal anatomy, life cycles and the principles of classification are also explored. This is followed by a superbly illustrated survey of world habitats, showing how they have adapted to each environment, and the threats that face both wildlife and plants today. The main part of the book, an up-to-date and comprehensive animal catalog, looks in detail at each major group and provides fascinating profiles of over 2,000 individual species. Visually Breathtaking. Spectacular photographic portraits bring a vast array of animals vividly to life, with special features on well-known and important animals such as the Galapagos tortoise. Each species profile is supported by maps and symbols showing distribution and habitat, as well as key information on size, population, and conservation status, forming an invaluable reference database. Outstanding Reference. Clear, comprehensive, and thought provoking, the Smithsonian Animal is essential reading for wildlife enthusiasts of all ages and levels of experience.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/42/9780756616342.jpg", "title_long": "Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World"s Wildlife", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 4.4 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 4.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.75}}, "pages": 624, "date_published": "2005-09-19", "subjects": ["Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Fauna'], 'authors": ['David Burnie'], 'title": "Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World"s Wildlife", 'isbn13": "9780756616342", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0756616344", "isbn10": "0756616344"}}
