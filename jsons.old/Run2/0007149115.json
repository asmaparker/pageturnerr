{"book": {"publisher": "HarperCollins Publishers Limited", "synopsis": "For the first time in A-format paperback, J.R.R. Tolkien"s novella about the adventures of a bewitched toy dog While on holiday in 1925, four-year-old Michael Tolkien lost his beloved toy dog on the beach at Filey in Yorkshire. To console him, his father, J.R.R.Tolkien, improvised a story about Rover, a real dog who is magically transformed into a toy and is forced to seek out the wizard who wronged him in order to be returned to normal. This charming tale, peopled by a sand-sorcerer and a terrible dragon, by the king of the sea and the Man-in-the-Moon, went through several drafts over the years. Now, more than 70 years on, the adventures of Rover -- or, for reasons that become clear in the story, "Roverandom" -- are published in A format for the first time. Rich in wit and wordplay, Roverandom is edited and introduced by Christina Scull and Wayne G. Hammond and includes Tolkien's own delightful illustrations.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/91/17/9780007149117.jpg", "title_long": "Roverandom", "edition": "later printing", "dimensions": "Height: 6.97 Inches, Length: 4.33 Inches, Weight: 0.18077905484 pounds, Width: 0.35 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.33}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.35}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.18077905484}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.97}}, "pages": 144, "date_published": "2002", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors": ["J.
