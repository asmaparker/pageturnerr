{"book": {"publisher": "St. Martin"s Griffin", "synopsis": "In these wonderfully funny and poignant stories, Willett"s eccentric, complex characters think and do the unconventional. Soft, euphonic women gradually grow old; weak, unhappy men confront love and their own mortality; and abominable children desperately try to grow up with grace. With a unique voice and dry humor, Willett gives us a new insight into human existence, showing us those specific moments in relationships when life suddenly becomes visible.<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed when it was first published in 1987, Jenny and the Jaws of Life is being brought back due to popular demand. It"s a timeless collection filled with a certain freshness and wit that ring just as loudly today.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/82/9780312306182.jpg", "title_long": "Jenny and the Jaws of Life: Short Stories", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.56}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2002-09-14", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Jincy Willett', 'David Sedaris'], 'title": "Jenny and the Jaws of Life: Short Stories", "isbn13": "9780312306182", "msrp": 9.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312306180", "isbn10": "0312306180", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781466807532", "binding": "print"}]}}
