{"book": {"publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "synopsis": "Pearl S. Buck was one of the most renowned, interesting, and controversial figures ever to influence American and Chinese cultural and literary history--and yet she remains one of the least studied, honored, or remembered. In this richly illustrated and meticulously crafted narrative, Conn recounts Buck\"s life in absorbing detail, tracing the parallel course of American and Chinese history.
