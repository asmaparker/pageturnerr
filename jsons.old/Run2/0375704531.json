{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": ""Beautifully written and--extraordinarily moving."--The Sunday Times (London)<br/><br/>From the author of the international bestseller Birdsong, comes a haunting historical novel of passion, loss, and courage set in France between the two world wars. This Vintage Original edition marks its first appearance in the United States.<br/><br/>On a rainy night in the 1930s, Anne Louvet appears at the run-down Hotel du Lion d\"Or in the village of Janvilliers. She is seeking a job and a new life, one far removed from the awful injustices of her past. As Anne embarks on a torrential love affair with a married veteran of the Great War, The Girl at the Lion d\'Or fashions an unbreakable spell of narrative and atmosphere that evokes French masters from Flaubert to Renoir.<br/><br/>'This moving and profound novel is perfectly constructed, and admirable in its configurations of place and period.'--The Times (London)<br/><br/>'I would urge those who appreciated--The French Lieutenant\'s Woman to try this one--. They may well think it superior.'--Sunday Telegraph (London)', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/36/9780375704536.jpg", "title_long": "The Girl at the Lion d"Or", 'edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.475 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.475}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "1999-12-07", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'British & Irish', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Sebastian Faulks'], 'title": "The Girl at the Lion d"Or", 'isbn13": "9780375704536", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0804153752"}, "isbn": "0375704531", "isbn10": "0375704531", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780804153751", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
