{"book": {"publisher": "CCV", "synopsis": "When the Americans make an offer to buy land in Iceland to build a NATO airbase after World War II, a storm of protest is provoked throughout the country. The airbase provides Laxness with the catalyst for his astonishing and powerful satire. Narrated by a country girl from the north, the novel follows her experiences after she takes up employment as a maid in the house of her Member of Parliament. Marvelling at the customs and behaviour of the people around her, she emerges as the one obstinate reality in a world of unreality. Her observations and experiences expose the bourgeois society of the south as rootless and shallow and in stark contrast to the age-old culture of the solid and less fanciful north. A witty and moving satire on politics and politicians, Communists and anti-Communists, phoney culture fiends, big business and all the pretensions of authority, Laxness" masterpiece of social commentary is as relevant today as when it was written in 1948.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/51/58/9780099455158.jpg", "title_long": "The Atom Station", "edition": "New Ed", "dimensions": "Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Weight: 0.38801358112 Pounds, Width: 0.59055 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1181}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.59055}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.38801358112}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.79526}}, "pages": 204, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Halldor Laxness'], 'title": "The Atom Station", "isbn13": "9780099455158", "msrp": 17.75, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0099455153", "isbn10": "0099455153"}}
