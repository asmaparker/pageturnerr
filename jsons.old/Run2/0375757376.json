Huck, in flight from his murderous father, and Jim, in flight from slavery, pilot their raft through treacherous waters, surviving a crash with a steamboat and betrayal by rogues. As Norman Mailer has said, “The mark of how good Huckleberry Finn has to be is that one can compare it to a number of our best modern American novels and it stands up page for page.”", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/72/9780375757372.jpg", "title_long": "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Modern Library Classics)", "edition": "Modern Library", "dimensions": "Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.21 Inches, Weight: 0.54895103238 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.21}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.54895103238}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.95}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2001-08-14", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Classics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Mark Twain'], 'title": "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Modern Library Classics)", "isbn13": "9780375757372", "msrp": 8, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375757376", "isbn10": "0375757376", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780553897425", "binding": "print"}]}}
