{"book": {"publisher": "Harpercollins Publishers", "synopsis": "Reissue of the author"s most famous and well-loved work, the Starbridge series, six self-contained yet interconnected novels that explore the history of the Church of England through the 20th century. Jon Darrow, a man with psychic powers, is a man who has played many parts: a shady faith-healer; a naval chaplain, a passionate husband, an awkward father, an Anglo-Catholic monk. In 1940 Darrow returns to the world he once renounced, but faced with many unforeseen temptations he fails to control his psychic, most glamorous powers. Corruption lies in wait for him, and threatens not only his future as a priest but his happiness with Anne, the young woman he has come to love.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/69/22/9780006496922.jpg", "title_long": "Glamorous Powers.
