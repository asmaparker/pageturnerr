{"book": {"publisher": "HarperOne", "synopsis": "When You Love, You Change the World<br/>Why is it that we destroy the things we love most? This is the question Paulo Coelho faces in this touching story about his confrontation with his past. In The Valkyries, Paulo and his wife, Cristina, embark on a forty-day quest into the starkly beautiful and sometimes dangerous Mojave Desert, where they encounter the Valkyries, strange warrior women who travel the desert on motorcycles. A masterful blend of the exotic locales, dramatic adventure, and stark storytelling for which Coelhoâ€™s fictional works are renowned, this true-life odyssey is at once a modern-day adventure story and a poignant message about letting go of the past and believing in the future.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/33/42/9780062513342.jpg", "title_long": "The Valkyries", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2021-08-03", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Women's Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["Paulo Coelho'], 'title": "The Valkyries", "isbn13": "9780062513342", "msrp": 16.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0061842869"}, "isbn": "0062513346", "isbn10": "0062513346", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061842863", "binding": "print"}]}}
