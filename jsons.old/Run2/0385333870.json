{"book": {"publisher": "Dial Press Trade Paperback", "synopsis": "“A madcap genealogical adventure . . . Vonnegut is a postmodern Mark Twain.”—The New York Times Book Review<br/><br/>Galápagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Galápagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race. In this inimitable novel, America’ s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry–and all that is worth saving.<br/><br/>Praise for Galápagos<br/><br/>“The best Vonnegut novel yet!”—John Irving<br/><br/>“Beautiful . . . provocative, arresting reading.”—USA Today<br/><br/>“A satire in the classic tradition . . . a dark vision, a heartfelt warning.”—The Detroit Free Press<br/><br/>“Interesting, engaging, sad and yet very funny . . . Vonnegut is still in top form. If he has no prescription for alleviating the pain of the human condition, at least he is a first-rate diagnostician.”—Susan Isaacs, Newsday<br/><br/>“Dark . . . original and funny.”—People<br/><br/>“A triumph of style, originality and warped yet consistent logic . . . a condensation, an evolution of Vonnegut’s entire career, including all the issues and questions he has pursued relentlessly for four decades.”—The Philadelphia Inquirer<br/><br/>“Wild details, wry humor, outrageous characters . . . Galápagos is a comic lament, a sadly ironic vison.”—St. Louis Post-Dispatch<br/><br/>“A work of high comedy, sadness and imagination.”—The Denver Post<br/><br/>“Wacky wit and irreverent imagination . . . and the full range of technical innovations have made [Vonnegut] America’s preeminent experimental novelist.”—The Minneapolis Star and Tribune", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/70/9780385333870.jpg", "title_long": "Galapagos: A Novel (Delta Fiction)", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 8.01 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.67 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.23}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.67}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.01}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "1999-01-12", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Science & Math', 'Evolution', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Anthologies', 'Science Fiction', 'Post-Apocalyptic', 'Humorous', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Kurt Vonnegut'], 'title": "Galapagos: A Novel (Delta Fiction)", "isbn13": "9780385333870", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0440339081"}, "isbn": "0385333870", "isbn10": "0385333870", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780440339083", "binding": "print"}]}}
