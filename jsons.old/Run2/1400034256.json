{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "From the acclaimed Nobel Prize winner: At the close of the 17th century, Iceland is an oppressed Danish colony, suffering under extreme poverty, famine, and plague. A farmer and accused cord-thief named Jon Hreggvidsson makes a bawdy joke about the Danish king and soon after finds himself a fugitive charged with the murder of the king’s hangman.<br/><br/>In the years that follow, the hapless but resilient rogue Hreggvidsson becomes a pawn entangled in political and personal conflicts playing out on a far grander scale. Chief among these is the star-crossed love affair between Snaefridur, known as “Iceland’s Sun,” a beautiful, headstrong young noblewoman, and Arnas Arnaeus, the king’s antiquarian, an aristocrat whose worldly manner conceals a fierce devotion to his downtrodden countrymen. As their personal struggle plays itself out on an international stage, Laxness creates a Dickensian canvas of heroism and venality, violence and tragedy, charged with narrative enchantment on every page.<br/><br/>Sometimes grim, sometimes uproarious, and always captivating, Iceland"s Ball is at once an updating of the traditional Icelandic saga and a caustic social satire.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/53/9781400034253.jpg", "title_long": "Iceland"s Bell", 'edition": "4th", "dimensions": "Height: 7.94 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.72 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.16}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.93}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.72}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.94}}, "pages": 448, "date_published": "2003-10-14", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Halldor Laxness'], 'title": "Iceland"s Bell", 'isbn13": "9781400034253", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307426319", "ePub": "0307426319"}, "isbn": "1400034256", "isbn10": "1400034256", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307426314", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
