[Powers is
        ] a novelist of ideas and a novelist of witness, and in both respects, he has few American peers.” — Richard Eder, Los Angeles Times<br/><br/>In the spring of 1914, renowned photographer August Sander took a photograph of three young men on their way to a country dance. This haunting image, capturing the last moments of innocence on the brink of World War I, provides the central focus of Powers’s brilliant and compelling novel.<br/>As the fate of the three farmers is chronicled, two contemporary stories unfold. The young narrator becomes obsessed with the photo, while Peter Mays, a computer writer in Boston, discovers he has a personal link with it. The three stories connect in a surprising way and offer the reader a glimpse into a mystery that spans a century of brutality and progress.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/50/98/9780060975098.jpg", "title_long": "Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 0.9 Inches, Length: 7.96 Inches, Weight: 0.69 Pounds, Width: 5.52 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.96}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.52}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.69}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.9}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2001-05-08", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Alternate History', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Richard Powers'], 'title": "Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance", "isbn13": "9780060975098", "msrp": 15.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060975091", "isbn10": "0060975091", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780063119451", "binding": "ebook"}]}}
