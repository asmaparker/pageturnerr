Seeming to preside over this nightmarish world is the diabolical Judge Holden, one of the most unforgettable characters in American fiction.<br/><br/>Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, Blood Meridian represents a genius vision of the historical West, one whose stature has only grown in the years since its publication.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/49/9780679641049.jpg", "title_long": "Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West (Modern Library (Hardcover))", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.68 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.68}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.10010668738}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2001-01-02", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Westerns', 'Action & Adventure', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Cormac McCarthy'], 'title": "Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West (Modern Library (Hardcover))", "isbn13": "9780679641049", "msrp": 23, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0679641041", "isbn10": "0679641041"}}
