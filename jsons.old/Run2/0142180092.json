{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "A dazzling meditation on love and honor, greed and generosity, passion and death, from the Booker Prize-winning author of The Sea, The Sea<br/><br/>Set in London and in the South of France, this brilliantly structured novel centers on two women: Gertrude Openshaw, bereft from the recent death of her husband, yet awakening to passion; and Anne Cavidge, who has returned in doubt from many years in a nunnery, only to encounter her personal Christ. A fascinating array of men and women hover in urgent orbit around them: the "Count," a lonely Pole obsessively reliving his émigré father\"s patriotic anguish; Tim Reede, a seedy yet appealing artist, and Daisy, his mistress; the manipulative Mrs. Mount; and many other magically drawn characters moving between desire and obligation, guilt and joy. This edition of Nuns and Soldiers includes a new introduction by renowned religious historian Karen Armstrong.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/00/99/9780142180099.jpg", "title_long": "Nuns and Soldiers (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 1.2 Inches, Length: 7.7 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.7}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.9}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.2}}, "pages": 512, "date_published": "2002-07-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Iris Murdoch'], 'title": "Nuns and Soldiers (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)", "isbn13": "9780142180099", "msrp": 22, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101494263"}, "isbn": "0142180092", "isbn10": "0142180092", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101494264", "binding": "print"}]}}
