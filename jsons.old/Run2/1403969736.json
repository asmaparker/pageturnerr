{"book": {"publisher": "Palgrave Macmillan", "synopsis": "J.R.R. Tolkien delved into the Middle Ages to create a critique of the modern world in his fantasy, yet did so in a form of modernist literature with postmodern implications and huge commercial success. These essays examine that paradox and its significance in understanding the intersection between traditionalist and counter-culture criticisms of the modern. The approach helps to explain the popularity of his works, the way in which they continue to be brought into dialogue with Twenty-First century issues, and their contested literary significance in the academy.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/36/9781403969736.jpg", "title_long": "Tolkien"s Modern Middle Ages (The New Middle Ages)", "edition": "2008", "dimensions": "Height: 8.58 Inches, Length: 6.08 Inches, Weight: 1.0802650838 Pounds, Width: 0.74 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.08}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.74}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.0802650838}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.58}}, "pages": 264, "date_published": "2008-03-26", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Movements & Periods', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": [], "title": "Tolkien"s Modern Middle Ages (The New Middle Ages)", 'isbn13": "9781403969736", "msrp": 109.99, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1403969736", "isbn10": "1403969736"}}
