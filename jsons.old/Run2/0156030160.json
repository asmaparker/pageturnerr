{"book": {"publisher": "HarperVia", "synopsis": "Yochanan Rivlin, a professor at Haifa University, is a man of boundless and often na√Øve curiosity. His wife, Hagit, a district judge, is tolerant of almost everything but her husband"s faults and prevarications. Frequent arguments aside, they are a well-adjusted couple with two grown sons.<br/>When one of Rivlin"s students-a young Arab bride from a village in the Galilee-is assigned to help with his research in recent Algerian history, a two-pronged mystery develops. As they probe the causes of the bloody Algerian civil war, Rivlin also becomes obsessed with his son"s failed marriage.<br/>Rivlin's search leads to a number of improbable escapades. In this comedy of manners, at once deeply serious and highly entertaining, Yehoshua brilliantly portrays characters from disparate sectors of Israeli life, united above all by a very human desire for, and fear of, the truth in politics and life.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/68/9780156030168.jpg", "title_long": "The Liberated Bride", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 1.4 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 5.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.4}}, "pages": 568, "date_published": "2004-10-04", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'World Literature', 'Jewish', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["A.B.
