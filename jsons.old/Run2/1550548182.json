{"book": {"publisher": "Douglas & McIntyre", "synopsis": "Eclectic and provocative, this book, designed to resemble a Japanese underground zine, looks at Vancouver from inside out, from the Grouse Grind to the shimmering glass towers, First Nations to feng-shui. Douglas Coupland takes on monster houses, weather, Sandra Bernhard, Love Boats, SkyTrain, fleece, that endless rivalry with Seattle, and even includes a short story about living in a low-rent Granville hotel. Over 100 archival photographs, maps, and \x93beauty shots” add to the fun in this witty survey by the noted chronicler of alternative culture.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/81/9781550548181.jpg", "title_long": "City of Glass: Doug Coupland"s Vancouver", "edition": "Canadian First", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 152, "date_published": "2003-05-01", "subjects": ["Travel', 'Canada', 'Cities', 'United States', 'West', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors": ["Douglas Coupland'], 'title": "City of Glass: Doug Coupland"s Vancouver", 'isbn13": "9781550548181", "msrp": 16.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1550548182", "isbn10": "1550548182"}}
