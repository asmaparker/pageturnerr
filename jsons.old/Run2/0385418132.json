{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "This definitive illustrated survey of all of Alfred Hitchcock"s films is a book no movie buff or Hitchcock fan can afford to be without.<br/><br/>The monumental scope of Alfred Hitchcock"s work remains unsurpassed by any other movie director, past or present. So many of his movies have achieved classic status that even a partial list—Psycho, The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo, Spellbound—brings a flood of memories. In this essential text, reissued on the occasion of Hitchcock"s centennial, internationally renowned Hitchcock authority Donald Spoto describes and analyzes every movie made by this master filmmaker. Illustrated throughout with shots from each film, The Art of Alfred Hitchcock also includes a storyboard section, a complete filmography, and “A Hitchcock Album” (sixteen pages of photos) as an added celebration of his life.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/33/9780385418133.jpg", "title_long": "The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures", "edition": "Subsequent", "dimensions": "Height: 9.26 Inches, Length: 6.02 Inches, Weight: 1.22577017672 Pounds, Width: 1.11 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.02}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.11}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.22577017672}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.26}}, "pages": 496, "date_published": "1991-12-01", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Individual Directors', 'Photography & Video', 'Film & Video Art', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Movie Directors', 'Theatre', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Direction & Production', 'History & Criticism', 'Video', 'Theory'], 'authors": ["Donald Spoto'], 'title": "The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures", "isbn13": "9780385418133", "msrp": 26, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307567141", "ePub": "0307567141"}, "isbn": "0385418132", "isbn10": "0385418132", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307567147", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
