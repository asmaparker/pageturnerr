{"book": {"publisher": "Avon", "synopsis": "That hot guy tied to Lissianna Argeneau’s bed? He’s not dessert—he’s the main course!<br/>Lissianna has been spending her centuries pining for Mr. Right, not just a quick snack, and this sexy guy she finds in her bed looks like he might be a candidate. But there’s another, more pressing issue: her tendency to faint at the sight of blood . . . an especially annoying quirk for a vampire. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that this man has a delicious-looking neck. What kind of cold-blooded vampire woman could resist a bite of that?<br/>Dr. Gregory Hewitt recovers from the shock of waking up in a stranger’s bedroom pretty quickly—once he sees a gorgeous woman about to treat him to a wild night of passion. But is it possible for the good doctor to find true love with a vampire vixen, or will he be just a good meal? That’s a question Dr. Greg might be willing to sink his teeth into . . . if he can just get Lissianna to bite.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/37/55/9780060773755.jpg", "title_long": "A Quick Bite (Argeneau Vampires, Book 1)", "edition": "Argeneau Vampires, Book 1", "dimensions": "Height: 6.62 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.40565056208 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.04}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.40565056208}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.62}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "2020-03-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Paranormal', 'Vampires', 'Gothic', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Romantic', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Lynsay Sands'], 'title": "A Quick Bite (Argeneau Vampires, Book 1)", "isbn13": "9780060773755", "msrp": 4.74, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "006175062X", "ePub": "006175062X"}, "isbn": "0060773758", "isbn10": "0060773758", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061750625", "binding": "print"}]}}
