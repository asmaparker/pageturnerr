{"book": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "synopsis": "What would life be like without the state? What justifies the state? Who should rule? How much liberty should the citizen enjoy? How should property be justly distributed? This book examines the central problems involved in political philosophy and the past attempts to respond to these problems. Jonathan Wolff looks at the works of Plato, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Mill, Marx, and Rawls (among others), examining how the debates between philosophers have developed, and searching for possible answers to these provocative questions. His final chapter looks at more recent issues, particularly feminist political theory.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/95/9780199296095.jpg", "title_long": "An Introduction to Political Philosophy", "edition": "Revised", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 228, "date_published": "2006-03-23", "subjects": ["Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Political', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Jonathan Wolff'], 'title": "An Introduction to Political Philosophy", "isbn13": "9780199296095", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "019929609X", "isbn10": "019929609X"}}
