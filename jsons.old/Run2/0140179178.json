Unfulfilled by the excess of fame and fortune his revolutionary image has wrought, he bolts from his band mid-tour to hole up in a dingy East Village apartment and separate himself from the paranoid machine that propels the culture he has helped create. As faithful fans await messages, Bucky encounters every sort of roiling farce he is trying to escape.
