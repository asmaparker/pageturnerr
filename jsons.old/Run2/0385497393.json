{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "In 1971, a man calling himself D.B. Cooper hijacked a flight, claimed his ransom without harming a soul, and vanished. Elwood Reid uses this true story as a starting point, imagining Cooper as Phil Fitch, a Vietnam vet with a failed marriage who decides the time has come to do something that will save him from a life of punching timecards and wondering what could have been. Fitch ends up in Mexico, where he drifts until a bad turn of luck forces him to return home.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, newly retired FBI agent Frank Marshall is struggling with his new life of leisure–fishing, spending time with family, and drinking too much. Unable to let go of a few old cases, Marshall decides to help a young agent determined to solve the mystery of D. B. Cooper. As they close in and events bring Fitch back home, these two stories head for a moving climax in a smart, gripping, and frequently hilarious tale of one of America’s modern folk heroes.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/98/9780385497398.jpg", "title_long": "D.B.: A Novel", "dimensions": "Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.23}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.59965735264}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.97}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2005-07-12", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Men's Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Romance', 'Women's Adventure', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Elwood Reid'], 'title": "D.B.: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780385497398", "msrp": 14.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307275086"}, "isbn": "0385497393", "isbn10": "0385497393", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307275080", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
