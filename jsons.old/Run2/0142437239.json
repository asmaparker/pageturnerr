In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, these exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote"s fancy often leads him astray—he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants—Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together-and together they have haunted readers" imaginations for nearly four hundred years.<br/><br/>With its experimental form and literary playfulness, Don Quixote has been generally recognized as the first modern novel.
