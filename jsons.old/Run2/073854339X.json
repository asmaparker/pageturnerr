{"book": {"publisher": "Arcadia Publishing", "synopsis": "Florida\"s first theme park, Cypress Gardens, was the brainchild of Richard Downing Dick" Pope Sr. With his wife, Julie Downing Pope, he transformed a marshy, lakeside property in Winter Haven into a magnificent garden. The park\"s first visitors in 1936 toured pathways surrounded by lush plants from around the world. Two years later, electric boats meandered through the park\'s winding, hand-dug canals. Water ski shows commenced in 1942, and the park became the 'Water Ski Capital of the World.' The Florida-shaped Esther Williams Swimming Pool still graces the shore of Lake Eloise. The park was a set for dozens of short feature films, a stage for beauty pageants, and a site for special television broadcasts. A butterfly garden, zoo, rides, and the small-town Southern Crossroads shopping and dining area remain popular features. Kent Buescher purchased Cypress Gardens in 2004, and today\'s expanded Cypress Gardens Adventure Park preserves the family-friendly appeal of Dick and Julie Pope\'s magnificent park.'', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/90/9780738543390.jpg", "title_long": "Cypress Gardens, FL (Images of America)", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.72 Pounds, Width: 0.31 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.31}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.72}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2006-11-21", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Photography & Video', 'Travel', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Specialty Travel', 'Tourist Destinations & Museums', 'Adventure', 'Theme Parks'], 'authors": ['Mary M.
