{"book": {"publisher": "Fawcett", "synopsis": "Eighteen-year-old Eddie Nye was bound for U.S.C. and a bright future that fateful summer in the Bahamas. But somebody set Eddie up. Instead of four years of higher education, he did fifteen behind bars for drug smuggling. Eddie went in innocent, but with three prison murders under his belt, he comes out dangerous. Although all he wants is to stay clean, Eddie’s future won’t be that easy. The nightmares of his past—corruption, greed, and most of all a stunning betrayal—are on a collision course with a daring plot hatched in a prison cell. To learn the secret of his own life, half-hidden in an ancient mariner’s saga, Eddie must face the hardest choice a free man can make.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/80/9780345445780.jpg", "title_long": "Lights Out: A Novel", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2002-06-25", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Peter Abrahams'], 'title": "Lights Out: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780345445780", "msrp": 7.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307777871"}, "isbn": "0345445783", "isbn10": "0345445783", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307777874", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
