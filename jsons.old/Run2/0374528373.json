{"book": {"publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "synopsis": "Winner of the Pen/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize<br/><br/>The award-winning translation of Fyodor Dostoevsky"s classic novel of psychological realism.<br/><br/>The Brothers Karamasov is a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, and an exploration of erotic rivalry in a series of triangular love affairs involving the “wicked and sentimental” Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov and his three sons―the impulsive and sensual Dmitri; the coldly rational Ivan; and the healthy, red-cheeked young novice Alyosha. Through the gripping events of their story, Dostoevsky portrays the whole of Russian life, is social and spiritual striving, in what was both the golden age and a tragic turning point in Russian culture.<br/><br/>This award-winning translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky remains true to the verbal<br/>inventiveness of Dostoevsky’s prose, preserving the multiple voices, the humor, and the surprising modernity of the original. It is an achievement worthy of Dostoevsky’s last and greatest novel.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/79/9780374528379.jpg", "title_long": "The Brothers Karamazov", "edition": "12th", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 2.06 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.06}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.3}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 824, "date_published": "2002-06-14", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Historical', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Fyodor Dostoevsky'], 'title": "The Brothers Karamazov", "isbn13": "9780374528379", "msrp": 18, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0374528373", "isbn10": "0374528373", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781429927215", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
