She describes the ongoing efforts by the Humane Farming Association to improve conditions in the meatpacking industry, media exposes that have prompted reforms resulting in multimillion dollar appropriations by Congress to try to enforce federal inspection laws, and a favorable decision by the Supreme Court to block construction of what was slated to be one of the largest hog factory farms in the country.Nonetheless, Eisnitz makes it clear that abuses continue and much work still needs to be done', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/07/9781591024507.jpg", "title_long": "Slaughterhouse: The Shocking Story of Greed, Neglect, and Inhumane Treatment Inside the U.S. Meat Industry", "edition": "New Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 0.81 Inches, Length: 6.04 Inches, Weight: 1.19931470528 Pounds, Width: 8.64 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.04}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.64}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.19931470528}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.81}}, "pages": 328, "date_published": "2006-11-01", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Industries', 'Agriculture', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Science & Math', 'Agricultural Sciences', 'Food Science', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Animal Rights', 'Fauna', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Communication & Media Studies', 'Politics & Government', 'Public Affairs & Policy'], 'authors": ["Gail A.
