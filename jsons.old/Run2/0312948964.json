{"book": {"publisher": "St. Martin"s Press", "synopsis": "Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is still learning the ropes at her cousin Vinnie"s bail bond office, so when she sets out on the trail of Kenny Mancuso--a suspiciously wealthy, working class Trenton boy who has just shot his best friend--the stakes are higher than ever. That Mancuso is distantly related to vice cop Joe Morelli--who is trying to beat Stephanie to the punch--only makes the hunt more thrilling….<br/><br/>Taking pointers from her bounty hunter pal, Ranger, and using her pistol-packing Granda Mazur as a decoy, Stephanie is soon closing in on her mark. But Morelli and his libido are worthy foes. And a more sinister kind of enemy has made his first move…and his next move might be Stephanie"s last.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/62/9780312948962.jpg", "title_long": "Two for the Dough (Stephanie Plum, No. 2) (Stephanie Plum Novels)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.68 Inches, Length: 4.23 Inches, Weight: 0.37 Pounds, Width: 0.955 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.23}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.955}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.37}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.68}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2007-05-29", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Janet Evanovich'], 'title": "Two for the Dough (Stephanie Plum, No. 2) (Stephanie Plum Novels)", "isbn13": "9780312948962", "msrp": 6.82, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0312948964", "isbn10": "0312948964"}}
