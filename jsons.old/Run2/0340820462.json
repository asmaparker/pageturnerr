{"book": {"publisher": "New English Library", "synopsis": "In June of 1999, Stephen King was hit by a van while walking along the shoulder of a country road in Maine. Six operations were required to save his life and mend his broken body. When he was finally able to sit up, he immediately started writing. This book is the extraordinary result.<br/><br/>He tells readers about what books and films influenced him as a young writer, his first idea for a story, and the true-life tale that inspired "Carrie". For the first time, here\"s an intimate autobiographical portrait of his home life, his family, and his traumatic accident. Citing examples of his work and those of his contemporaries, King gives an excellent masterclass on writing - how to use the tools of the trade from building characters to pace and plotting as well as practical advice on presentation. And he tells readers how he got to be a No. 1 bestseller for a quarter of a century with fascinating descriptions of his own process, the origins and development of, for example, 'Carrie' and 'Misery.'', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/69/9780340820469.jpg", "title_long": "On Writing", "dimensions": "Height: 1.06299 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Weight: 0.57761112644 Pounds, Width: 7.75589 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1181}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75589}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.57761112644}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.06299}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2001", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing'], 'authors": ['Stephen King'], 'title": "On Writing", "isbn13": "9780340820469", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0340820462", "isbn10": "0340820462"}}
