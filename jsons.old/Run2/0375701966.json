On the eve of his thirtieth birthday, he occupies himself dallying with his secretaries and going to movies, which provide him with the "treasurable moments" absent from his real life. But one fateful Mardi Gras, Binx embarks on a hare-brained quest that outrages his family, endangers his fragile cousin Kate, and sends him reeling through the chaos of New Orleans\" French Quarter. Wry and wrenching, rich in irony and romance, The Moviegoer is a genuine American classic.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/62/9780375701962.jpg", "title_long": "The Moviegoer", "edition": "Later prt.", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.42 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.52}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.42}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 241, "date_published": "1998-04-14", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Literary', 'Travel', 'Europe', 'Greece', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Walker Percy'], 'title": "The Moviegoer", "isbn13": "9780375701962", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375701966", "isbn10": "0375701966"}}
