{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "In sixteen stories, T.C. Boyle tears through the walls of contemporary society to reveal a world at once comic and tragic, droll and horrific. Boyle introduces us to a death-defying stuntman who rides across the country strapped to the axle of a Peterbilt, and to a retired primatologist who can’t adjust to the \x93civilized” world. He chronicles the state of romance that requires full-body protection in a disease-conscious age and depicts with aching tenderness the relationship between a young boy and his alcoholic father. These magical and provocative stories mark yet another virtuoso performance from one of America’s most supple and electric literary inventors.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/95/03/9780140119503.jpg", "title_long": "If the River Was Whiskey: Stories (Contemporary American Fiction)", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "1990-05-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["T.C.
