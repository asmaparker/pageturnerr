{"book": {"publisher": "Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co", "synopsis": "For Calculus-based Physics courses. This text is designed for a calculus-based physics course at the beginning university and college level. It is written with the expectation that students have either taken or are currently taking a beginning course in calculus. Students taking a physics course based on this book should leave with a solid conceptual understanding of the fundamental physical laws and how these laws can be applied to solve many problems. The key word for this edition is "understanding." The third edition of this text remains rigorous while including a number of new pedagogical elements which emphasize conceptual understanding.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/29/96/9780130352996.jpg", "title_long": "Physics: for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics, Third Edition", "edition": "3", "dimensions": "Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 6.55654767188 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 6.55654767188}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.75}}, "pages": 1269, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Science & Math', 'Physics', 'Engineering', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Paul M.
