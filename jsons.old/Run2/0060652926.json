{"book": {"publisher": "Harper San Francisco", "synopsis": ""C.S. Lewis is the ideal persuader for the half-convinced, for the good man who would like to be a Christian but finds his intellect getting in the way." — Anthony Burgess, New York Times Book Review<br/>Our moral consciousness and moral judgements are proof to the human race that a moral being exists—God.<br/>Mere Christianity explores the core beliefs of Christianity by providing an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear a powerful, rational case for the Christian faith. A brilliant collection, Mere Christianity remains strikingly fresh for the modern reader and at the same time confirms C. S. Lewis’s reputation as one of the leading writer and thinkers of our age.<br/>The book brings together Lewis’ legendary broadcast talks during World War II. Lewis discusses that everyone is curious about: right and wrong, human nature, morality, marriage, sins, forgiveness, faith, hope, generosity, and kindness.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/29/20/9780060652920.jpg", "title_long": "Mere Christianity", "edition": "Revised & Enlarged", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.43431065614 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.64}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.43431065614}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 227, "date_published": "2001-02-06", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Personal Growth', 'Theology', 'Apologetics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["C.
