{"book": {"publisher": "Association for Scottish Literary Studies", "synopsis": "Iain Banks was one of Scotland"s most inventive writers, producing an extraordinary range of work, from family sagas set in present-day Scotland to science fiction spanning vast gulfs of space and time. He enjoyed breaking the arbitrary boundaries of genre, and often created narratives blending “realistic” storylines with fantastical elements.<br/><br/>Alan MacGillivray’s Scotnote provides an overview of Iain Banks’s fiction, and focuses on three novels in particular: The Wasp Factory, a darkly comic piece of Scottish Gothic fiction; The Crow Road, a cross-generational family saga with elements of a detective story; and Whit, following the adventures of an innocent thrust into modern society.
