{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial", "synopsis": "In Fabulous Small Jews, the best-selling author Joseph Epstein has produced eighteen charming, magical, and finely detailed stories. They are populated by lawyers, professors, scrap-iron dealers, dry cleaners, all men of a certain age who feel themselves adrift in the radically changed values of the day. Epstein"s richly drawn characters are at various crossroads and turning points in their lives: bitter Seymour Hefferman, who anonymously sends scathing postcards to writers until he gets caught; Moe Bernstein, who, inspired by his grandson, decides to attend to his own health after long delay; divorc√© Artie Glick, who wants to marry his pregnant girlfriend. Fabulous Small Jews is a marvelous collection from a master of the short form.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/82/9780618446582.jpg", "title_long": "Fabulous Small Jews", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.91}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2004-07-06", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', '20th Century', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Joseph Epstein'], 'title": "Fabulous Small Jews", "isbn13": "9780618446582", "msrp": 19.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Page Fidelity": "0547526741", "eBook": "0547526741"}, "isbn": "0618446583", "isbn10": "0618446583", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780547526744", "binding": "print"}]}}
