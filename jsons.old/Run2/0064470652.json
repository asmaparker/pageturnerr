{"book": {"publisher": "HarperTeen", "synopsis": "Once upon a time in the city of Shangri-L.A., someone left a baby on a doorstep. She had wild, dark hair and purple eyes and looked at the world in a special way.<br/><br/>The family that took her in called her Witch Baby and raised her as their own. But even though she tried to fit in, Witch Baby never felt as though she truly belonged.<br/><br/>So one day she packed her bat-shaped backpack, put her black cowboy-boot roller skates, and went out into the real world to find out who she really was....<br/>"[In] this sequel to the extraordinary Weetzie Bat, Witch Baby is at odds with her complicated family.She\"s a glowering personality whose excesses trouble both herself and others. Still, Witch Baby\"s quest for meaning ends on an up beat [and] generosity and love triumph in a far-from-perfect world. [Block uses] exquisitely crafted language to tell a story whose glitzy surface veils thoughtful consideration of profound contemporary themes.' \x97SLJ.<br/>1992 Recommended Books for Reluctant Young Adult Readers (ALA)<br/>Best Books of 1991 (SLJ)<br/>1992 Books for the Teen Age (NY Public Library)', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/06/50/9780064470650.jpg", "title_long": "Witch Baby (Weetzie Bat, 2)", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.15 Pounds, Width: 0.26 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.26}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.15}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "1992-10-30", "subjects": ["Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Social Issues', 'Romance'], 'authors": ["Francesca Lia Block'], 'title": "Witch Baby (Weetzie Bat, 2)", "isbn13": "9780064470650", "msrp": 5.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0064470652", "isbn10": "0064470652"}}
