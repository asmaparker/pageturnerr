{"book": {"publisher": "DAW", "synopsis": "Magnus Ridolph, at first glance, did not look like an interstellar troubleshooter. He was not tall and muscular, his skin had not been turned to a rugged color by the numerous distant suns he had visited, and his voice and manner seemed far too mild for an adventurer. Yet there was a chill hardness in his mild blue eyes that warned of the deceptiveness in his appearance.<br/><br/>Throughout the galaxy, there were men and other beings - Yellowbirds, Tau Gemini ant-things, Hecatian anthropes - who could testify to the deadliness that lurked behind those eyes.<br/><br/>In Magnus Ridolph, Jack Vance has created one of the most memorable characters of his award-winning career.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/19/9780879975319.jpg", "title_long": "The Many Worlds of Magnus Ridolph", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 5 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}}, "pages": 174, "date_published": "1980-04-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors": ['Jack Vance'], 'title": "The Many Worlds of Magnus Ridolph", "isbn13": "9780879975319", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0879975318", "isbn10": "0879975318"}}
