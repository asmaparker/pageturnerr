{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": ""One of the greatest love stories in world literature" Vladimir Nabokov<br/><br/>The heroine of Tolstoy"s epic of love and self-destruction, Anna Karenina has beauty, wealth, popularity and an adored son, but feels that her life is empty until she encounters the impetuous officer Count Vronsky. Their subsequent affair scandalizes society and family alike, and brings jealousy and bitterness in its wake. Contrasting with this is the vividly observed story of Levin, a man striving to find contentment and a meaning to his life - and also a self-portrait of Tolstoy himself. This award-winning translation has been acclaimed as the definitive English version of Tolstoy's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Translated by RICHARD PEVEAR and LARISSA VOLOKHONSKY with a Preface by JOHN BAYLEY', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/91/74/9780140449174.jpg", "title_long": "Anna Karenina (Penguin Classics)", "edition": "Revised", "dimensions": "Height: 7.76 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 1.2897042327 Pounds, Width: 1.51 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.51}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.2897042327}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.76}}, "pages": 880, "date_published": "2002-12-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet'], 'authors": ["Leo Tolstoy'], 'title": "Anna Karenina (Penguin Classics)", "isbn13": "9780140449174", "msrp": 13.56, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140449175", "isbn10": "0140449175"}}
