{"book": {"publisher": "Scribner", "synopsis": "The true story of a boy whose life was saved by literature, Hamlet\"s Dresser is a portrait of a person made whole by art. Bob Smith\"s childhood was a fragile and lonely one, spent largely caring for his handicapped sister, Carolyn. But at age ten, his local librarian gave him a copy of Shakespeare\"s The Merchant of Venice, and it transformed him. In Bob\'s first look at Shakespeare\'s penetrating language -- 'In sooth I know not why I am so sad' -- he had found a window through which to view the world. Years later, when the American Shakespeare Festival moved into Stratford and Smith was hired as Hamlet\'s dresser, his life\'s passion took shape.<br/>Blending tragedy and comedy, Smith gracefully weaves together his childhood memories with his experiences backstage and teaching the plays. The result is a gorgeous, tender, infectious book about the restorative powers of literature and art.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/06/9780684852706.jpg", "title_long": "Hamlet"s Dresser: A Memoir", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.58}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "2003-02-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Educators', 'Regional U.S.', 'New England', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Bob Smith'], 'title": "Hamlet"s Dresser: A Memoir", 'isbn13": "9780684852706", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0684852705", "isbn10": "0684852705"}}
