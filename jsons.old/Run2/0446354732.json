{"book": {"publisher": "Grand Central Publishing", "synopsis": "Three young doctors-their hopes, their dreams, their unexpected desires... Dr. Paige Taylor: She swore it was euthanasia, but when Paige inherited a million dollars from a patient, the D.A. called it murder. Dr. Kat Hunter: She vowed never to let another man too close again-until she accepted the challenge of a deadly bet. Dr. Honey Taft: To make it in medicine, she knew she"d need something more than the brains God gave her. Racing from the life-and-death decisions of a big major hospital to the tension-packed fireworks of a murder trial, Nothing Lasts Forever lays bare the ambitions and fears of healers and killers, lovers and betrayers. And proves once again that no reader can outguess Sidney Sheldon, the master of the unexpected.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/38/9780446354738.jpg", "title_long": "Nothing Lasts Forever", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.875 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 1.125 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.125}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.43}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.875}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "1995-09-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Sidney Sheldon'], 'title": "Nothing Lasts Forever", "isbn13": "9780446354738", "msrp": 7.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0446354732", "isbn10": "0446354732"}}
