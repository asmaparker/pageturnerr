{"book": {"publisher": "Modern Library", "synopsis": "Nominated for a National Book Critics Circle award, Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs gathers together Wallace Stegner’s most important and memorable writings on the American West: its landscapes, diverse history, and shifting identity; its beauty, fragility, and power. With subjects ranging from the writer’s own “migrant childhood” to the need to protect what remains of the great western wilderness (which Stegner dubs “the geography of hope”) to poignant profiles of western writers such as John Steinbeck and Norman Maclean, this collection is a riveting testament to the power of place. At the same time it communicates vividly the sensibility and range of this most gifted of American writers, historians, and environmentalists.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/21/9780375759321.jpg", "title_long": "Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs: Living and Writing in the West (Modern Library Classics)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.06 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.51147244784 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.51147244784}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.06}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2002-04-09", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'United States', 'Anthologies', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Wallace Stegner'], 'title": "Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs: Living and Writing in the West (Modern Library Classics)", "isbn13": "9780375759321", "msrp": 18, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375759328", "isbn10": "0375759328"}}
