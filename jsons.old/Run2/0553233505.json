Camp Thin-na-Yet is all about losing weight, and it\"s even worse than he\'d imagined.<br/><br/>Between 'active rest,' 'swim \'n\' trim,' 'slimnastics,' and cabin brawls, there\'s hardly a minute to relax. The portion-controlled meals taste worse than the foil they come wrapped in, the low-cal bug juice is so repulsive even bugs won\'t go near it, and there are no second helpings of anything but water. The skinny counselors confiscate hidden candy hoards and keep their own food under lock and key. And the big treat at the Saturday night dance is unlimited celery sticks.<br/><br/>Is there any way out? Sam can\'t seem to find one. Then he meets fellow sufferer Belinda Moss and helps her stage an ill-fated raid on one of the counselors\' cabins. Belinda and Sam soon agree there\'s only one good way to deal with the penitentiary called Camp Thin-na-Yet: escape. But that\'s not as easy as it sounds.<br/><br/>Praise for Slim Down Camp:<br/><br/>' . . . spiced with engaging humor . . . wry and breezy . . .'<br/>--The New York Times<br/><br/>'Brisk, humorous, and true to adolescent agonizing . . .
