{"book": {"publisher": "Ecco", "synopsis": "Between 1987 and 1989, Paul Bowles, at the suggestion of a friend, kept a journal to record the daily events of his life. What emerges is not only just a record of the meals, conversations, and health concerns of the author of The Sheltering Sky but also a fascinating look at an artist at work in a new medium. Characterized by a refreshing informality, clear-sightedness, and passages of exquisite prose, these pages record with equal fascination the behavior of an itinerant spider, a brutal episode of violence in a Tangier marketplace, and the pageantry and excess of Malcolm Forbes"s seventieth birthday party. In Days, a master observer of the foreign and obscure turns his attentions toward his own daily existence, giving us a startlingly candid portrait of his life in late twentieth-century Tangier.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/73/65/9780061137365.jpg", "title_long": "Days: A Tangier Diary", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.24 Pounds, Width: 0.29 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.29}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.24}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2006-06-13", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Diaries & Journals', 'Travel', 'Africa', 'Morocco', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Paul Bowles'], 'title": "Days: A Tangier Diary", "isbn13": "9780061137365", "msrp": 14.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0061137367", "isbn10": "0061137367"}}
