Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018.<br/><br/>Coetzee grew up in a new development north of Cape Town, tormented by guilt and fear. With a father he despised, and a mother he both adored and resented, he led a double life—the brilliant and well-behaved student at school, the princely despot at home, always terrified of losing his mother\'s love. His first encounters with literature, the awakenings of sexual desire, and a growing awareness of apartheid left him with baffling questions; and only in his love of the high veld ('farms are places of freedom, of life') could he find a sense of belonging. Bold and telling, this masterly evocation of a young boy\'s life is the book Coetzee\'s many admirers have been waiting for, but never could have expected.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/56/68/9780140265668.jpg", "title_long": "Boyhood: Scenes from Provincial Life", "dimensions": "Height: 5.1 Inches, Length: 0.5 Inches, Weight: 0.32 Pounds, Width: 0.43 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.43}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.32}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}}, "pages": 166, "date_published": "1998-09-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Historical', 'Africa', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'South Africa', 'Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'African', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["J.
