{"book": {"publisher": "Classic Publishing Corporation", "synopsis": "The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch & Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br/><br/>Scott created these drawings in scratchboard an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.<br/><br/>Every child loves a story about a horse, and Black Beauty remains one of the finest, most touching ever written. Set in Victorian London, the novel follows the shifting fortunes of a horse as he moves from owner to owner. Narrated by the noble Black Beauty himself, the tale offers an animalâ€™s perspective of the world, and highlights the thoughtless, even cruel treatment animals endured during that period.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/28/9781402714528.jpg", "title_long": "BLACK BEAUTY HARDCOVER", "edition": "Unknown", "dimensions": "Weight: 0.65 Pounds", "dimensions_structured": {'weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "1970", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors": ["Anna Sewell'], 'title": "BLACK BEAUTY HARDCOVER", "isbn13": "9781402714528", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1402714521", "isbn10": "1402714521", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781402792670", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
