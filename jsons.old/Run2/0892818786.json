{"book": {"publisher": "Healing Arts Press", "synopsis": "Introduce children to the magic of using herbs for healing, cooking, and nature crafts and inspire a lifelong interest in the natural world.<br/><br/>• Designed especially for children ages five to ten.<br/><br/>• A hands-on book for children, filled with fun, easy-to-follow activities.<br/><br/>Walking the World in Wonder covers the medicinal and magical uses of sixty-seven common herbs. Each herb playfully introduces itself and talks about its habitat and many uses. With fun, easy-to-follow activities, herbalist Ellen Evert Hopman teaches children basic herbal skills and invites them to make a sunflower seed mosaic, sew a catnip-filled mouse, and dig for Jerusalem artichoke roots. The book also includes simple recipes that children can use, with adult supervision, to treat minor ailments--peppermint tea to soothe a troubled tummy or horse chestnut salve to heal a scraped knee. Children gain a sense of self-sufficiency and awe for the earth"s treasures by eating wild nettle greens, sprinkling a sandwich with nasturtium flowers, making strawberry honey, and learning to season food with dill they"ve gathered themselves. Parents and teachers will appreciate how these earth-centered activities are placed within a broader social and environmental context. Sixty-seven full-color photographs enable children, parents, and teachers to identify these herbs during walks and field trips. Walking the World in Wonder gives children a direct and joyous experience of their connection to the natural world and inspires a lifelong interest in their own health and that of the planet.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/85/9780892818785.jpg", "title_long": "Walking the World in Wonder: A Children"s Herbal", 'edition": "Original ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 0.00220462262 Pounds, Width: 0.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.00220462262}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10}}, "pages": 160, "date_published": "2000-11", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Health', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Activities, Crafts & Games', 'Activity Books', 'Games'], 'authors": ["Ellen Evert Hopman'], 'title": "Walking the World in Wonder: A Children"s Herbal", 'isbn13": "9780892818785", "msrp": 13.85, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1594775419"}, "isbn": "0892818786", "isbn10": "0892818786", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781594775413", "binding": "print"}]}}
