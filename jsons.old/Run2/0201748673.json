{"book": {"publisher": "Peachpit Pr", "synopsis": "Robin Williams has taught millions what makes for good design and why, never forgetting that most of us don"t speak jargon—and she does it all with a disarming sense of humor. Now Robin, with coauthors John Tollett and Dave Rohr, translates the principles of creative, effective design to the Web in Robin Williams Web Design Workshop. Learn from these pros everything you need to know about Web design, including the ways that color, fonts, clip art, photographs, and layout can work together to create the visual impression you want. Robin doesn"t just tell you about good Web design, she shows you, walking you through every step of the design process, from site planning and layout to navigation design and functionality—the book is illustrated with hundreds of full-color examples. Like Robin herself, Robin Williams Web Design Workshop strikes the perfect teaching balance, combining theory and real-world experience, all wrapped up in a colorful, engaging package.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/73/9780201748673.jpg", "title_long": "Robin Williams Web Design Workshop", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 8.75 Inches, Weight: 1.984160358 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.984160358}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.75}}, "pages": 372, "date_published": "2001", "subjects": ["Computers & Technology', 'Graphics & Design', 'Electronic Documents', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Robin Williams', 'John Tollett', 'David Rohr'], 'title": "Robin Williams Web Design Workshop", "isbn13": "9780201748673", "msrp": 44.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0201748673", "isbn10": "0201748673"}}
