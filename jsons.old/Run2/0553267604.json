When Raymond Feist\"s enormous novel was published, critics called it "the best new fantasy concept in years", and Feist has refined and explored that concept over a dozen novels. His 'concept' was to bring together two (and later, more) whole, intricately realised fantasy worlds. Midkemia is a Tolkienian realm, a European- Medieval series of kingdoms in which magic is prominent, and where men share the earth with dwarves and elves. Feist\'s genius was inventing another sword and sorcercy realm based more closely on eastern models, the Empire of Tsuranuanni, as vast as Ancient China, as formalised and devoted to the arts of war as a samurai Japan. A magical rift in time-space brings these two worlds clashing together, and the young boy Pug and his soldier friend Tomas are thrown into the ensuing maelstrom of invasion and epic battle, before embarking on a more fundamental magical journey towards the very roots of evil itself. Feist\'s two sequels to Magician, Silverthorn and A Darkness at Sethanon complete the richly conceived Riftwar Saga, and Feist has gone on to chronicle other aspects of his invented worlds. With Janny Wurts he wrote the Empire trilogy, which charts the rise, through the rigid patriarchy of the Empire of Tsuranuanni, of a remarkable female heroine, a woman who eventually reaches the heights of the imperial throne itself Daughter of the Empire, Servant of the Empire and Mistress of Empire. More recently he has returned to the world of Medkemia, and to his hero Pug, with the Serpentwar saga, beginning with Shadow of a Dark Queen and continuing with Rise of a Merchant Prince, Rage of a Demon King and Shards of a Broken Crown. Heroic Fantasy is a crowded-enough field, but Feist stands out in it for his sheer inventive power, the scope and range of his narratives, the diversity of his characters and his thundering battle sequences. Start reading here, and you may find yourself unable to stop until you have followed the saga right up to date. --Adam Roberts', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/00/9780553267600.jpg", "title_long": "Magician: Apprentice (The Riftwar Saga, Volume 1)", "edition": "Later Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 6.8 Inches, Length: 1 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 4.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.01}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.8}}, "pages": 323, "date_published": "1985-12-01", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Sword & Sorcery'], 'authors": ['Raymond E.
