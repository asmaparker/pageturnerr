{"book": {"publisher": "Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.", "synopsis": "This edition goes beyond others that largely leave readers to their own devices in understanding this cryptic work, by providing an entr√©e into the text that parallels the traditional Chinese way of approaching it: alongside Slingerland"s exquisite rendering of the work are his translations of a selection of classic Chinese commentaries that shed light on difficult passages, provide historical and cultural context, and invite the reader to ponder a range of interpretations. The ideal student edition, this volume also includes a general introduction, notes, multiple appendices--including a glossary of technical terms, references to modern Western scholarship that point the way for further study, and an annotated bibliography.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/59/9780872206359.jpg", "title_long": "Analects: With Selections from Traditional Commentaries (Hackett Classics)", "edition": "Hackett Classics Series", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.93916923612 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.93916923612}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 312, "date_published": "2003-09", "subjects": ["Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Eastern', 'History & Surveys', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Confucius'], 'title": "Analects: With Selections from Traditional Commentaries (Hackett Classics)", "isbn13": "9780872206359", "msrp": 14.95, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0872206351", "isbn10": "0872206351", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781603840194", "binding": "print"}, {"isbn": "9781603842457", "binding": "print"}]}}
