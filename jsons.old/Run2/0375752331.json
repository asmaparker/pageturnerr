{"book": {"publisher": "Modern Library", "synopsis": "The “Guermantes Way,” in this the third volume of In Search of Lost Time, refers to the path that leads to the Duc and Duchess de Guermantes’s château near Combray. It also represents the narrator’s passage into the rarefied “social kaleidoscope” of the Guermantes’s Paris salon, an important intellectual playground for Parisian society, where he becomes a party to the wit and manners of the Guermantes’s drawing room. Here he encounters nobles, officers, socialites, and assorted consorts, including Robert de Saint Loup and his prostitute mistress Rachel, the Baron de Charlus, and the Prince de Borodino.<br/><br/>For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin’s acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff’s translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of Á la recherché du temps perdu (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade in 1989).", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/39/9780375752339.jpg", "title_long": "In Search of Lost Time, Vol. III: The Guermantes Way", "edition": "MODERN LIB", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 1.27427187436 Pounds, Width: 1.32 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.32}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.27427187436}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 864, "date_published": "1998-11-03", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'World Literature', 'European', 'United States', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Marcel Proust'], 'title": "In Search of Lost Time, Vol. III: The Guermantes Way", "isbn13": "9780375752339", "msrp": 18, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375752331", "isbn10": "0375752331"}}
