{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage UK", "synopsis": "It"s 1989 and, whenever he isn"t hanging out in the local bars, Herr Lehmann lives entirely free of responsibility in the bohemian Berlin district of Kreuzberg. Through years of judicious sidestepping and heroic indolence, this barman has successfully avoided the demands of parents, landlords, neighbours and women. But suddenly one unforeseen incident after another seems to threaten his idyllic and rather peaceable existence. He has an encounter with a decidedly unfriendly dog, his parents threaten to descend on Berlin from the provinces, and he meets a dangerously attractive woman who throws his emotional life into confusion. Berlin Blues is a richly entertaining evocation of life in the city and a classic of modern-day decadence.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/92/32/9780099449232.jpg", "title_long": "Berlin Blues", "dimensions": "Height: 7.6 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.39903669422 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.64}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39903669422}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.6}}, "pages": 249, "date_published": "2003-05-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'British & Irish', 'Contemporary', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference'], 'authors": ["Sven Regener'], 'title": "Berlin Blues", "isbn13": "9780099449232", "msrp": 15.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0099449234", "isbn10": "0099449234"}}
