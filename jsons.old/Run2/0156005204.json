{"book": {"publisher": "Mariner Books", "synopsis": "From José Saramago, Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Baltasar and Blimunda is a “brilliant...enchanting novel” (The New York Times Book Review) of romance, deceit, religion, and magic set in eighteenth-century Portugal at the height of the Inquisition. Portugal, 1711: an amorous friar is pursued naked through the rubble-strewn streets of Lisbon; an enthusiastic procession of flagellants roars with pleasure over the damnation of adultery; a royal prince uses hapless sailors for target practice; and women dressed in colorful finery watch as lapsed converts and sorcerers are put to death by flames. In the midst of the terrors of the Inquisition and the plague, a seemingly mismatched couple discover the wonders of love. This poetic tale, graced with exquisite historical details and full of magic and adventure, is a tapestry of human folly and human will.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/03/9780156005203.jpg", "title_long": "Baltasar and Blimunda", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.993 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.3125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.993}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7495716908}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "1998-11-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Magical Realism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Jose Saramago'], 'title": "Baltasar and Blimunda", "isbn13": "9780156005203", "msrp": 15.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0156005204", "isbn10": "0156005204"}}
