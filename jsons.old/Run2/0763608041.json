{"book": {"publisher": "Candlewick", "synopsis": "Lewis Carroll\"s timeless classic brought to life by one of the most revered children\"s book illustrators of our time!<br/><br/>Suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.<br/><br/>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!'<br/><br/>Lewis Carroll\'s masterpiece, an exuberant mix of fun and fantasy, logic and lunacy, silliness and droll splendor, revolutionized children\'s literature. Its influence has been immeasurable, and the story\'s cast of characters, including Alice herself, the Mad Hatter, and the Cheshire Cat, hold a beloved place in our culture.<br/><br/>Now Helen Oxenbury, one of the world\'s most acclaimed illustrators—whose many books for children include the award-winning FARMER DUCK, by Martin Waddell, as well as her Tom and Pippo books—has brought her own special brand of magic to Lewis Carroll\'s classic.<br/><br/>And ALICE\'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND is Helen Oxenbury at her very best. Her vision of Alice is unique and modern. Her Wonderland is fresh, whimsical, and lovingly created. With more illustrations than any other edition, this beautiful volume has all the warmth, depth of emotion, humor, and acute observations of people and animals for which Helen Oxenbury\'s work is so highly regarded. Join us in celebrating a major artistic achievement! And welcome back—to a Wonderland that is as astonishingly new as it is joyously familiar.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/40/9780763608040.jpg", "title_long": "Alice"s Adventures in Wonderland", 'edition": "First Thus", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 2.4 Pounds, Width: 1.23 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.23}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "1999-10-06", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Classics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Channeling', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Lewis Carroll'], 'title": "Alice"s Adventures in Wonderland", 'isbn13": "9780763608040", "msrp": 24.99, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0763608041", "isbn10": "0763608041"}}
