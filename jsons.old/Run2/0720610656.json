{"book": {"publisher": "Peter Owen Publishers", "synopsis": "In this brilliant adaptation of a novel by the 19th century Greek author Emmanuel Royidis, Lawrence Durrell traces the remarkable history of a young woman who travelled across Europe in the ninth century disguised as a monk, acquired great learning, and ruled over Christendom for two years as Pope John VIII before her sudden and surprising death. When Papissa Joanna was first published in Athens in 1886 it created a sensation. The book was banned and its author excommunicated. It nevertheless brought him immediate fame and the work established itself securely in the history of modern Greek literature. Subsequently Durrell, one of the most important British writers of the 20th century, created a masterpiece in its own right\x97a dazzling concoction presented with the deftest touch.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/59/9780720610659.jpg", "title_long": "Pope Joan (Peter Owen Modern Classic)", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.661386786 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.661386786}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 200, "date_published": "2000-03-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Biographical', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Women's Fiction', 'Literary', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["Lawrence Durrell'], 'title": "Pope Joan (Peter Owen Modern Classic)", "isbn13": "9780720610659", "msrp": 23.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0720610656", "isbn10": "0720610656"}}
