{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "“one of the most important plays of our time” --Howard Taubman, The New York Times<br/><br/>In Vichy France in 1942, eight men and a boy are seized by the collaborationist authorities and made to wait in a building that may be a police station. Some of them are Jews. All of them have something to hide—if not from the Nazis, then from their fellow detainees and, inevitably, from themselves. For in this claustrophobic antechamber to the death camps, everyone is guilty. And perhaps none more so than those who can walk away alive.<br/>In Incident at Vichy, Arthur Miller re-creates Dante"s hell inside the gaping pit that is our history and populates it with sinners whose crimes are all the more fearful because they are so recognizable.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/19/38/9780140481938.jpg", "title_long": "Incident at Vichy: A Play", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.74 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.14991433816 Pounds, Width: 0.24 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.24}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.14991433816}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.74}}, "pages": 80, "date_published": "1985-04-02", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Arthur Miller'], 'title": "Incident at Vichy: A Play", "isbn13": "9780140481938", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101664940"}, "isbn": "0140481931", "isbn10": "0140481931", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101664940", "binding": "print"}]}}
