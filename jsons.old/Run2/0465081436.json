{"book": {"publisher": "Basic Books", "synopsis": "The application of economics to major contemporary real world problems--housing, medical care, discrimination, the economic development of nations--is the theme of this new book that tackles these and other issues head on in plain language, as distinguished from the usual jargon of economists. It examines economic policies not simply in terms of their immediate effects but also in terms of their later repercussions, which are often very different and longer lasting. The interplay of politics with economics is another theme of Applied Economics, whose examples are drawn from experiences around the world, showing how similar incentives and constraints tend to produce similar outcomes among very disparate peoples and cultures.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/31/9780465081431.jpg", "title_long": "Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One", "edition": "2nd prt.", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2003-11-13", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Development & Growth', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Thomas Sowell'], 'title": "Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One", "isbn13": "9780465081431", "msrp": 30, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"Page Fidelity": "0786722703", "eBook": "0786722703"}, "isbn": "0465081436", "isbn10": "0465081436", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780786722709", "binding": "print"}]}}
