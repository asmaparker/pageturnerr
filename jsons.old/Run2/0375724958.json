{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "Eric Hansen was the first westerner ever to walk across the island of Borneo. Completely cut off from the outside world for seven months, he traveled nearly 1,500 miles with small bands of nomadic hunters known as Penan. Beneath the rain forest canopy, they trekked through a hauntingly beautiful jungle where snakes and frogs fly, pigs climb trees, giant carnivorous plants eat mice, and mushrooms glow at night.<br/><br/>At once a modern classic of travel literature and a gripping adventure story, Stranger in the Forest provides a rare and intimate look at the vanishing way of life of one of the last surviving groups of rain forest dwellers. Hansen"s absorbing, and often chilling, account of his exploits is tempered with the humor and humanity that prompted the Penan to take him into their world and to share their secrets.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/54/9780375724954.jpg", "title_long": "Stranger in the Forest: On Foot Across Borneo", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.13 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.13}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.62}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.59}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.97}}, "pages": 286, "date_published": "2000-11-14", "subjects": ["Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Travel', 'Asia', 'Cambodia', 'Indonesia', 'Vietnam', 'Southeast', 'Specialty Travel', 'Adventure', 'Travel Writing'], 'authors": ["Eric Hansen'], 'title": "Stranger in the Forest: On Foot Across Borneo", "isbn13": "9780375724954", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375724958", "isbn10": "0375724958"}}
