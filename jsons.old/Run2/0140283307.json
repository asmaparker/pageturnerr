{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "A brilliant satire of mass culture and the numbing effects of technology, White Noise tells the story of Jack Gladney, a teacher of Hitler studies at a liberal arts college in Middle America. Jack and his fourth wife, Babette, bound by their love, fear of death, and four ultramodern offspring, navigate the rocky passages of family life to the background babble of brand-name consumerism. Then a lethal black chemical cloud, unleashed by an industrial accident, floats over there lives, an "airborne toxic event" that is a more urgent and visible version of the white noise engulfing the Gladneys—the radio transmissions, sirens, microwaves, and TV murmurings that constitute the music of American magic and dread.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/33/03/9780140283303.jpg", "title_long": "White Noise (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.54 Inches, Weight: 2.20462262 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.54}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.88}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.20462262}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.3}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "1999-06-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Don DeLillo'], 'title": "White Noise (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)", "isbn13": "9780140283303", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1440674477", "ePub": "1440674477"}, "isbn": "0140283307", "isbn10": "0140283307", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781440674471", "binding": "print"}]}}
