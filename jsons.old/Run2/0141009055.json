{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin", "synopsis": "Julie Otsuka\"s commanding and passionate debut novel explores unfamiliar history - that of Japanese Americans in World War II. With crystalline intensity and precision, Otsuka uses a single family to evoke the deracination of a generation who find themselves interned in their own country. With each chapter flawlessly executed from a different point of view - the mother; the daughter; the son; the family\"s return to their home; and the bitter release of their father - she has created a novel of unrelenting economy and suppressed emotion. "When The Emperor Was Divine' is a haunting evocation of a family in wartime and an unmistakably resonant lesson for our times. It heralds the arrival of a singularly gifted new novelist.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/90/56/9780141009056.jpg", "title_long": "When the Emperor Was Divine", "edition": "53179th", "dimensions": "Height: 7.83463 inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.33951188348 Pounds, Width: 0.47244 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.07873}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.47244}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.33951188348}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.83463}}, "pages": 160, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical'], 'authors": ["Julie Otsuka'], 'title": "When the Emperor Was Divine", "isbn13": "9780141009056", "msrp": 14.45, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0141009055", "isbn10": "0141009055"}}
