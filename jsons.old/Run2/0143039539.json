{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "The second revision in sixty years, this sublime collection ranges over the verse, stories, essays, and journalism of one of the twentieth century\"s most quotable authors.<br/><br/>In this new twenty-first-century edition, devoted admirers will be sure to find their favorite verse and stories. But a variety of fresh material has also been added to create a fuller, more authentic picture of her life\"s work. At the heart of her serious work lie her political writings dealing with race, labor, and international politics. "A Dorothy Parker Sampler' blends the sublime and the silly with the terrifying, a sort of tasting menu of verse, stories, essays, political journalism, a speech on writing, plus a catchy off-the-cuff rhyme she never thought to write down.<br/><br/>The introduction of two new sections is intended to provide the richest possible sense of Parker herself. 'Self-Portrait' reprints an interview she did in 1956 with The Paris Review, part of a famed ongoing series of conversations ('Writers at Work') conducted with the best of twentieth-century writers.<br/><br/>'Letters: 1905-1962,' which might be subtitled 'Mrs. Parker Completely Uncensored,' presents correspondence written over the period of a half century, beginning in 1905 when twelve-year-old Dottie wrote her father during a summer vacation on Long Island, and concluding with a 1962 missive from Hollywood describing her fondness for Marilyn Monroe.<br/><br/>Features an introduction by Marion Meade and cover illustrations by renowned graphic artist Seth, creator of the comic series Palooka-ville<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
