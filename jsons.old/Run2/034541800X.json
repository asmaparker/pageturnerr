A divorced, broke graduate student of Old Norse in 1970s New York, Trumper is a wayward knight-errant in the battle of the sexes and the pursuit of happiness: His ex-wife has moved in with his childhood best friend, his life is the subject of a tell-all movie, and his chronic urinary tract infection requires surgery.<br/><br/>Trumper is determined to change. There\"s only one problem: it seems the harder he tries to alter his adolescent ways, the more he is drawn to repeating the mistakes of the past. . . .<br/><br/>Written when Irving was twenty-nine, Trumper\'s tale of woe is told with all the wit and humor that would become Irving\'s trademark.<br/><br/>“Three or four times as funny as most novels.”—The New Yorker<br/><br/>Praise for The Water-Method Man<br/><br/>“Friendship, marriage, and family are his primary themes, but at that blundering level of life where mishap and folly—something close to joyful malice—perpetually intrude and distrupt, often fatally. Life, in [John] Irving\'s fiction, is always under siege. Harm and disarray are daily fare, as if the course of love could not run true. . . . Irving\'s multiple manner . . . his will to come at the world from different directions, is one of the outstandint traits of The World According to Garp, but this remarkable flair for . . . stories inside stories . . . isalready handled with mastery . . . and with a freedom almost wanton in The Water-Method Man [which is Garp\'s predecessor by six years].”—Terrence Des Pres<br/><br/>“Brutal reality and hallucination, comedy and pathos. A rich, unified tapestry.”—Time', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/05/9780345418005.jpg", "title_long": "The Water-Method Man (Ballantine Reader"s Circle)", 'edition": "~", "dimensions": "Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.65}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.58}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.3}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "1997-06-23", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Humorous', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John Irving'], 'title": "The Water-Method Man (Ballantine Reader"s Circle)", 'isbn13": "9780345418005", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1984800078", "ePub": "1984800078"}, "isbn": "034541800X", "isbn10": "034541800X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781984800077", "binding": "print"}]}}
