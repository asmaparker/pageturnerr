Equipped with mechanical “auto-mail” limbs, Edward becomes a state alchemist, seeking the one thing that can restore his and his brother’s bodies...the legendary Philosopher’s Stone.<br/><br/>Ed and Al come face to face with the "father" of the homunculi, who just so happens to be a dead ringer for their own father, Van Hohenheim--a resemblance too uncanny for coincidence. And later, when the allure of immortality proves to be too much for Prince Lin of Xin, he lets Greed take over...literally!", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/99/9781421513799.jpg", "title_long": "Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 14", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.44 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2007-08-21", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Media Tie-In', 'Shonen', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Hiromu Arakawa'], 'title": "Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 14", "isbn13": "9781421513799", "msrp": 9.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "142151379X", "isbn10": "142151379X"}}
