Nealy said.<br/>Hatch nodded, his gaze never leaving the colt. 'I have to say, Nealy, he\'s the finest piece of horseflesh I\'ve ever seen.' Shufly whinnied and would have broken away if the grooms hadn\'t kept a tight hold. 'Careful, Nealy,' Hatch warned. 'Something\'s got him spooked.' Nealy reached for Shufly\'s halter, brought his head down to hers and whispered in his ear. He immediately calmed, nuzzling his massive head against her arm. Awed at what he had just seen, Hatch walked over to the now calm Shufly and rubbed his muzzle.<br/>'Just out of curiosity, what did you whisper in his ear?'<br/>Nealy tilted her head to the side. 'I simply told him if he didn\'t behave himself, I wouldn\'t take him out to the track. I told him he had to behave like a gentleman.'<br/>Hatch grimaced. 'And you\'re telling me he understood what you said?'<br/>Nealy laughed. 'He calmed down, didn\'t he?' Hatch\'s eyes narrowed with disbelief. Was she putting him on? She certainly looked serious. Something in him clicked. Suddenly he had the overwhelming desire to know everything there was to know about Nealy Clay. He smiled. Nealy smiled back.<br/>She\'s in her element, Hatch thought. This is her life, her love. He was beginning to understand why Hunt had been so in love with her and why her children were so in awe of her. She was special, from the top of her head to the tip of her toes. It was going to take a team of wild horses to keep him away from her.<br/><br/>'Prose so natural that it seems you are witnessing a story rather than reading about it.' --Los Angeles Sunday Times on Kentucky Rich', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/80/9780821773680.jpg", "title_long": "Kentucky Heat", "dimensions": "Height: 6.8 Inches, Length: 4.4 Inches, Weight: 0.40124131684 Pounds, Width: 1.03 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.03}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.40124131684}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.8}}, "pages": 383, "date_published": "2002-09-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Women's Fiction', 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense'], 'authors": ["Fern Michaels'], 'title": "Kentucky Heat", "isbn13": "9780821773680", "msrp": 7.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0821773682", "isbn10": "0821773682"}}
