{"book": {"publisher": "Focus on the Family", "synopsis": "Ever wonder why your kids, parents, and even coworkers think and feel so differently than you do on core issues? Rick and Kathy Hicks contend and demonstrate that many of our core values are shaped largely by what was going on in our culture and world when we were about ten years old. By recognizing the factors that give rise to our own values and those of other generations, we can achieve greater mutual understanding and reconciliation with our children, peers, and coworkers, rather than finding ourselves in conflict. An effective tool for bridging the generation gap.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/79/9781561796779.jpg", "title_long": "Boomers, X-ers, and Other Strangers: Understanding/Generational Differences/Divide Us", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.64 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.64}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "1999-10-01", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Dating & Relationships', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology'], 'authors": ["Rick Hicks', 'Kathy Hicks'], 'title": "Boomers, X-ers, and Other Strangers: Understanding/Generational Differences/Divide Us", "isbn13": "9781561796779", "msrp": 14.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1561796778", "isbn10": "1561796778"}}
