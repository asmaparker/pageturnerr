Now, this beloved and iconic book returns in a beautiful 10th anniversary edition, complete with an updated introduction from the author, to launch a whole new generation of fans.<br/><br/>In her early thirties, Elizabeth Gilbert had everything a modern American woman was supposed to want—husband, country home, successful career—but instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed by panic and confusion. This wise and rapturous book is the story of how she left behind all these outward marks of success, and set out to explore three different aspects of her nature, against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/12/9780143038412.jpg", "title_long": "Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman"s Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia", "edition": 1, "dimensions": "Height: 8.42 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.86 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.86}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.42}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "2007-01-30", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Travel', 'Asia', 'Indonesia', 'Travel Writing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Elizabeth Gilbert'], 'title": "Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman"s Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia", 'isbn13": "9780143038412", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101010916", "ePub": "1101010916"}, "isbn": "0143038419", "isbn10": "0143038419", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101010914", "binding": "print"}]}}
