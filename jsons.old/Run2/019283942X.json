{"book": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "synopsis": "Horace (65-8 B.C.) is one of the most important and brilliant poets of the Augustan Age of Latin literature whose influence on European literature is unparalleled. Steeped in allusion to contemporary affairs, Horace\"s verse is best read in terms of his changing relationship to the public<br/>sphere. While the Odes are subtle and allusive, the Epodes are robust and coarse in their celebrations of sex and tirades against political leaders. This edition also includes the Secular Hymn and Suetonius\"s "Life of Horace.'', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/28/9780192839428.jpg", "title_long": "The Complete Odes and Epodes (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2000-05-16", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Movements & Periods', 'Genres & Styles', 'Poetry', 'Ancient, Classical & Medieval', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ['Horace'], 'title": "The Complete Odes and Epodes (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'isbn13": "9780192839428", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "019283942X", "isbn10": "019283942X"}}
