{"book": {"publisher": "Pantheon", "synopsis": "One of the great but often unmentioned causes of both happiness and misery is the quality of our environment: the kinds of walls, chairs, buildings and streets that surround us.<br/><br/>And yet a concern for architecture and design is too often described as frivolous, even self-indulgent. The Architecture of Happiness starts from the idea that where we are heavily influences who we can be, and it argues that it is architecture’s task to stand as an eloquent reminder of our full potential.<br/><br/>Whereas many architects are wary of openly discussing the word beauty, this book has at its center the large and naïve question: What is a beautiful building? It is a tour through the philosophy and psychology of architecture that aims to change the way we think about our homes, our streets and ourselves.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/34/9780375424434.jpg", "title_long": "The Architecture of Happiness", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.34 Inches, Length: 6.37 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.37}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.87}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.34}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "2006-10-03", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Architecture', 'Criticism', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Aesthetics'], 'authors": ["Alain De Botton'], 'title": "The Architecture of Happiness", "isbn13": "9780375424434", "msrp": 26.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0375424431", "isbn10": "0375424431"}}
