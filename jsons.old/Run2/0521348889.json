{"book": {"publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "synopsis": "This book is a translation of a classic work of modern social and political thought. Elements of the Philosophy of Right, Hegel"s last major published work, is an attempt to systematize ethical theory, natural right, the philosophy of law, political theory, and the sociology of the modern state into the framework of Hegel"s philosophy of history. Hegel"s work has been interpreted in radically different ways, influencing many political movements from far right to far left, and is widely perceived as central to the communitarian tradition in modern ethical, social, and political thought. This edition includes extensive editorial material informing the reader of the historical background of Hegel's text, and explaining his allusions to Roman law and other sources, making use of lecture materials which have only recently become available. The new translation is literal, readable, and consistent, and will be informative and scholarly enough to serve the needs of students and specialists alike.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/81/9780521348881.jpg", "title_long": "Hegel: Elements of the Philosophy of Right (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)", "edition": "Revised ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.72401488884 Pounds, Width: 1.43 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.43}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.72401488884}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 569, "date_published": "1991-10-25", "subjects": ["Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'History & Surveys', 'Political', 'Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Georg Wilhelm Fredrich Hegel'], 'title": "Hegel: Elements of the Philosophy of Right (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)", "isbn13": "9780521348881", "msrp": 23.3, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1107263611"}, "isbn": "0521348889", "isbn10": "0521348889", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781107263611", "binding": "print"}, {"isbn": "9781107266186", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
