{"book": {"publisher": "Del Rey", "synopsis": "CAN PURE DETERMINATION DEFEAT A MASTER MAGICIAN?<br/>Sakura is awake, but she remembers almost nothing–certainly not Syaoran, who has sacrificed everything to help her. Accompanied by the happy-go-lucky Fai, the intense Kurogane, and the strikingly odd creature Mokona Modoki, Sakura and Syaoran make their way into a new universe where a traveling magician has suddenly become frighteningly powerful and is terrorizing an entire town. Only a few independent-minded stragglers remain to battle for control of their own lives. Fai, the lone magician in the group, traded his magical powers to the dimension witch, xxxHOLiC’s Yûko, before the journey started. Without a weapon with which to fight, can the extraordinary group of friends defeat a master magician who can control the Earth’s elements?", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/33/9780345471833.jpg", "title_long": "Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 3", "edition": "First Edition November 2004", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2004-10-26", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors": ["Clamp'], 'title": "Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 3", "isbn13": "9780345471833", "msrp": 10.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345471830", "isbn10": "0345471830"}}
