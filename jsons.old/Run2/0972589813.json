{"book": {"publisher": "Vince Emery Productions", "synopsis": "Dashiell Hammett, the creator of Sam Spade, The Maltese Falcon, and The Thin Man, was one of the 20th century’s most influential and entertaining authors. Even so, many of Hammett’s stories—including some of his best—have been out of the reach of anyone but a handful of scholars and collectors, until now. This essential compendium rescues 21 long-lost Hammett stories, all either never collected in an anthology or unavailable for decades. These stories appear nowhere else, and represent a variety of styles from the famous mysterysmith: his first detective fiction, humorous satires, adventure yarns, a sensitive autobiographical piece, and a Thin Man story told with photos. In addition, all stories have been restored to their original versions, replacing often wholesale cuttings with the original text for the first time. To round out this celebration of Hammett, three-time Edgar Award–winner Joe Gores has written an introduction describing how Hammett influenced literature, movies, television, and Gores’ own life.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/19/9780972589819.jpg", "title_long": "Lost Stories (The Ace Performer Collection series)", "edition": "21", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.79897205792 Pounds, Width: 1.23 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.23}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.79897205792}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2005-09-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Hard-Boiled'], 'authors": ["Dashiell Hammett'], 'title": "Lost Stories (The Ace Performer Collection series)", "isbn13": "9780972589819", "msrp": 24.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0972589813", "isbn10": "0972589813"}}
