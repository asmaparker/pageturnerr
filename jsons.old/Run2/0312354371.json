News anchor Giuliana DePandi knows that if you want a little piece of his heart, you\"re going to have to learn to get into his head--and she shares her knowledge as an on-the-town dater in L.A. into this funny but oh-so-practical and effective volume.<br/>DePandi knows what it\'s like 'out there', and has done extensive field work to learn what turns guys off...and on. Here\'s a pop quiz:<br/>Should you<br/>...mention your mom on a first date?<br/>...cook a guy breakfast after your first sleepover at his place?<br/>...pick at your food when he takes you to dinner?<br/>...tell him how many lovers you\'ve had before he came along?<br/>...leave him long voicemails if you can\'t reach him on the phone?<br/>The resounding answer to all the questions above, according to DePandi, is: NO! You should, in fact, be busy and breezy, offer to pay for dinner, leave short voicemails (and none at all if you don\'t have anything concrete to say), stay well-dressed and -groomed, and make your guy feel like he\'s the first to introduce you to anything kinky in bed.<br/>Think Like a Guy is a hard-headed practical book for women who acknowledge that men and women simply think differently.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/74/9780312354374.jpg", "title_long": "Think Like a Guy", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.1 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.39462744898 Pounds, Width: 0.48 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.48}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39462744898}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.1}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2006-06-27", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Dating', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Love & Romance', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Parenting & Relationships'], 'authors": ["Giuliana Depandi'], 'title": "Think Like a Guy", "isbn13": "9780312354374", "msrp": 9.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312354371", "isbn10": "0312354371", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781429903530", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
