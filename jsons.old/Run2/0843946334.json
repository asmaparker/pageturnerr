{"book": {"publisher": "Leisure Books", "synopsis": "There"s something in the attic of Fortyfoot House. Something that rustles. Something that scampers and scratches. Something with fur, far more terrifying than a rat. â€” Recently divorced, David Williams takes a job restoring Fortyfoot House, a dilapidated 19th-century orphanage, hoping to find peace of mind and get to know his young son, Danny. But then he hears the scratching noises in the attic. And he sees long-dead people walking across the lawn.<br/><br/>Does Fortyfoot House exist in today, yesterday, or tomorrow- or all three at once? Only one thing is certain- it is a house with a dark unthinkable secret that threatens to send David"s world hurling into a living nightmare. A nightmare that only David himself can prevent- if he can escape the thing in the attic.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/38/9780843946338.jpg", "title_long": "Prey", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "1999", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror'], 'authors": ["Graham Masterton'], 'title": "Prey", "isbn13": "9780843946338", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0843946334", "isbn10": "0843946334"}}
