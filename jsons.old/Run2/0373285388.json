{"book": {"publisher": "Silhouette", "synopsis": "Escaping the rat race and the lure of gold-digging women, wealthy businessman Vance Banning moves to a small, rural retreat, telling the townsfolk that he"s an out-of-work carpenter. All he wants is peace, quiet and to keep away from women. So the last thing he needs is a charitable neighbor—especially a beautiful, gracious and persistent neighbor of the female persuasion—but there"s something about Shane Abbott he just can"t ignore.<br/>Vance is certain his cover story will stop his lovely neighbor from getting too friendly, but Shane is determined to break down his resistance. Vance has been burned once, so only a fool would fall for the same innocent act twice. And he's no fool. But he has no idea how relentless Shane Abbott can be when it comes to giving a helping hand—or a loving heart.<br/>He needed to simplify his life and mend his broken heart. She was searching for a place to finally fit in and a man who could love her for who she was. Together they discover that all they really needed was each other, and that love is the greatest Christmas gift of all.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/89/9780373285389.jpg", "title_long": "First Impressions (Language of Love)", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.499985 Inches, Length: 5.499989 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 1.08999782 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.499989}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.08999782}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.499985}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2006-10-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Nora Roberts'], 'title": "First Impressions (Language of Love)", "isbn13": "9780373285389", "msrp": 17.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0373285388", "isbn10": "0373285388"}}
