Schlep.<br/><br/>Schlep, schlep, schlep.<br/><br/>In text that captures the unque rhythms of the original Dick and Jane readers, and in 35 all-new illustrations, a story unfolds in which Dick and Jane -- hero and heroine of the classic books for children that generations of Americans have used when learning to read -- manage to express shades of feeling and nuances of meaning that ordinary English just can"t deliver. How? By speaking Yiddish, employing terms that convey an attitude -- part plucky self-assertion, part ironic fatalism. When Dick schmoozes, when Jane kvetches, when their children fress noodles at a Chinese restaurant, the clash of cultures produces genuine hilarity.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/22/9780316159722.jpg", "title_long": "Yiddish with Dick and Jane", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.2 Inches, Length: 5.3 Inches, Weight: 0.44533376924 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.3}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44533376924}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.2}}, "pages": 112, "date_published": "2004-09-13", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Parodies', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire'], 'authors": ["Ellis Weiner', 'Barbara Davilman'], 'title": "Yiddish with Dick and Jane", "isbn13": "9780316159722", "msrp": 13.57, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0316159727", "isbn10": "0316159727"}}
