{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "The American poet John Shade is dead; murdered. His last poem, Pale Fire, is put into a book, together with a preface, a lengthy commentary and notes by Shade"s editor, Charles Kinbote. Known on campus as the "Great Beaver", Kinbote is haughty, inquisitive, intolerant, but is he also mad, bad - and even dangerous? As his wildly eccentric annotations slide into the personal and the fantastical, Kinbote reveals perhaps more than he should. Nabokov's darkly witty, richly inventive masterwork is a suspenseful whodunit, a story of one-upmanship and dubious penmanship, and a glorious literary conundrum.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/52/62/9780141185262.jpg", "title_long": "Pale Fire by Nabokov, Vladimir ( Author ) ON Aug-31-2000, Paperback", "dimensions": "Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.5118 Inches, Weight: 0.53351867404 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5118}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7874}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.53351867404}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.79526}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2010", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors": ["Vladimir Nabokov'], 'title": "Pale Fire by Nabokov, Vladimir ( Author ) ON Aug-31-2000, Paperback", "isbn13": "9780141185262", "msrp": 19.75, 'binding": "Unknown Binding", "isbn": "0141185260", "isbn10": "0141185260"}}
