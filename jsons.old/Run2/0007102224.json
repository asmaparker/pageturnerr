Their foe cast a lifelong curse of enmity between them that has so far woven three bitter conflicts and uncounted deadly intrigues.<br/>It is a time of political upheavel, fanaticism and rampaging armies. Distrust of sorcery has set off a purge of the talented mageborn – none reviled more than Arithon, Master of Shadow. Through clever manipulation of events at the hands of his half-brother Lysaer, Lord of Light, Arithon’s very name has become anathema. Now the volatile hatreds that spearheaded the campaign against Shadow have overtaken all reason.<br/>Those that still stand in Arithon’s desperate defence are downtrodden, in retreat and close to annihilation. The stage is set for the ultimate betrayal.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/22/28/9780007102228.jpg", "title_long": "Alliance of light, book two: Grand conspiracy", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.5 Inches, Weight: 0.771617917 Pounds, Width: 1.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.771617917}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 656, "date_published": "2000", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'War', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Military'], 'authors": ["Janny WURTS'], 'title": "Alliance of light, book two: Grand conspiracy", "isbn13": "9780007102228", "msrp": 5.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0007102224", "isbn10": "0007102224"}}
