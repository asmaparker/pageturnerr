{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial", "synopsis": "Ann Patchett and the late Lucy Grealy met in college in 1981, and, after enrolling in the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, began a friendship that would be as defining to both of their lives as their work. In Grealy’s critically acclaimed memoir, Autobiography of a Face, she wrote about losing part of her jaw to childhood cancer, years of chemotherapy and radiation, and endless reconstructive surgeries. In Truth & Beauty, the story isn’t Lucy’s life or Ann’s life, but the parts of their lives they shared. This is a portrait of unwavering commitment that spans twenty years, from the long winters of the Midwest, to surgical wards, to book parties in New York. Through love, fame, drugs, and despair, this is what it means to be part of two lives that are intertwined . . . and what happens when one is left behind.<br/>This is a tender, brutal book about loving the person we cannot save. It is about loyalty, and being lifted up by the sheer effervescence of someone who knew how to live life to the fullest.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/21/50/9780060572150.jpg", "title_long": "Truth & Beauty: A Friendship", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.47 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.59}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.47}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 257, "date_published": "2023-05-09", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Friendship', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Science & Math', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Nature Writing & Essays', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Ann Patchett'], 'title": "Truth & Beauty: A Friendship", "isbn13": "9780060572150", "msrp": 10.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0061754811", "ePub": "0061754811"}, "isbn": "0060572159", "isbn10": "0060572159", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061754814", "binding": "print"}]}}
