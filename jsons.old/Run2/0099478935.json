{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage Canada", "synopsis": "On the tenth anniversary of the date that UN peacekeepers landed in Rwanda, Random House Canada is proud to publish the unforgettable first-hand account of the genocide by the man who led the UN mission. Digging deep into shattering memories, General Dallaire has written a powerful story of betrayal, naivete, racism and international politics. His message is simple and undeniable: "Never again.' When Lt-Gen. Romeo Dallaire received the call to serve as force commander of the UN intervention in Rwanda in 1993, he thought he was heading off on a modest and straightforward peacekeeping mission. Thirteen months later he flew home from Africa, broken, disillusioned and suicidal, having witnessed the slaughter of 800,
        000 Rwandans in only a hundred days. In "Shake Hands with the Devil", he takes the reader with him on a return voyage into the hell of Rwanda, vividly recreating the events the international community turned its back on. This book is an unsparing eyewitness account of the failure by humanity to stop the genocide, despite timely warnings. Woven through the story of this disastrous mission is Dallaire\'s own journey from confident Cold Warrior, to devastated UN commander, to retired general engaged in a painful struggle to find a measure of peace, reconciliation and hope. This book is General Dallaire\'s personal account of his conversion from a man certain of his worth and secure in his assumptions to a man conscious of his own weaknesses and failures and critical of the institutions he\'d relied on. It might not sit easily with standard ideas of military leadership, but understanding what happened to General Dallaire and his mission to Rwanda is crucial to understanding the moral minefields our peacekeepers are forced to negotiate when we ask them to step into the world\'s dirty wars.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/89/35/9780099478935.jpg", "title_long": "Shake Hands With the Devil : The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda", "edition": "First Paperback Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 inches, Weight: 0.8928721611 Pounds, Width: 1.37795 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.07873}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.37795}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8928721611}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.79526}}, "pages": 592, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'Africa', 'Central Africa', 'East Africa', 'World', 'Law', 'Constitutional Law', 'Human Rights', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics', 'Public Affairs & Policy'], 'authors": ["Romeo Dallaire'], 'title": "Shake Hands With the Devil : The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda", "isbn13": "9780099478935", "msrp": 10.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0099478935", "isbn10": "0099478935"}}
