From his coming of age in America, to his formative war experiences, to his life as an artist, this is Vonnegut doing what he does best: Being himself. Whimsically illustrated by the author, A Man Without a Country is intimate, tender, and brimming with the scope of Kurt Vonnegut’s passions.<br/><br/>Praise for A Man Without a Country<br/><br/>“[This] may be as close as Vonnegut ever comes to a memoir.”–Los Angeles Times<br/><br/>“Like [that of] his literary ancestor Mark Twain, [Kurt Vonnegut’s] crankiness is good-humored and sharp-witted. . . . [Reading A Man Without a Country is] like sitting down on the couch for a long chat with an old friend.”–The New York Times Book Review<br/><br/>“Filled with [Vonnegut’s] usual contradictory mix of joy and sorrow, hope and despair, humor and gravity.”–Chicago Tribune<br/><br/>“Fans will linger on every word . . . as once again [Vonnegut] captures the complexity of the human condition with stunning calligraphic simplicity.”–The Australian<br/><br/>“Thank God, Kurt Vonnegut has broken his promise that he will never write another book. In this wondrous assemblage of mini-memoirs, we discover his family’s legacy and his obstinate, unfashionable humanism.”–Studs Terkel", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/63/9780812977363.jpg", "title_long": "A Man Without a Country", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.29 Pounds, Width: 0.42 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.14}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.42}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.29}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.98}}, "pages": 160, "date_published": "2007-01-16", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political', 'Reference & Collections', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Letters', 'United States', 'Anthologies', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Kurt Vonnegut'], 'title": "A Man Without a Country", "isbn13": "9780812977363", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0525510133"}, "isbn": "081297736X", "isbn10": "081297736X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780525510130", "binding": "print"}]}}
