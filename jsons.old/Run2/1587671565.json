On this particular night a stranger steps out of the shadowy park to sit at the sidewalk tables and speak of love and murder.<br/><br/>In 'A Madness of Starlings,' a father, teaching his children about protection from the predators of life, takes in a fledgling bird. But when it\'s time for the bird to fly away, the forces of nature come undone and a secret wisdom and terror enter the mind of the one who understands the language of birds.<br/><br/>Finally, in 'The Dark Game,' a war hero and his men are captured and taken into a prison camp. There, tortures and torments await them, but the man named Gordon Raglan begins to use a childhood game of escape to help him discover a way to hunt the wolves surrounding him.<br/><br/>Wild Things: Four Tales is a unique and exclusive Cemetery Dance book, with no other editions planned anywhere in the world at this time!', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/62/9781587671562.jpg", "title_long": "Wild Things: Four Tales", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.52}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 100, "date_published": "2006-10-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror'], 'authors": ["Douglas Clegg'], 'title": "Wild Things: Four Tales", "isbn13": "9781587671562", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1587671565", "isbn10": "1587671565"}}
