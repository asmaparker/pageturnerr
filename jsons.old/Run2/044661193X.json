{"book": {"publisher": "Grand Central Publishing", "synopsis": "Once a hotshot investigative reporter, Jack Tagger now bangs out obituaries for a South Florida daily, "plotting to resurrect my career by yoking my byline to some famous stiff." Jimmy Stoma, the infamous front man of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, dead in a fishy-smelling scuba "accident' may be just the stiff Jack needs-if only he can figure out what happened. Standing in the way are [among others] an editor who wants Jack to 'break her cherry,' Stoma\'s ambitious pop-singer widow, and the soulless, profit-hungry newspaper owner Jack once publicly humiliated. As clues from Stoma\'s music give Jack Tagger the chance to trade obits for a story that could hit the front page, murder gives his career a new lease on life.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/30/9780446611930.jpg", "title_long": "Basket Case", "dimensions": "Height: 6.875 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.875}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2003-01-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Carl Hiaasen'], 'title": "Basket Case", "isbn13": "9780446611930", "msrp": 7.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "044661193X", "isbn10": "044661193X"}}
