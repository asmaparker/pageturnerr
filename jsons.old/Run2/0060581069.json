{"book": {"publisher": "Avon", "synopsis": "I Dreamed I Married Perry Mason is the debut novel in a hip, sexy, smart and, yes, cozy mystery series with a great hook. Think Sex and the City collides with Murder, She Wrote.<br/>All that writer Cece Caruso really wants to do is complete her biography of mystery legend Erle Stanley Gardner, find a vintage 1970s Ossie Clark gown to add to her collection, and fix the doorknob on her picturesque West Hollywood bungalow. Then a chance visit with a prison inmate who knew Gardner lands her right in the middle of a 40–year–old murder and another case where the blood is still warm. In fact, Cece finds the body. This brings her into irresistible contact with her inner personal sleuth and shows how crime and greed can reverberate through several generations of a single family.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/10/60/9780060581060.jpg", "title_long": "I Dreamed I Married Perry Mason (CeCe Caruso Mysteries)", "edition": "~", "dimensions": "Height: 0.83 Inches, Length: 6.82 Inches, Weight: 0.32 Pounds, Width: 4.18 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.82}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.18}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.32}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.83}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Amateur Sleuths'], 'authors": ["Susan Kandel'], 'title": "I Dreamed I Married Perry Mason (CeCe Caruso Mysteries)", "isbn13": "9780060581060", "msrp": 6.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0061972932"}, "isbn": "0060581069", "isbn10": "0060581069", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061972935", "binding": "print"}]}}
