{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "A rich collection of poems from not only “one of the great short story writers of our time” (The Philadelphia Inquirer), but one of America’s most large-hearted and affecting poets.<br/><br/>Like Raymond Carver’s stories, the more than 300 poems in All of Us are marked by a keen attention to the physical world; an uncanny ability to compress vast feeling into discreet moments; a voice of conversational intimacy, and an unstinting sympathy.<br/><br/>This complete edition brings together all the poems of Carver’s five previous books, from Fires to the posthumously published No Heroics, Please. It also contains bibliographical and textual notes on individual poems; a chronology of Carver’s life and work; and a moving introduction by Carver’s widow, the poet Tess Gallagher.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/05/9780375703805.jpg", "title_long": "All of Us: The Collected Poems", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.86 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.86}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.98}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "1996-04-04", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Genres & Styles', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Themes & Styles', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Raymond Carver'], 'title": "All of Us: The Collected Poems", "isbn13": "9780375703805", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101970537"}, "isbn": "0375703802", "isbn10": "0375703802", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101970539", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
