{"book": {"publisher": "Gardners Books", "synopsis": "Anyone who involves himself with Roberta Wickham is asking for trouble, so naturally Bertie Wooster finds himself in just that situation when he goes to stay with his Aunt Dahlia at Brinkley Court. So much is obvious. Why celebrated loony-doctor Sir Roderick Glossop should be there too, masquerading as a butler, is less clear. As for Bertie"s former headmaster, the ghastly Aubrey Upjohn, the dreadful novelist, Mrs Homer Cream and her eccentric son Wilbert, their presence is entirely perplexing. Without Jeeves to help him solve these mysteries, Bertie nearly comes unstuck. It is only when that peerless manservant returns from his holiday that the resulting tangle of problems is sorted out to everyone"s satisfaction - except Bertie"s.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/62/9781841591162.jpg", "title_long": "Jeeves In The Offing (Everyman"s Library P G WODEHOUSE)", 'dimensions": "Height: 7.4803 Inches, Length: 5.31495 Inches, Width: 0.90551 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31495}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.90551}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.4803}}, "pages": 200, "date_published": "2002", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ['P.G.
