The first is autobiographical, describing his wartime boyhood. The second tale, denser, more disturbing, more horrifying, is the allegorical story of W, a mythical island off Tierra del Fuego governed by the thrall of the Olympic “ideal,” where losers are tortured and winners held in temporary idolatry. As the reader soon discovers, W is a place where “it is more important to be lucky than to be deserving,” and “you have to fight to live...no recourse, no mercy, no salvation, not even any hope that time will sort things out.”<br/><br/>Perec’s memory of the Holocaust and vision about its meaning has resulted in an astonishing achievement that stands with the best of his work.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/88/9781567921588.jpg", "title_long": "w-or-the-memory-of-childhood", "dimensions": "Height: 8.86 Inches, Length: 5.22 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.22}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.45}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.50044933474}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.86}}, "pages": 164, "date_published": "2002", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Metaphysical & Visionary', 'World Literature', 'Jewish', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopian'], 'authors": ["georges-perec'], 'title": "w-or-the-memory-of-childhood", "isbn13": "9781567921588", "msrp": 17.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1567921582", "isbn10": "1567921582"}}
