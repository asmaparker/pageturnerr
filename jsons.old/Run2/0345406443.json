Now an evil rich man was out to kidnap the minidrag for his personal zoo, and Flinx and Pip were on the run again—this time into uncharted space, on a random course they hoped would foil their pursuers.<br/><br/>They found more than they bargained for when they landed on Midworld, a verdant planet covered by an immense jungle, hosting an incredible variety of plant and animal life—all of it unknown and all of it deadly. And now they were in real trouble. Their hiding place was in danger of discovery, and their only hope lay with this bizarre and untamed planet . . . if it didn"t kill them first!", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/46/9780345406446.jpg", "title_long": "Mid-Flinx (Adventures of Pip & Flinx)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 6.85 Inches, Length: 4.13 Inches, Weight: 0.38 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.13}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.77}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.38}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.85}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "1996-09-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera'], 'authors": ["Alan Dean Foster'], 'title": "Mid-Flinx (Adventures of Pip & Flinx)", "isbn13": "9780345406446", "msrp": 7.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "034545457X", "ePub": "034545457X"}, "isbn": "0345406443", "isbn10": "0345406443", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780345454577", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
