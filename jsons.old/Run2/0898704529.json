No writer in history, claims Kreeft, is a more effective Christian apologist and evangelist to today"s uprooted, confused, secularized pagans (inside and outside the Church) than Pascal. He was a brilliant man--a great scientist who did major work in physics and mathematics, as well as an inventor--whom Kreeft thinks was three centuries ahead of his time.
