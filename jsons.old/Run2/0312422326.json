{"book": {"publisher": "Picador", "synopsis": "Paul Auster"s Hand to Mouth: A Chronicle of Early Failure is a fascinating and often funny memoir about his early years as a writer struggling to be published, and to make enough money to survive.<br/><br/>This is the story of a young man"s struggle to stay afloat. By turns poignant and comic, Paul Auster"s memoir is essentially an autobiographical essay about money--and what it means not to have it. From one odd job to the next, from one failed scheme to another, Auster investigates his own stubborn compulsion to make art and describes his ingenious, often far-fetched attempts to survive on next to nothing. From the streets of New York City and Paris to the rural roads of upstate New York, the author treats us to a series of remarkable adventures and unforgettable cast of characters while examining what it means to be a writer.<br/><br/>“Required, inspiring reading for Auster-holics and aspiring writers.” ―Kirkus Reviews', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/25/9780312422325.jpg", "title_long": "Hand to Mouth: A Chronicle of Early Failure", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.3751961 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.3751961}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "2003-08-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Paul Auster'], 'title": "Hand to Mouth: A Chronicle of Early Failure", "isbn13": "9780312422325", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312422326", "isbn10": "0312422326", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781466817647", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
