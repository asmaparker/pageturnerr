{"book": {"publisher": "Dark Horse", "synopsis": "When Wagner first serialized Grendel: Devil by the Deed as a backup in his critically acclaimed title Mage, its innovative storytelling techniques, philosophical undertones, and charismatic anti-hero ignited a devoted following. Introducing Hunter Rose as the brilliant, twisted assassin Grendel, it gave birth to what would become a centuries-spanning epic exploring the roots and consequences of violence. This influential tale has been collected only twice in the past twenty years, quickly selling out each time. Now, for the first time in hardcover, Dark Horse presents the book that brought one of the most popular alternative comics characters to life and marked the auspicious arrival of one of the greatest visionaries of modern comics!", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/65/9781593077365.jpg", "title_long": "Grendel: Devil By The Deed (Grendel (Graphic Novels))", "dimensions": "Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.72 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.72}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.75}}, "pages": 48, "date_published": "2007-04-10", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Horror', 'Superheroes', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors": ["Matt Wagner'], 'title": "Grendel: Devil By The Deed (Grendel (Graphic Novels))", "isbn13": "9781593077365", "msrp": 6.99, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "159307736X", "isbn10": "159307736X"}}
