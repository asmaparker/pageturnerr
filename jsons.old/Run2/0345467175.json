He was a fugitive from Tarnover, the high-powered government think tank that had educated him. First he had broken his identity code—then he escaped.<br/><br/>Now he had to find a way to restore sanity and personal freedom to the computerized masses and to save a world tottering on the brink of disaster. He didn’t care how he did it—but the government did. That’s when his Tarnover teachers got him back in their labs . . . and Nickie Haflinger was set up for a whole new education.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/71/71/9780345467171.jpg", "title_long": "The Shockwave Rider", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.76 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.76}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "1995-03-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Post-Apocalyptic', 'Cyberpunk', 'Genetic Engineering'], 'authors": ["John Brunner'], 'title": "The Shockwave Rider", "isbn13": "9780345467171", "msrp": 19, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345467175", "isbn10": "0345467175"}}
