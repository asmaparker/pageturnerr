Becky is just one of the many fascinating figures that populate &&LB&&RWilliam Makepeace Thackeray&&L/B&&R’s novel &&LI&&RVanity Fair&&L/I&&R, a wonderfully satirical panorama of upper-middle-class life and manners in London at the beginning of the nineteenth century. &&LP&&RScorned for her lack of money and breeding, Becky must use all her wit, charm and considerable sex appeal to escape her drab destiny as a governess. From London’s ballrooms to the battlefields of Waterloo, the bewitching Becky works her wiles on a gallery of memorable characters, including her lecherous employer, Sir Pitt, his rich sister, Miss Crawley, and Pitt’s dashing son, Rawdon, the first of Becky’s misguided sexual entanglements. &&L/P&&R&&LP&&RFilled with hilarious dialogue and superb characterizations, &&LI&&RVanity Fair&&L/I&&R is a richly entertaining comedy that asks the reader, “Which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?” &&L/P&&R&&LDIV&&R&&LB&&RFeatures more than 100 illustrations drawn by Thackeray himself for the initial publication.&&L/B&&R &&L/DIV&&R&&LDIV&&R &&L/DIV&&R&&LDIV&&R&&LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&&R&&LSTRONG&&RNicholas Dames&&L/B&&R&&L/B&&R is Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and is the author of &&LI&&RAmnesiac Selves: Nostalgia, Forgetting, and British Fiction, 1810–1870&&L/I&&R, and other commentary on nineteenth-century British and French fiction.&&L/P&&R&&L/DIV&&R&&L/DIV&&R', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/16/9781593080716.jpg", "title_long": "Vanity Fair (Barnes & Noble Classics)", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.1875 Inches, Weight: 1.32 Pounds, Width: 1.84 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.84}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.32}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 736, "date_published": "2003-11-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["William Makepeace Thackeray'], 'title": "Vanity Fair (Barnes & Noble Classics)", "isbn13": "9781593080716", "msrp": 8.95, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1593080719", "isbn10": "1593080719", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781411433403", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
