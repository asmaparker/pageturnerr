{"book": {"publisher": "Random House Publishing Group", "synopsis": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • When a pair of lowlife thieves cross the border into Tijuana, three tenacious cops cross the line.<br/><br/>Fin Finnegan is a San Diego police detective and wannabe actor who’s passing midlife crisis and heading straight for midlife meltdown. The last thing he wants when he’s gearing up for a TV audition is a routine truck theft case. The last thing he needs after three messy divorces is a sexy female investigator assigned to the case. Fin’s abysmal luck is holding out—he’s got not only the theft investigation but an uneasy alliance with two strong-willed women, each working a separate angle of his once-simple case.<br/><br/>Tough, sexy environmental cop Nell Salter is looking into a chemical spill that has set off a chain reaction of death in the barrios of Tijuana and across the border. She’s also looking for a relationship that doesn’t turn toxic. Young, fresh-faced navy detective Bobbie Ann Doggett is investigating the theft of two thousand pairs of navy flight-deck shoes—and swooning over the Olivier of the San Diego PD. Mix in a unpredictable speed-freak trucker and his sociopath boss, and the result is a toxic cocktail of drugs, corruption, sex, and murder.<br/><br/>Praise for Finnegan’s Week<br/><br/>“A frolic, a joy, a hoot, a riot of a book.”—The New York Times Book Review<br/><br/>“Raunchy and often hilarious . . .
