{"book": {"publisher": "Grove Press", "synopsis": "Here are two major works by the famed Polish novelist and dramatist Witold Gombrowicz. The first, Cosmos, a metaphysical thriller, revolves around an absurd investigation. It is set in provincial Poland and narrated by a seedy, pathetic, and witty student, who is charming and appalling by turns, and whose voice is dense with the richly palpable description that characterizes Gombrowicz"s writing. The second, Pornografia, explores the sinister effect the young can have on the old. To serve their own secret eroticism, two aging intellectuals encourage a young couple to commit murder. Although the adolescents are the weapons used to commit the crime, the four become conspirators before the deed is done.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/99/9780802151599.jpg", "title_long": "Cosmos and Pornografia: Two Novels", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.79}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 362, "date_published": "1994-03-23", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Erotica', 'Thrillers', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers'], 'authors": ["Witold Gombrowicz'], 'title": "Cosmos and Pornografia: Two Novels", "isbn13": "9780802151599", "msrp": 14.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0802151590", "isbn10": "0802151590"}}
