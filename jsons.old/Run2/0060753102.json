But what she lacks in appearance, she can perhaps make up for in courage.<br/>When her father comes home with a tale of an enchanted castle in the forest and the terrible promise he had to make to the Beast who lives there, Beauty knows she must travel to the castle, a prisoner of her own free will. Her father insists that he will not let her go, but she responds, “Cannot a Beast be tamed?”<br/>Newbery Medalist Robin McKinley’s beloved and acclaimed novel has been delighting readers for more than forty years.
