{"book": {"publisher": "Bantam", "synopsis": "In this wickedly funny novel, Robert Ludlum combines the explosive pacing of The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy with a bitingly witty send-up of everything from government bureaucrats and pandering military men to the mob, the law, and organized religion.<br/><br/>War hero and infamous ladies’ man, General MacKenzie Hawkins is a living legend. His life story had even been sold to Hollywood. But now he stands accused of defacing a historic monument in China’s Forbidden City. Under house arrest in Peking, with a case against him pending in Washington, it looks like the end of Mac’s illustrious career.<br/><br/>But he has a plan of his own—and it includes kidnapping the Pope. What’s the ransom? Just one American dollar—for every Catholic in the world. Add to the mix a slew of shady “investors,” Hawkins’s four persuasive, well-endowed ex-wives, and a young lawyer and fellow soldier who wants nothing more than to return to private life—and you’ve got one relentlessly irreverent page-turner.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/96/9780553271096.jpg", "title_long": "The Road to Gandolfo", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 6.9 Inches, Length: 4.15 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.85}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.9}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "1992", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Crime'], 'authors": ["Robert Ludlum'], 'title": "The Road to Gandolfo", "isbn13": "9780553271096", "msrp": 7.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307813924", "ePub": "0307813924"}, "isbn": "0553271091", "isbn10": "0553271091", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307813923", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
