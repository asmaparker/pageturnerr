{"book": {"publisher": "Everyman"s Library", "synopsis": "A stunning collector’s hardcover edition of Michel de Montaigne, the father of the essay. Translated by Donald M. Frame with an Introduction by Stuart Hampshire.<br/><br/>Humanist, skeptic, acute observer of himself and others, Michel de Montaigne (1533—92) was the first to use the term “essay” to refer to the form he pioneered, and he has remained one of its most famous practitioners. He reflected on the great themes of existence in his wise and engaging writings, his subjects ranging from proper conversation and good reading, to the raising of children and the endurance of pain, from solitude, destiny, time, and custom, to truth, consciousness, and death. Having stood the test of time, his essays continue to influence writers nearly five hundred years later.<br/><br/>Also included in this complete edition of his works are Montaigne’s letters and his travel journal, fascinating records of the experiences and contemplations that would shape and infuse his essays. Montaigne speaks to us always in a personal voice in which his virtues of tolerance, moderation, and understanding are dazzlingly manifest.<br/><br/>Donald M. Frame’s masterful translation is widely acknowledged to be the classic English version.<br/><br/>Everyman"s Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket. Everyman’s Library Classics include an introduction, a select bibliography, and a chronology of the author"s life and times.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/16/9781400040216.jpg", "title_long": "The Complete Works (Everyman"s Library)", 'edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.26 Inches, Length: 5.37 Inches, Weight: 2.71 Pounds, Width: 2.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.37}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.71}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.26}}, "pages": 1392, "date_published": "2003-04-29", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Diaries & Journals', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'World Literature', 'European', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Movements', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Michel de Montaigne'], 'title": "The Complete Works (Everyman"s Library)", 'isbn13": "9781400040216", "msrp": 35, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1400040213", "isbn10": "1400040213"}}
