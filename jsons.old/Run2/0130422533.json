{"book": {"publisher": "Pearson", "synopsis": "This rigorous volume focuses on the underlying perspectives justifying the major approaches currently being used in educational research. Introductory chapters lay the foundation for exploring varying research perspectives. Nine specific perspectives on research—post positivism, pragmatism, constructivism, ethics and deliberate democracy, criticism, interpretivism, race/ethnicity/gender, arts-based research, and post structuralism—are examined, through discussions written by senior scholars known for their expertise in the perspective. And, a “guided tour” of criticism is given, in which these same scholars demonstrate the use of the “critical method” by critiquing six studies selected as exemplars of different research approaches. For education students who aspire to become researchers, and for those who simply need to read and understand research literature.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/25/38/9780130422538.jpg", "title_long": "Introduction to the Philosophies of Research and Criticism in Education and the Social Sciences", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 7.4 Inches, Weight: 1.34922904344 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.34922904344}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 360, "date_published": "2004-10-10", "subjects": ["Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Education Theory', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["James Paul'], 'title": "Introduction to the Philosophies of Research and Criticism in Education and the Social Sciences", "isbn13": "9780130422538", "msrp": 53.8, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0130422533", "isbn10": "0130422533"}}
