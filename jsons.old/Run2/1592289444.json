{"book": {"publisher": "Lyons Press", "synopsis": ""I hope The Long Walk will remain as a memorial to all those who live and die for freedom, and for all those who for many reasons could not speak for themselves."--Slavomir Rawicz<br/><br/>In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labor camp in Yakutsk--a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday feats. Their march--over thousands of miles by foot--out of Siberia, through China, the Gobi Desert, Tibet, and over the Himalayas to British India is a remarkable statement about man\"s desire to be free.<br/><br/>While the original book sold hundreds of thousands of copies, this updated paperback version includes a new Afterword by the author, as well as the author\'s Foreword to the Polish book. Written in a hauntingly detailed, no holds barred way, the new edition of The Long Walk is destined to outrank its classic status and guaranteed to forever stay in the reader\'s mind. *** Six-time Academy Awardâ€“nominee Peter Weir (Master and Commander, The Truman Show, and The Dead Poets Society) recently directed The Way Back, a much-anticipated film based on The Long Walk. Starring Colin Farrell, Jim Sturgess, and Ed Harris, it is due for release in 2011.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/48/9781592289448.jpg", "title_long": "Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom", "edition": "New edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.88 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.88}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2006-04-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'World War II', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Slavomir Rawicz'], 'title": "Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom", "isbn13": "9781592289448", "msrp": 16.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1592289444", "isbn10": "1592289444"}}
