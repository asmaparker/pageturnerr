The trouble begins when his beloved Priscilla Halburton-Smythe returns from London . . . with a fianc√© on her arm. His miseries multiply when clouds of midges (the diabolical Scottish mosquito) descend on the town. Then a paragon of housewifery named Trixie Thomas moves into Lochdubh with her lapdog husband in tow. The newcomer quickly convinces the local ladies to embrace low-cholesterol meals, ban tobacco, and begin bird-watching. Soon the town"s fish-and-chips-loving men are up in arms. Now faced with the trials of his own soul, Macbeth must solve Lochdubh"s newest crime-the mysterious poisoning of the perfect wife.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/33/9780446614733.jpg", "title_long": "Death of a Perfect Wife (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 4)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.2}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2006", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Traditional Detectives'], 'authors": ["M.
