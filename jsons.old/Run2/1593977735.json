{"book": {"publisher": "Macmillan Audio", "synopsis": "Cannell delivers non-stop action and intrigue in the latest installment of his New York Times bestselling Shane Scully series<br/>Shane Scully and his partner are assigned to the case of “the Fingertip Killer”—a serial murderer preying on homeless veterans in Los Angeles. Every two weeks he strikes: he beats his victims, then shoots them in the back of the head. Once they’re dead, he cuts off their fingertips, closes their eyes, and tosses them in the river.<br/><br/>The latest killing, however, does not quite fit the pattern. It appears to be the work of the Fingertip Killer, but Scully suspects an elaborate copycat murder meant to hide a criminal conspiracy. A bullet pulled from the victim’s skull produces what police call a “cold hit,” an unexpected ballistics match linking one unsolved case to another, and the previous victim was an LA Police officer, killed ten years earlier.<br/><br/>After heavy-handed FBI agents throw him off the Fingertip Killer case, Scully teams up with his wife and boss, Alexa, and a pair of tough cops from the LAPD’s anti-terrorism squad. Outside the law and deep undercover, they fight to see justice done for the slain officer, and, possibly, to unravel a murderous plot with connections high up in the Homeland Security office.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/33/9781593977733.jpg", "title_long": "Cold Hit: A Shane Scully Novel (Shane Scully Novels)", "edition": "Unabridged", "dimensions": "Height: 5.7 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 1.295 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.24}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.295}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.58}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.7}}, "pages": 11, "date_published": "2005-08-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors": ["Stephen J.
