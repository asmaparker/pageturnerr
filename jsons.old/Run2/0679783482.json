Modern thriller, Ramayan epic, courtroom drama, slapstick comedy, wartime adventure, political satire, village legend—they’re all blended here magnificently.”—The Washington Post Book World<br/><br/>“Absorbing . . . Everywhere [Rushdie] takes us there is both love and war, in strange and terrifying combinations, painted in swaying, swirling, world-eating prose that annihilates the borders between East and West, love and hate, private lives and the history they make.”—Time<br/><br/>This is the story of Maximilian Ophuls, America’ s counterterrorism chief, one of the makers of the modern world; his Kashmiri Muslim driver and subsequent killer, a mysterious figure who calls himself Shalimar the clown; Max’s illegitimate daughter India; and a woman who links them, whose revelation finally explains them all. It is an epic narrative that moves from California to Kashmir, France, and England, and back to California again. Along the way there are tales of princesses lured from their homes by demons, legends of kings forced to defend their kingdoms against evil. And there is always love, gained and lost, uncommonly beautiful and mortally dangerous.<br/><br/>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Washington Post Book World, Time, Los Angeles Times Book Review, Chicago Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Christian Science Monitor Rocky Mountain News", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/80/9780679783480.jpg", "title_long": "Shalimar the Clown: A Novel", "dimensions": "Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.67 Pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.89}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.67}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.95}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "2006-10-10", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Salman Rushdie'], 'title": "Shalimar the Clown: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780679783480", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0679783482", "isbn10": "0679783482"}}
