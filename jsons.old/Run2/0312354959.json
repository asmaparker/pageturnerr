{"book": {"publisher": "St. Martin"s Press", "synopsis": "The Junior League of Willow Creek, Texas, is tres exclusive. Undesirables need not apply. Fredericka Mercedes Hildebrand Ware (Frede to her friends) is a member beyond reproach...until her life begins to unravel. When her husband betrays her, steals her money, and runs off to places unknown, it\"s something Frede would rather keep under wraps. The last thing she needs is to become fodder for the JLWC gossip mill. And to make matters worse, there\"s only one person in town who stands a chance at helping her get revenge: Howard Grout, a tasteless, gold-chain-wearing lawyer who has bought his way into Frede\'s tony neighborhood. But htere\'s a price: She has to get his tacky, four-inch-stiletto-and-pink-spandex-wearing wife Nikki into the Junior League. Linda Francis Lee has written an hysterical novel about the creme de la creme of Texas society, the lengths to which one woman goes to bring her cheating husband to justice, and how taking on what seems like a 'Mission Impossible' can change you in ways you could never have imagined.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/54/9780312354954.jpg", "title_long": "The Devil in the Junior League", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.56 Inches, Length: 6.39 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.135 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.39}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.135}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.56}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2006-08-22", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Women's Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire'], 'authors": ["Linda Francis Lee'], 'title": "The Devil in the Junior League", "isbn13": "9780312354954", "msrp": 22.95, "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0312354959", "isbn10": "0312354959", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781429906463", "binding": "print"}]}}
