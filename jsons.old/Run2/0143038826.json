The White Man’s Burden is his widely anticipated counterpunch—a brilliant and blistering indictment of the West’s economic policies for the world’s poor. Sometimes angry, sometimes irreverent, but always clear-eyed and rigorous, Easterly argues that we in the West need to face our own history of ineptitude and draw the proper conclusions, especially at a time when the question of our ability to transplant Western institutions has become one of the most pressing issues we face.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/25/9780143038825.jpg", "title_long": "The White Man"s Burden: Why the West"s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good', 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.38 Inches, Length: 5.52 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.52}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.94}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.91}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.38}}, "pages": 448, "date_published": "2007-02-27", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic Conditions', 'International', 'Management & Leadership', 'Systems & Planning', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Poverty', 'Sociology', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["William Easterly'], 'title": "The White Man"s Burden: Why the West"s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good', 'isbn13": "9780143038825", "msrp": 15.98, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0143038826", "isbn10": "0143038826", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101218129", "binding": "print"}]}}
