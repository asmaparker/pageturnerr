{"book": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "synopsis": "Frances Burney"s first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine"s entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina"s innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions--as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville.<br/><br/>Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women's position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story. The new introduction and full notes to this edition help make this richness all the more readily available to a modern reader.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/18/9780192840318.jpg", "title_long": "Evelina (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 512, "date_published": "2002-07-18", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'British & Irish', 'Literary', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors": ["Frances Burney'], 'title": "Evelina (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'isbn13": "9780192840318", "msrp": 12.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0192840312", "isbn10": "0192840312"}}
