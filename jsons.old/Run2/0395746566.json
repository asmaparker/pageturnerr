There a boy makes friends with a mischievous little cloud, who whisks him away to the Cloud Dispatch Center for Sector 7 (the region that includes New York City). The clouds are bored with their everyday shapes, so the boy obligingly starts to sketch some new ones. . . . The wordless yet eloquent account of this unparalleled adventure is a funny, touching story about art, friendship, and the weather, as well as a visual tour de force.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/61/9780395746561.jpg", "title_long": "Sector 7: A Caldecott Honor Award Winner (Caldecott Honor Book)", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 9.25 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 0.415 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.415}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.25}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.75}}, "pages": 48, "date_published": "1999-09-20", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Arts, Music & Photography', 'Art', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Science, Nature & How It Works', 'Nature', 'Action & Adventure', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Science Fiction', 'Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["David Wiesner'], 'title": "Sector 7: A Caldecott Honor Award Winner (Caldecott Honor Book)", "isbn13": "9780395746561", "msrp": 17.99, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"eBook": "0547533144"}, "isbn": "0395746566", "isbn10": "0395746566", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780547533148", "binding": "print"}]}}
