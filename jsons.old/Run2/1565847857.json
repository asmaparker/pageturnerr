{"book": {"publisher": "New Press", "synopsis": "A landmark study that offers an alternative history of the Cold War from the point of view of the world\"s poor.<br/><br/>\""Europe' is morally, spiritually indefensible. And today the indictment is brought against it\x85by tens and tens of thousands of millions of men who, from the depths of slavery, set themselves up as judges.\'\x97Aimé Césaire, Discourse on Colonialism<br/><br/>Here, from a brilliant young writer, is a paradigm-shifting history of both a utopian concept and global movement\x97the idea of the Third World. The Darker Nations traces the intellectual origins and the political history of the twentieth century attempt to knit together the world\'s impoverished countries in opposition to the United States and Soviet spheres of influence in the decades following World War II.<br/><br/>Spanning every continent of the global South, Vijay Prashad\'s fascinating narrative takes us from the birth of postcolonial nations after World War II to the downfall and corruption of nationalist regimes. A breakthrough book of cutting-edge scholarship, it includes vivid portraits of Third World giants like India\'s Nehru, Egypt\'s Nasser, and Indonesia\'s Sukarno\x97as well as scores of extraordinary but now-forgotten intellectuals, artists, and freedom fighters. The Darker Nations restores to memory the vibrant though flawed idea of the Third World, whose demise, Prashad ultimately argues, has produced a much impoverished international political arena. 12 b/w photographs.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/59/9781565847859.jpg", "title_long": "The Darker Nations: A People"s History of the Third World", 'edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.64023922928 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.64023922928}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2007-01-28", "subjects": ["History', 'Africa', 'South Africa', 'Americas', 'Caribbean & West Indies', 'Native American', 'United States', 'Asia', 'India', 'Korea', 'Europe', 'Middle East', 'Israel & Palestine', 'Military', 'World', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Race Relations', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Political Science', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ["Vijay Prashad'], 'title": "The Darker Nations: A People"s History of the Third World", 'isbn13": "9781565847859", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1565847857", "isbn10": "1565847857", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781620977651", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
