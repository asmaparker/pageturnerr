Where I’m Calling From, his last collection, includes seven new works previously unpublished in book form. Together, these 37 stories give us a superb overview of Carver’s life work and show us why he was so widely imitated but never equaled.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/11/9780679722311.jpg", "title_long": "Where I"m Calling From: New and Selected Stories", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Weight: 0.9 Pounds", "dimensions_structured": {"weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.9}}, "pages": 526, "date_published": "1989", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["raymond-carver'], 'title": "Where I"m Calling From: New and Selected Stories", 'isbn13": "9780679722311", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101970596"}, "isbn": "0679722319", "isbn10": "0679722319", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101970591", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
