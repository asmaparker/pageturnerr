{"book": {"publisher": "Avon", "synopsis": "From the bestselling author of Jurassic Park, an epic tale of unspeakable horror<br/>The year is A.D. 922. A refined Arab courtier, representative of the powerful Caliph of Baghdad, encounters a party of Viking warriors who are journeying to the barbaric North. He is appalled by their Viking customs—the wanton sexuality of their pale, angular women, their disregard for cleanliness . . . their cold-blooded human sacrifices. But it is not until they reach the depths of the Northland that the courtier learns the horrifying and inescapable truth: he has been enlisted by these savage, inscrutable warriors to help combat a terror that plagues them—a monstrosity that emerges under cover of night to slaughter the Vikings and devour their flesh . . .<br/>“Crichton knows how to craft a tale, one that keeps the reader turning the pages.”—Houston Chronicle<br/>“Michael Crichton is one of our most gifted popular novelists. A true son of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. . . . A master of plausible and frightening scenarios. . . . He is a connoisseur of catastrophe.”—Los Angeles Times", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/15/65/9780060891565.jpg", "title_long": "Eaters of the Dead", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.1875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.76}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "2006-08-29", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Michael Crichton'], 'title": "Eaters of the Dead", "isbn13": "9780060891565", "msrp": 7.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0060891564", "isbn10": "0060891564"}}
