Now, at thirty-one, locked in a perpetual adolescence, he’s slipping. Even when he takes an artist-in-residence position at a small Oregon college, he finds himself still sleeping with strange women and seeking momentary oblivion in drugs. But when he returns to Manhattan with a new book idea and renewed energy, an emotional train wreck awaits him, and he discovers that he must take his first steps into his new life alone.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/80/9780684838380.jpg", "title_long": "Exile", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.5842249943 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5842249943}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "1997-06-11", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Blake Nelson'], 'title": "Exile", "isbn13": "9780684838380", "msrp": 19.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1439126011"}, "isbn": "0684838389", "isbn10": "0684838389", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781439126011", "binding": "print"}]}}
