{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "Chuck Palahniukâ€™s world has always been, well, different from yours and mine. In his first collection of nonfiction, Chuck Palahniuk brings us into this world, and gives us a glimpse of what inspires his fiction.At the Rock Creek Lodge Testicle Festival in Missoula, Montana, average people perform public sex acts on an outdoor stage. In a mansion once occupied by The Rolling Stones, Marilyn Manson reads his own Tarot cards and talks sweetly to his beautiful actress girlfriend. Across the country, men build their own full-size castles and rocketships that will send them into space. Palahniuk himself experiments with steroids, works on an assembly line by day and as a hospice volunteer by night, and experiences the brutal murder of his father by a white supremacist. With this new direction, Chuck Palahniuk has proven he can do anything.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/23/9780385722223.jpg", "title_long": "Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.61 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.61}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2005-05-10", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Reference', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Biographies', 'Boxing, Wrestling & MMA', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Chuck Palahniuk'], 'title": "Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories", "isbn13": "9780385722223", "msrp": 15.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307275035"}, "isbn": "0385722222", "isbn10": "0385722222", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307275035", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
