{"book": {"publisher": "Chronicle Books", "synopsis": "At the dawn of the Middle Ages, a gripping tale of chivalry and suspense emerges. Two distinguished knights -- one Saxon, one Norman -- have returned from the Crusades. Though they fought on the same side, they now have a score to settle. What begins as a joust between two rivals quickly escalates into clanwide mayhem and a fast-paced series of battles for revenge, honor, and love.<br/>Sir Walter Scott"s Ivanhoe was one of the first great historical novels of western literature. At last, this extraordinary work has been brought to life as a lavishly illustrated storybook. Marianna Mayer"s inspired adaptation combined with magnificent oil paintings by John Rush create an essential introduction to the classic. This exquisitely designed page-turning volume is perfect for anyone with a passion for adventure.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/89/9781587172489.jpg", "title_long": "Ivanhoe", "edition": "Abridged edition", "dimensions": "Height: 10.3 Inches, Length: 8.4 Inches, Weight: 0.44 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.44}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.3}}, "pages": 56, "date_published": "2004-09-30", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics'], 'authors": ["Marianna Mayer'], 'title": "Ivanhoe", "isbn13": "9781587172489", "msrp": 17.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1587172488", "isbn10": "1587172488"}}
