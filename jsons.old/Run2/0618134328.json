{"book": {"publisher": "Mariner Books", "synopsis": "From one of America"s most distinguished historians comes this classic analysis of Richard Nixon. By considering some of the president"s opinions, Wills comes to the controversial conclusion that Nixon was actually a liberal. Both entertaining and essential, Nixon Agonistes captures a troubled leader and a struggling nation mired in a foolish Asian war, forfeiting the loyalty of its youth, puzzled by its own power, and looking to its cautious president for confidence. In the end, Nixon Agonistes reaches far beyond its assessment of the thirty-seventh president to become an incisive and provocative analysis of the American political machine.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/28/9780618134328.jpg", "title_long": "Nixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the Self-Made Man", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 inches, Length: 5.5 inches, Weight: 1.79 Pounds, Width: 1.5 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.79}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 640, "date_published": "2002-11-14", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Asia', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'Presidents & Heads of State', 'History', 'Americas', 'Vietnam War', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Garry Wills'], 'title": "Nixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the Self-Made Man", "isbn13": "9780618134328", "msrp": 33.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0618134328", "isbn10": "0618134328"}}
