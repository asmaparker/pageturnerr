{"book": {"publisher": ""Harry N. Abrams, Inc."", 'synopsis": "Photographs from the archives of Getty Images, London, by a wide variety of photographers, including Robert Whitaker<br/><br/>The Beatles: 365 Days is a dazzling photographic survey-in 425 black-and-white and color images, most of which are rarely or never before seen-that follows the Beatles through the arc of their spectacular career from 1963 to 1970. Arranged chronologically, the photos trace the story of the band, from their emergence on the scene in England, through their rise to international superstardom, to their very public breakup in 1970. Every aspect of their evolution from mop-tops to legends is depicted, including their personal lives, performances, press conferences, recording sessions, public appearances, photo sessions, filmmaking, and more. The captions by Simon Wells are rich in detail and provide both band history and cultural context for the photographs, as well as quotes from members of the band and those associated with them that have never been published.<br/><br/>The insatiable hunger for new books about the Beatles has never waned, and this arresting volume-with its wealth of never- and seldom-seen pictures that have long been embargoed at the Getty Images archive-will have a special appeal for all Beatles fans.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/18/9780810959118.jpg", "title_long": "The Beatles: 365 Days", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 4.45 Pounds, Width: 2.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 4.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 744, "date_published": "2005-11-01", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Photography & Video', 'Portraits', 'Music', 'Musical Genres'], 'authors": ["Simon Wells'], 'title": "The Beatles: 365 Days", "isbn13": "9780810959118", "msrp": 32.5, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0810959119", "isbn10": "0810959119"}}
