{"book": {"publisher": "Lark Crafts", "synopsis": "Diverse, extensive, and incredibly beautiful, this awe-inspiring collection features the most magnificent rings ever. With designs that range from the traditional to the very avant-garde, each of the 1,000 examples is an exceptional work of art, finely crafted by the best contemporary jewelers. Rob Jackson mixes antique industrial elements (a 100-year-old wrought iron nail) with radiant 20-karat gold and a glowing ruby for a dynamic visual contrast. Tomomi Aratâ€™s collection, Treasure from Under the Sea, captures the exoticism of ocean life: he uses pearls, enamel, and sand to create rings that look as if they were chiseled directly out of a coral reef. Among the prestigious artisans represented: Arline M. Fisch, Michael Zobel, Katja Prins, Paul Preston, and Bruce Metcalf.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/88/9781579905088.jpg", "title_long": "1000 Rings: Inspiring Adornments for the Hand (500 Series)", "edition": "Edition Unstated", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 2.55 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Crafts & Hobbies', 'Jewelry & Beadwork'], 'authors": ["Marthe Le Van', 'Robert W.
