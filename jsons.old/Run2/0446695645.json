{"book": {"publisher": "Grand Central Publishing", "synopsis": "Once a hotshot investigative reporter, Jack Tagger now bangs out obituaries for a South Florida daily, "plotting to resurrect my career by yoking my byline to some famous stiff." Jimmy Stoma, the infamous front man of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, dead in a fishy-smelling scuba "accident' may be just the stiff Jack needs-if only he can figure out what happened. Standing in the way are [among others] an editor who wants Jack to 'break her cherry,' Stoma\'s ambitious pop-singer widow, and the soulless, profit-hungry newspaper owner Jack once publicly humiliated. As clues from Stoma\'s music give Jack Tagger the chance to trade obits for a story that could hit the front page, murder gives his career a new lease on life.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/40/9780446695640.jpg", "title_long": "Basket Case", "edition": "Later Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "2005-02-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Carl Hiaasen'], 'title": "Basket Case", "isbn13": "9780446695640", "msrp": 14.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0446695645", "isbn10": "0446695645"}}
