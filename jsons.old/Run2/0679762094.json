{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "This is the extraordinary first-person account of a young woman"s coming of age in Somalia and her struggles against the obligations and strictures of family and society. By the time she is nine, Aman has undergone a ritual circumcision ceremony; at eleven, her innocent romance with a white boy leads to a murder; at thirteen she is given away in an arranged marriage to a stranger. Aman eventually runs away to Mogadishu, where her beauty and rebellious spirit leads her to the decadent demimonde of white colonialists. Hers is a world in which women are both chattel and freewheeling entrepreneurs, subject to the caprices of male relatives, yet keenly aware of the loopholes that lead to freedom. Aman is an astonishing history, opening a window onto traditional Somali life and the universal quest for female self-awareness.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/96/9780679762096.jpg", "title_long": "Aman: The Story of a Somali Girl", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.93 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.6625 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.78}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.6625}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.93}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "1995-08-29", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Historical', 'Africa', 'History', 'Central Africa', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Women's Studies', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": [], "title": "Aman: The Story of a Somali Girl", "isbn13": "9780679762096", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307554341"}, "isbn": "0679762094", "isbn10": "0679762094", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307554345", "binding": "print"}]}}
