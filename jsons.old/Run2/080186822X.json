{"book": {"publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "synopsis": "How does ADHD manifest itself in adult life? In general, the authors write, hyperactivity tends to diminish with age, impulsivity changes quality, and attention problems remain the same although they may become more disabling as organizational demands increase. The authors carefully answer the questions often posed by professionals and patients about these symptoms and other issues. They describe the diagnostic interview and the use of rating scales and include examples of the scales. They also provide a well-balanced review of associated psychiatric conditions, such as mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette"s syndrome, oppositional and conduct problems, and substance abuse. Descriptions of all the primary approaches to treatment―medication, psychological therapies, and environmental restructuring―include vivid case examples.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/21/9780801868221.jpg", "title_long": "ADHD in Adulthood: A Guide to Current Theory, Diagnosis, and Treatment (A Johns Hopkins Press Health Book)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.25002102554 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.88}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.25002102554}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 376, "date_published": "2001-12-07", "subjects": ["Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Attention Deficit & Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Disabilities & Hyperactivity', 'Disabilities', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Test Preparation & Review', 'Psychology', 'Pathologies', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Margaret Weiss MD PhD', 'Lily Trokenberg Hechtman MDCM', 'Gabrielle Weiss MDCM'], 'title": "ADHD in Adulthood: A Guide to Current Theory, Diagnosis, and Treatment (A Johns Hopkins Press Health Book)", "isbn13": "9780801868221", "msrp": 25.95, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "080186822X", "isbn10": "080186822X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781421401317", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
