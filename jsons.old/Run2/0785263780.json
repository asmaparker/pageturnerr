{"book": {"publisher": "Thomas Nelson Inc", "synopsis": "Ireland, 1830s. It was a time when English landlords held power over Irish tenant farmers and seeds of bitterness were sown that would last for generations.<br/>In an endeavor to eliminate all influences of Irish heritage, the English forced an intellectual and spiritual bondage on Ireland as well as a bitter physical bondage of servitude. Freedom had become so rare that the Irish coined a saying, "In Ireland only the rivers run free." Yet one poor, befuddled old woman speaks of freedom, truth, and hope. Mad Molly Fahey promises the priest and villages that a miracle is on its way.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/84/9780785263784.jpg", "title_long": "Only the River Runs Free (Galway Chronicles, Book 1)", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.68 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.68}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 269, "date_published": "2003", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["Bodie Thoene', 'Brock Thoene'], 'title": "Only the River Runs Free (Galway Chronicles, Book 1)", "isbn13": "9780785263784", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0785263780", "isbn10": "0785263780"}}
