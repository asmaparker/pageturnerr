{"book": {"publisher": "Dalkey Archive Press", "synopsis": "The Last Days is Raymond Queneau"s autobiographical novel of Parisian student life in the 1920s: Vincent Tuquedenne tries to reconcile his love for reading with the sterility of studying as he hopes to study his way out of the petite bourgeoisie to which he belongs. Vincent and his generation are contrasted with an older generation of retired teachers and petty crooks, and both generations come under the bemused gaze of the waiter Alfred, whose infallible method of predicting the future mocks prevailing scientific models. Similarly, Queneau"s literary universe operates under its own laws, joining rigorous artistry with a warm evocation of the last days of a bygone world.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/06/9781564781406.jpg", "title_long": "Last Days (French Literature)", "edition": "2nd ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 8.45 Inches, Length: 5.49 Inches, Weight: 0.79807338844 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.49}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.73}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.79807338844}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.45}}, "pages": 250, "date_published": "1996-09-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Biographical', 'Literary'], 'authors": ['Raymond Queneau', 'R Queneau'], 'title": "Last Days (French Literature)", "isbn13": "9781564781406", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1564781402", "isbn10": "1564781402"}}
