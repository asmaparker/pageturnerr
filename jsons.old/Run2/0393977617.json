Based on events that took place in 1946 in the ancient Yoruban city of Oyo, Soyinka\"s acclaimed and powerful play addresses classic issues of cultural conflict, tragic decision-making, and the psychological mindsets of individuals and groups. The text of the play is accompanied by an introduction and explanatory annotations for the many allusions to traditional Nigerian myth and culture. "Backgrounds and Sources' helps readers understand Death and the King\'s Horseman\'s traditional African contexts and the role of theater in African culture. Included are a map of Yoruba-land, discussions of Yoruban religious beliefs and cultural traditions, Soyinka on the various forms that theater has taken in African culture in order to survive, and Anthony Appiah on Soyinka\'s struggle with the problem of African identity in the creation of Death and the King\'s Horseman.
