{"book": {"publisher": "Modern Library", "synopsis": "This collection, unique to the Modern Library, gathers seven of Dostoevsky"s key works and shows him to be equally adept at the short story as with the novel. Exploring many of the same themes as in his longer works, these small masterpieces move from the tender and romantic White Nights, an archetypal nineteenth-century morality tale of pathos and loss, to the famous Notes from the Underground, a story of guilt, ineffectiveness, and uncompromising cynicism, and the first major work of existential literature. Among Dostoevsky"s prototypical characters is Yemelyan in The Honest Thief, whose tragedy turns on an inability to resist crime. Presented in chronological order, in David Magarshack"s celebrated translation, this is the definitive edition of Dostoevsky's best stories.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/87/9780375756887.jpg", "title_long": "The Best Short Stories of Fyodor Dostoevsky (Modern Library)", "edition": "MODERN LIB", "dimensions": "Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.48722159902 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.64}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.48722159902}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.96}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2001-02-13", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Fyodor Dostoevsky'], 'title": "The Best Short Stories of Fyodor Dostoevsky (Modern Library)", "isbn13": "9780375756887", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "030782408X"}, "isbn": "0375756884", "isbn10": "0375756884", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307824080", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
