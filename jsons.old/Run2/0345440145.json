Margaret Cho displays her numerous sides in this funny, fierce, and honest memoir. As one of the country’s most visible Asian Americans, she has a unique perspective on identity and acceptance. As one of the country’s funniest and most quoted personalities, she takes no prisoners. And as a warm and wise woman who has seen the highs and lows of life, she has words of encouragement for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. With I’m the One That I Want, Margaret Cho has written a book every bit as hilarious, shocking, and insightful as she is.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/43/9780345440143.jpg", "title_long": "I"m the One That I Want", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.46958461806 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.46958461806}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.2}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2002-04-30", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Margaret Cho'], 'title": "I"m the One That I Want", 'isbn13": "9780345440143", "msrp": 13.19, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307415600"}, "isbn": "0345440145", "isbn10": "0345440145", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307415608", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
