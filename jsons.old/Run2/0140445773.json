{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "In Either/Or, using the voices of two characters—the aesthetic young man of part one, called simply "A,' and the ethical Judge Vilhelm of the second section—Kierkegaard reflects upon the search for a meaningful existence, contemplating subjects as diverse as Mozart, drama, boredom, and, in the famous Seducer\'s Diary, the cynical seduction and ultimate rejection of a young, beautiful woman. A masterpiece of duality, Either/Or is a brilliant exploration of the conflict between the aesthetic and the ethical - both meditating ironically and seductively upon Epicurean pleasures, and eloquently expounding the noble virtues of a morally upstanding life.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
