{"book": {"publisher": "Blackwell Publishers", "synopsis": "The Ideology of the Aesthetic presents a history and critique of the concept of the aesthetic throughout modern Western thought. As such, this is a critical survey of modern Western philosophy, focusing in particular on the complex relations between aesthetics, ethics and politics. Eagleton provides a brilliant and challenging introduction to these concerns, as characterized in the work of Kant, Schiller, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Lukacs, Adorno, Habermas, and others.<br/><br/>Wide in span, as well as morally and politically committed, this is Terry Eagleton"s major work to date. It forms both an original enquiry and an exemplary introduction.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/22/9780631163022.jpg", "title_long": "The Ideology of the Aesthetic", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.999982 Inches, Length: 5.999988 Inches, Weight: 1.53000809828 Pounds, Width: 1.29921 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.999988}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.29921}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.53000809828}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.999982}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "1991-01-08", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Politics & Government', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Terry Eagleton'], 'title": "The Ideology of the Aesthetic", "isbn13": "9780631163022", "msrp": 49.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0631163026", "isbn10": "0631163026"}}
