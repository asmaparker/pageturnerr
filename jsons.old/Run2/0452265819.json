Iris Courtney, who is white, is the only witness when handsome Jinx Fairchild, a black basketball player, kills a white man in order to protect her.<br/><br/>The secret link between Iris and Jinx is not only their attraction to each other, but a bond of passion and guilt that has formed between them. This one irrevocable, tragic act shapes their lives and alters their destinies in Joyce Carol Oates’s finest, emotion-packed novel—a work critics call a masterpiece, the best work of America’s best writer of contemporary realism.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/13/9780452265813.jpg", "title_long": "Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart", "edition": "~", "dimensions": "Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.92}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.96}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "1991-03-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Tragedy', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Joyce Carol Oates'], 'title": "Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart", "isbn13": "9780452265813", "msrp": 13.35, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0452265819", "isbn10": "0452265819"}}
