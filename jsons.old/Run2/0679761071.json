{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "Junichiro Tanizaki’s Seven Japanese Tales collects stories that explore the boundary at which love becomes self-annihilation, where the contemplation of beauty gives way to fetishism, and where tradition becomes an instrument of voluptuous cruelty.<br/><br/>A beautiful blind musician exacts the ultimate sacrifice from the man who is both her disciple and her lover. A tattooist turns the body of an exquisite young girl into a reflection of her predatory inner nature. A young man is erotically imprisoned by memories of his absent mother. Shocking in its content and lyrical in its beauty, these stories represent some of the finest work of one of Japan’s greatest modern writers.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/75/9780679761075.jpg", "title_long": "Seven Japanese Tales", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.93 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.24}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.72}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.58}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.93}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "1996-10-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Historical'], 'authors": ["Junichiro Tanizaki'], 'title": "Seven Japanese Tales", "isbn13": "9780679761075", "msrp": 17, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0679761071", "isbn10": "0679761071"}}
