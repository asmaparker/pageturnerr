{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "What do suicidal pandas, doped-up rock stars, and a naked Pamela Anderson have in common? They’re all a heck of a lot more interesting than reading about predicate nominatives and hyphens. June Casagrande knows this and has invented a whole new twist on the grammar book. Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies is a laugh-out-loud funny collection of anecdotes and essays on grammar and punctuation, as well as hilarious critiques of the self-appointed language experts.<br/>Chapters include:<br/>I’m Writing This While Naked—The Oh-So Steamy Predicate Nominative<br/>Semicolonoscopy—Colons, Semicolons, Dashes, and Other Probing Annoyances<br/>I’ll Take "I Feel Like a Moron" for $200, Alex—When to Put Punctuation Inside Quotation Marks<br/>Snobbery Up with Which You Should Not Put Up—Prepositions<br/>Is That a Dangler in Your Memo or Are You Just Glad to See Me?<br/>Hyphens—Life-Sucking, Mom-and-Apple-Pie-Hating, Mime-Loving, Nerd-Fight-Inciting Daggers of the Damned<br/>Casagrande delivers practical and fun language lessons not found anywhere else, demystifying the subject and taking it back from the snobs. In short, it’s a grammar book people will actually want to read—just for the fun of it.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/38/9780143036838.jpg", "title_long": "Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite", "edition": "2/26/06", "dimensions": "Height: 7.15 Inches, Length: 0.57 Inches, Weight: 0.34 Pounds, Width: 5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.57}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.34}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.15}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2006-03-28", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Business & Professional', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Grammar', 'Vocabulary, Slang & Word Lists', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Research'], 'authors": ["June Casagrande'], 'title": "Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite", "isbn13": "9780143036838", "msrp": 15, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101221380"}, "isbn": "0143036831", "isbn10": "0143036831", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101221389", "binding": "print"}]}}
