{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "This Vintage Classics edition of James Joyceâ€™s groundbreaking story collection has been authoritatively edited by scholars Hans Walter Gabler and Walter Hettche and includes a chronology, bibliography, and afterword by John S. Kelly. Also included in a special appendix are the original versions of three of the stories as well as Joyce\"s long-suppressed preface to Dubliners.<br/><br/>With the fifteen stories in Dubliners Joyce reinvented the art of fiction, using a scrupulous, deadpan realism to convey truths that were at once blasphemous and sacramental. Whether writing about the death of a fallen priest ("The Sisters"), the petty sexual and fiscal machinations of 'Two Gallants,' or of the Christmas party at which an uprooted intellectual discovers just how little he really knows about his wife ('The Dead'), Joyce takes narrative art to places it had never been before.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/77/49/9780140247749.jpg", "title_long": "Dubliners: Text and Criticism; Revised Edition (Critical Library, Viking)", "edition": "Revised ed.", "dimensions": "Height: 7.72 inches, Length: 5.11 inches, Weight: 0.87523518014 Pounds, Width: 1.05 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.11}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.05}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.87523518014}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.72}}, "pages": 512, "date_published": "1996-08-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["James Joyce'], 'title": "Dubliners: Text and Criticism; Revised Edition (Critical Library, Viking)", "isbn13": "9780140247749", "msrp": 20, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140247742", "isbn10": "0140247742"}}
