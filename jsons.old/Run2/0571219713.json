The object of her growing obsession is her roommate, Lucy Blake, and Lucy"s friendship with her new and disturbing classmate. Ernessa is a mysterious, moody presence with pale skin and hypnotic eyes. Around her swirl dark rumours, suspicions and secrets as well as a series of ominous disasters. As fear spreads through the school, what is true and what is dreamed bleed together into a waking nightmare of gothic menace, fuelled by the anxieties, lusts and fears of adolescence. At the centre of the diary is the question that haunts all who read it: Is Ernessa really a vampire? Or has the narrator trapped herself in her own fevered imagination?", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/11/9780571219711.jpg", "title_long": "The Moth Diaries", "edition": "Children"s Ed", 'dimensions": "Height: 7.75589 Inches, Length: 4.96062 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.62992 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.96062}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.62992}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.440924524}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75589}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors": ['Rachel Klein'], 'title": "The Moth Diaries", "isbn13": "9780571219711", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0571219713", "isbn10": "0571219713"}}
