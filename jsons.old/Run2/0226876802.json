{"book": {"publisher": "University Of Chicago Press", "synopsis": "In what has become a classic work, Richard M. Weaver unsparingly diagnoses the ills of our age and offers a realistic remedy. He asserts that the world is intelligible, and that man is free. The catastrophes of our age are the product not of necessity but of unintelligent choice. A cure, he submits, is possible. It lies in the right use of man"s reason, in the renewed acceptance of an absolute reality, and in the recognition that ideas—like actions—have consequences.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/01/9780226876801.jpg", "title_long": "Ideas Have Consequences", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.6}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 198, "date_published": "1984-09-28", "subjects": ["Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Richard M.
