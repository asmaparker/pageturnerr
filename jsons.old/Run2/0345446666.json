{"book": {"publisher": "Ballantine Books", "synopsis": "On the East Anglican seacoast a small theological college hangs precariously on an eroding shoreline and an equally precarious future. Then, the body of a student is found buried in the sand, and the boy’s influential father demands that Scotland Yard investigate. Adam Dalgleish, the son of a parson, once spent happy summers at the school. A detective who loves poetry, a man who has known loss and discovery, Dalgliesh is the perfect candidate to look for the truth in a remote, rarified community of the faithful–and the frightened. For when one death leads to another, Dalgliesh finds himself steeped in a world of good and evil, of stifled passions and hidden pasts, where someone has cause not just to commit one crime, but to begin an unholy order of murder. . . .", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/64/9780345446664.jpg", "title_long": "Death in Holy Orders (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #11)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.88 Inches, Length: 4.17 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1.16 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.17}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.16}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.88}}, "pages": 448, "date_published": "2002-03-26", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["P.
