But recently the pollution from the outside world has grown ever greater, and young Gary Gar, latest in a long line of gargoyle guardians, is finding it ever more difficult to fulfill his responsibilities.<br/><br/>So Gary does what any sensible Xanth resident with a dire dilemma would do. He goes to see the Good Magician Humfrey, who sends him on a peculiar quest--to transform himself into human shape, tutor a precocious child with more than her share of wild magical talents, and find a philter which can restore the river to its previous pristine state.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/56/9780812534856.jpg", "title_long": "Geis of the Gargoyle (Xanth, No. 18)", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 6.74 Inches, Length: 4.28 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.895 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.28}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.895}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.74}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "1995-10-15", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Piers Anthony'], 'title": "Geis of the Gargoyle (Xanth, No. 18)", "isbn13": "9780812534856", "msrp": 1.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0812534859", "isbn10": "0812534859"}}
