{"book": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "synopsis": "Thomas Hardy is among the best-loved of the great English poets, perhaps drawing his great popularity from the elegaic tone of much of his finest verse and the universality of his subject matter: birth, childhood, love, marriage, age, and death. Those elegies inspired by the death of his first wife Emma are some of his best, and are well represented in this new selection of his verse. Prepared by Samuel Hynes, the editor of the definitive Oxford English Texts Complete Works of Thomas Hardy, this volume includes a selection of Hardy"s poetry that spans his life, verses that influenced later poets as diverse as Robert Graves and Philip Larkin, Ezra Pound and W.H. Auden.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/11/9780192834911.jpg", "title_long": "Selected Poetry (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "1999-05-06", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Gerard Manley Hopkins'], 'title": "Selected Poetry (Oxford World"s Classics)", 'isbn13": "9780192834911", "msrp": 10.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0192834916", "isbn10": "0192834916"}}
