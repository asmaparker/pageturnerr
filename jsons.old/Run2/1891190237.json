{"book": {"publisher": "Atelos", "synopsis": "Poetry. African American Studies. Ed Roberson might no longer live in Pittsburgh, but the city in which he was born and raised still leaves its fragmented structures etched throughout his poetry. A city of hard work and hard times, the now-impoverished neighborhoods that had at one time stood as centers of jazz and art; the hills, the rivers, the skyscraping iron and steel, and the pain. Though most of the poems in this collection do not necessarily take place in Pittsburgh, there is a rhythmic fragmentation here painting portraits of urban life in general. Beauty, music, poverty, blood, and concrete seem to live within the line breaks, while breath-stopping pauses halt you just long enough so that--like at a smoky backroom jazz club--you can"t wait to see what he does next.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/30/9781891190230.jpg", "title_long": "City Eclogue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 136, "date_published": "2006-01-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies'], 'authors": ["Ed Roberson'], 'title": "City Eclogue", "isbn13": "9781891190230", "msrp": 12.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1891190237", "isbn10": "1891190237"}}
