{"book": {"publisher": "City Lights Publishers", "synopsis": "Exceptional stories that come pounding out of Bukowski\"s violent and depraved life. Horrible and holy, you cannot read them and ever come away the same again.<br/>This collection of stories was once part of the 1972 City Lights classic, Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions and General Tales of Ordinary Madness. That book was later split into two volumes and republished: The Most Beautiful Woman in Town and, this book, Tales of Ordinary Madness.<br/>With Bukowski, the votes are still coming in. There seems to be no middle ground—people seem either to love him or hate him. Tales of his own life and doings are as wild and weird as the very stories he writes. In a sense, Bukowski was a legend in his time, a madman, a recluse, a lover; tender, vicious; never the same.<br/>"Bukowski … a professional disturber of the peace … laureate of Los Angeles netherworld [writes with] crazy romantic insistence that losers are less phony than winners, and with an angry compassion for the lost."—Jack Kroll, Newsweek<br/>'Bukowski’s works are extraordinarily vivid and often bitterly funny observations of people living on the very edge of oblivion. His poetry, in all its glorious simplicity, was accessible the way poetry seldom is a testament to his genius.'—Nick Burton, PIF Magazine', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/58/9780872861558.jpg", "title_long": "Tales of Ordinary Madness", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 238, "date_published": "1984-01-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Charles Bukowski'], 'title": "Tales of Ordinary Madness", "isbn13": "9780872861558", "msrp": 15.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0872866386"}, "isbn": "0872861554", "isbn10": "0872861554", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780872866386", "binding": "print"}]}}
