{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial", "synopsis": "From legendary writer Denis Johnson, The Stars at Noon is a novel of mystery and suspense set during the Nicaraguan Revolution—now a major motion picture produced by A24 and starring Joe Alwyn.<br/>Set in Nicaragua in 1984, The Stars at Noon is a story of passion, fear, and betrayal told in the voice of an American woman whose mission in Central America is as shadowy as her surroundings. Is she a reporter for an American magazine, as she sometimes claims, or a contact person for Eyes for Peace? And who is the rough English businessman with whom she becomes involved? As the two foreigners become entangled in increasingly sinister plots, Denis Johnson masterfully dramatizes a powerful vision of spiritual bereavement and corruption.<br/>"A daring novel... Denis Johnson is one of our most inventive, unpredictable novelists."—The New York Times Book Review", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/61/01/9780060976101.jpg", "title_long": "The Stars at Noon", "edition": "F First Paperback Edition Used", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 0.5 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 5.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "1995-03-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Hispanic', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Denis Johnson'], 'title": "The Stars at Noon", "isbn13": "9780060976101", "msrp": 12.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060976101", "isbn10": "0060976101"}}
