It was a girl driving, a girl with a shocking pink scarf tied round her hair. And if there was one thing that set James Bond really moving, it was being passed at speed by a pretty girl.<br/>When Bond rescues a beautiful, reckless girl from self-destruction, he finds himself with a lead on one of the most dangerous men in the world—Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. In the snow-bound fastness of his Alpine base, Blofeld is conducting research that could threaten the safety of the world. To thwart the evil genius, Bond must get himself and the vital information he has gathered out of the base and keep away from SPECTRE"s agents.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/32/51/9780142003251.jpg", "title_long": "On Her Majesty"s Secret Service (James Bond Novels)", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.49 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.49}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "2003-09-02", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Contemporary', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Ian Fleming'], 'title": "On Her Majesty"s Secret Service (James Bond Novels)", 'isbn13": "9780142003251", "msrp": 15, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0142003255", "isbn10": "0142003255"}}
