{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial Modern Classics", "synopsis": 'Billy Budd, Sailor and Bartleby, the Scrivener are two of the most revered shorter works of fiction in history. Here, they are collected along with 19 other stories in a beautifully redesigned collection that represents the best short work of an American master.As Warner Berthoff writes in his introduction to this volume,
        "It is hard to think of a major novelist or storyteller who is not also a first-rate entertainer ... a master, according to choice, of high comedy, of one or another robust species of expressive humour, or of some special variety of the preposterous, the grotesque, the absurd. And Melville, certainly, is no exception. A kind of vigorous supervisory humour is his natural idiom as a writer, and one particular attraction of his shorter work is the fresh further display it offers of this prime element in his literary character."', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/65/46/9780060586546.jpg", "title_long": "Great Short Works of Herman Melville (Perennial Classics)", "edition": "First Perennial Classics Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.9479877266 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.82}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.9479877266}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 512, "date_published": "2004-03-02", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Herman Melville'], 'title": "Great Short Works of Herman Melville (Perennial Classics)", "isbn13": "9780060586546", "msrp": 9.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "006176079X", "ePub": "006176079X"}, "isbn": "0060586540", "isbn10": "0060586540", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061760792", "binding": "print"}]}}
