Sissman ranked with Liebling and Mencken, who Geoffrey Wolff said "is bringing his work to levels that have no measurable limit," who has been called 'a master craftsman' so many times that it is pointless to number them.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/71/99/9780374517199.jpg", "title_long": "The John McPhee Reader", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 8.1999836 Inches, Length: 5.4499891 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4499891}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.05}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.1999836}}, "pages": 416, "date_published": "1982-06-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'United States', 'Anthologies', 'Contemporary', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Miscellaneous', 'Journalism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John McPhee'], 'title": "The John McPhee Reader", "isbn13": "9780374517199", "msrp": 22, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0374517193", "isbn10": "0374517193"}}
