{"book": {"publisher": "Ivy Books", "synopsis": "Patty Jane Dobbin should have known better than to marry a man as gorgeous as Thor Rolvaag, but she was too smitten to think twice. Yet nine months into their marriage, with a baby on the way, Thor is gone. It"s a good thing Patty Jane has her irrepressible sister, Harriet, to rely on. For it"s been said that a fine haircut can cure any number of ills, and before long the Minnesota sisters have opened a neighborhood beauty parlor complete with live harp music and an endless supply of delicious Norwegian baked goods. It"s a wonderful, warmhearted place where you can count on good friends, lots of laughter, tears, and comfort when you need it--and the unmistakable scent of somebody getting a permanent wave. . . .', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/08/9780804114608.jpg", "title_long": "Patty Jane"s House of Curl", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 6.84 Inches, Length: 4.17 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.17}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.82}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.84}}, "pages": 304, "date_published": "1999-06-28", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Psychological', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Lorna Landvik'], 'title": "Patty Jane"s House of Curl", 'isbn13": "9780804114608", "msrp": 6.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0804114609", "isbn10": "0804114609"}}
