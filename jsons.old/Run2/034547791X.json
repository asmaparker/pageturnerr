The trail leads to a small town reminiscent of Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century, a place where the ghostly image of a golden-haired woman comes in the night to steal the town’s children. Syaoran and his band of outrageous friends–affable Fai D. Flowright, loose cannon Kurogane, the odd creature Mokona, and Sakura herself–mount their horses and venture into forbidding, barren woods to solve a mystery, rescue the children, and retrieve one more piece of Sakura’s missing memories.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/10/9780345477910.jpg", "title_long": "Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 4", "edition": "4", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2005-01-25", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Clamp'], 'title": "Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 4", "isbn13": "9780345477910", "msrp": 8.8, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "034547791X", "isbn10": "034547791X"}}
