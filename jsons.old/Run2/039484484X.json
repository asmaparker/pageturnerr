Written in unrhymed prose, The 500 Hats is one of Dr. Seuss"s earliest works, and while it may not be as well-known as his other stories, the book addresses subjects that we know the good doctor was passionate about throughout his life: the abuse of power (as in Yertle the Turtle and Horton Hears a Who); rivalry (as in The Sneetches); and of course, zany good humor (as in The Cat in the Hat and all the other books he wrote and illustrated)!", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/48/9780394844848.jpg", "title_long": "The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins (Classic Seuss)", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 11.31 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 0.82 Pounds, Width: 0.38 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.38}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.82}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 11.31}}, "pages": 56, "date_published": "1989-12-09", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Chapter Books & Readers', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Dr. Seuss'], 'title": "The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins (Classic Seuss)", "isbn13": "9780394844848", "msrp": 16.99, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"ePub": "038537349X"}, "isbn": "039484484X", "isbn10": "039484484X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780385373494", "binding": "print"}]}}
