"With bald honesty and brutal lyricism" (Elle), the anonymous author depicts her fellow Berliners in all their humanity, as well as their cravenness, corrupted first by hunger and then by the Russians. 'Spare and unpredictable, minutely observed and utterly free of self-pity' (The Plain Dealer, Cleveland), A Woman in Berlin tells of the complex relationship between civilians and an occupying army and the shameful indignities to which women in a conquered city are always subject--the mass rape suffered by all, regardless of age or infirmity.<br/><br/>A Woman in Berlin stands as 'one of the essential books for understanding war and life' (A. S. Byatt, author of Possession).', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/18/9780312426118.jpg", "title_long": "A Woman in Berlin: Eight Weeks in the Conquered City: A Diary", "dimensions": "Height: 8.15 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.8499983 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8499983}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.15}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "2006-07-11", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'Germany', 'World War II', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Women's Studies', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Anonymous'], 'title": "A Woman in Berlin: Eight Weeks in the Conquered City: A Diary", "isbn13": "9780312426118", "msrp": 19, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312426119", "isbn10": "0312426119", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781250156754", "binding": "print"}]}}
