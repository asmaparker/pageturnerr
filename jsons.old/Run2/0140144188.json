        1951, John Steinbeck warmed up to the work of writing East of Eden with a letter to the late Pascal Covici, his friend and editor at The Viking Press. It was his way, he said, of "getting my mental arm in shape to pitch a good game."<br/><br/>Steinbeck\'s letters were written on the left-hand pages of a notebook in which the facing pages would be filled with the test of East of Eden. They touched on many subjects—story arguments, trial flights of workmanship, concern for his sons.<br/>Part autobiography, part writer\'s workshop, these letters offer an illuminating perspective on Steinbeck\'s creative process, and a fascinating glimpse of Steinbeck, the private man.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/41/85/9780140144185.jpg", "title_long": "Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.71 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.53}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.71}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "1990-12-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Letters', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["John Steinbeck'], 'title": "Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters", "isbn13": "9780140144185", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1440673314", "ePub": "1440673314"}, "isbn": "0140144188", "isbn10": "0140144188", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781440673313", "binding": "print"}]}}
