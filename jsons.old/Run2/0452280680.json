{"book": {"publisher": "Plume", "synopsis": "A gorilla shrewdly sells back a missing key chain to the highest bidder. An orangutan picks a lock to let himself out of his zoo enclosure and two elephants adopt a tag-team strategy to keep their handlers from putting them back into theirs.<br/><br/>In The Parrot"s Lament, noted environmentalist Eugene Linden offers more than one hundred true anecdotes about animal acts of cooperation, heroism, escapeâ€”even tales of deception or manipulation of human beings. Drawing on the first-person experiences of veterinarians, field biologists, researchers, and trainers, Linden has compiled a warmly entertaining and powerfully persuasive argument for animal consciousness that, while not human, far exceeds what humans usually grant animals.<br/><br/>Scientifically sound and emotionally compelling, The Parrot"s Lament contains remarkable stories that are sure to resonate with animal lovers, turning skeptics everywhere into believers.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/87/9780452280687.jpg", "title_long": "The Parrot"s Lament: And Other True Tales of Animal Intrigue, Intelligence, and Ingenuity", 'dimensions": "Height: 8.01 Inches, Length: 5.37 Inches, Weight: 0.4629707502 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.37}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4629707502}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.01}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2000-08-01", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Fauna'], 'authors": ["Eugene Linden'], 'title": "The Parrot"s Lament: And Other True Tales of Animal Intrigue, Intelligence, and Ingenuity", 'isbn13": "9780452280687", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101222387", "ePub": "1101222387"}, "isbn": "0452280680", "isbn10": "0452280680", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101222386", "binding": "print"}]}}
