{"book": {"publisher": "Univ Of Minnesota Press", "synopsis": "In this classic of critical thought, Deleuze and Guattari challenge conventional interpretations of Kafka’s work. Instead of exploring preexisting categories or literary genres, they propose a concept of “minor literature”—the use of a major language that subverts it from within. Writing as a Jew in Prague, they contend, Kafka made German “take flight on a line of escape” and joyfully became a stranger within it. His work therefore serves as a model for understanding all critical language that must operate within the confines of the dominant language and culture.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/55/9780816615155.jpg", "title_long": "Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature (Volume 30) (Theory and History of Literature)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.875 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.875}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 136, "date_published": "1986-10-31", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Reference'], 'authors": ["Gilles Deleuze'], 'title": "Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature (Volume 30) (Theory and History of Literature)", "isbn13": "9780816615155", "msrp": 20, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0816615152", "isbn10": "0816615152"}}
