{"book": {"publisher": "Lantern Publishing & Media", "synopsis": "From Genesis to Christ, the Bible testifies to God"s love and concern for animals. The same self-centeredness that led to the violence and abuse that has marked human relations also caused the abuse and exploitation of animals. The Bible, argues the author, calls upon human beings to stop their violence and abuse of each other and all other creatures. It promises that when they do, the sorrow and the suffering that marks life on Earth will give way to the joy and peace that God ordained at the creation of the world. In these compelling essays, Rev. J. R. Hyland explores the Old and New Testament and reveals the prophetic voices that called for compassion over killing, and humane concern for all of God"s creation.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/57/9781930051157.jpg", "title_long": "God"s Covenant with Animals: A Biblical Basis for the Humane Treatment of All Creatures", 'edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8.51 Inches, Length: 5.55 Inches, Weight: 0.38 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.55}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.4}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.38}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.51}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2000-06-01", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Catholicism', 'Bible Study & Reference', 'Bible Study', 'Theology', 'Ethics', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Science & Math', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Animal Rights'], 'authors": ["J.
