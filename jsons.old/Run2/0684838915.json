And “Circling the Blanket for God” examines the neurobiological roots underlying religious belief.<br/><br/>Drawing on his career as an evolutionary biologist and neurobiologist, Robert Sapolsky writes about the natural world vividly and insightfully. With candor, humor, and rich observations, these essays marry cutting-edge science with humanity, illuminating the interconnectedness of the world’s inhabitants with skill and flair.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/15/9780684838915.jpg", "title_long": "The Trouble With Testosterone: And Other Essays On The Biology Of The Human Predicament", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.49383546688 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.72}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.49383546688}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4375}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "1998-04-24", "subjects": ["Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Essays & Commentary', 'Evolution', 'Medical Books'], 'authors": ["Robert M.
