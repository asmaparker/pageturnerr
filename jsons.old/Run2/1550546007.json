{"book": {"publisher": "Douglas & McIntyre Ltd", "synopsis": "First published in 1997, this hilarious book launched satirist Will Ferguson\"s career. Challenging the notion that Canadians are “nice,â€ the book asks, “Do we as Canadians deserve a country so great?â€ Tackling subjects from Canada\"s favorite inbred royals to the mighty beaver as national icon, from sex in a canoe to all-Canadian "superhero' Captain Canuck, Ferguson rampages across the cultural landscape. The book also provides a fast-paced, opinionated overview of telling moments in Canadian history, including its run-amok Mounties and “fun-loving daysâ€ of the country\'s (unacknowledged) slave trade.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/02/9781550546002.jpg", "title_long": "Why I Hate Canadians", "edition": "Canadian First", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 220, "date_published": "1997", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology'], 'authors": ["W.
