There are thirteen two-color wood engravings.<br/><br/>'A masterpiece. . . . This is more than stunning fiction: It is a lyric record of a time and a life, shining with Maclean\'s special gift for calling the reader\'s attention to arts of all kinds—the arts that work in nature, in personality, in social intercourse, in fly-fishing.'—Kenneth M. Pierce, Village Voice<br/><br/>'Wise, witty, wonderful, Maclean spins his tales, casts his flies, fishes the rivers and woods for what he remembers of his youth in the Rockies.'—Barbara Bannon, Publishers Weekly<br/><br/>'Maclean\'s book is surely destined to be one of those rare memoirs that can be called a masterpiece. . . . Earthy, whimsical, authoritative, wise; it touches the heart without blushing and traces lasting images for the eye. . . .
