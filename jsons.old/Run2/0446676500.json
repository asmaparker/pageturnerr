Kennedy, Malcolm X, Lyndon B. Johnson, Mahatma Gandhi, and Richard Nixon. It also paints a rich and moving portrait of a people, a time, and a nation in the face of powerful change. Finally, it shows how everyday Americans from all walks of life confronted themselves, each other, and the burden of the past-and how their fears and courage helped shape our future.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/02/9780446676502.jpg", "title_long": "The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.9}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 400, "date_published": "2001-01-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political', 'Religious', 'Social Activists', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": [], "title": "The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.", "isbn13": "9780446676502", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0446676500", "isbn10": "0446676500", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780759520370", "binding": "e"}]}}
