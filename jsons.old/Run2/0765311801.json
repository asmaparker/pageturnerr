{"book": {"publisher": "Tor Books", "synopsis": "For connoisseurs of imaginative fiction, the novels of Jonathan Carroll are a special treat that occupy a space all their own. His surreal fictions, which deftly mix the everyday with the extraordinary, have won him a devoted following. Now, in Glass Soup, Carroll continues to astound . . . .<br/><br/>The realm of the dead is built from the dreams--and nightmares--of the living. Octopuses drive buses. God is a polar bear. And a crowded highway literally leads to hell.<br/><br/>Once before, Vincent Ettrich and his lover, Isabelle Neukor, crossed over from life to death and back again. Now Isabelle bears a very special child, who may someday restore the ever-changing mosaic that is reality. Unless the agents of Chaos can lure her back to the land of the dead--and trap her there forever.<br/><br/>Glass Soup is another exquisite and singular creation from the author January magazine described as "incapable of writing a bad book much less an uninteresting one."", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/01/9780765311801.jpg", "title_long": "Glass Soup", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.71 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.71}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2006-11-28", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Magical Realism'], 'authors": ["Jonathan Carroll'], 'title": "Glass Soup", "isbn13": "9780765311801", "msrp": 22.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0765311801", "isbn10": "0765311801"}}
