{"book": {"publisher": "Addison Wesley", "synopsis": "The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set.<br/>Feynman"s effective classroom style remains intact in these volumes, a valuable work by a remarkable educator. The volumes are an edited version of Richard Feynman"s lectures, taped and transcribed specifically for the books. The three volume commemorative issue is either available hardbound and packaged in a specially designed slipcase, or in a paperbound edition. This three volume work was originally designed for a two-year introductory physics course given at the California Institute of Technology â€” a course designed to take advantage of readers" increasing mathematical prowess and to provide a more comprehensive view of modern-day physics. It is a rigorous undertaking that resulted in a classic reference work for anyone interested in physics.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/46/9780201500646.jpg", "title_long": "The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set", "edition": "2nd", "dimensions": "Height: 11.8 Inches, Length: 9.1 Inches, Weight: 9.74002273516 Pounds, Width: 3.3 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 3.3}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 9.74002273516}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 11.8}}, "pages": 1552, "date_published": "1989-01-01", "subjects": ["Science & Math', 'Physics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ['Richard P.
