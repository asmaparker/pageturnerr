{"book": {"publisher": "Digireads.com", "synopsis": ""The Picture of Dorian Gray" is Oscar Wilde\"s classic tale of the moral decline of its title character, Dorian Gray. When Dorian has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward and wishes that he would stay young while his picture changes, his wish comes true. In exchange for this Dorian gives up his soul and as he ages the bad deeds that he commits are reflected in his painting and not him. 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', arguably Wilde\'s most popular work, was considered quite scandalous when it was first published in the late 1800s in Victorian England.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/89/9781420925289.jpg", "title_long": "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "dimensions": "Height: 9.01573 Inches, Length: 5.98424 Inches, Weight: 0.46076612758 Pounds, Width: 0.2921254 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.98424}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.2921254}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.46076612758}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.01573}}, "pages": 124, "date_published": "2005", "subjects": ["Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Classics', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Oscar Wilde'], 'title": "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "isbn13": "9781420925289", "msrp": 5.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1420925288", "isbn10": "1420925288"}}
