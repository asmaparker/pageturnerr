In persona poems, historical narratives, jazz riffs, sonnets, elegies, and a sequence of ars poetica, American Sublime is Alexander\'s most vivid and varied collection and affirms her place as one of America\'s most lively and gifted writers.<br/><br/>'Alexander is an unusual thing, a sensualist of history, a romanticist of race. She weaves biography, history, experience, pop culture and dream. Her poems make the public and private dance together.' --Chicago Tribune', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/29/9781555974329.jpg", "title_long": "American Sublime: Poems", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.15 Inches, Length: 6.11 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.28 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.11}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.28}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.15}}, "pages": 96, "date_published": "2005-10-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural'], 'authors": ["Elizabeth Alexander'], 'title": "American Sublime: Poems", "isbn13": "9781555974329", "msrp": 14, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1555974325", "isbn10": "1555974325"}}
