{"book": {"publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "synopsis": "Family relationships are at the center of Henry IV, Part 1. King Henry IV and Prince Hal form one major father-son pair, with Henry in despair because Hal lives a dissolute life. The father-son pair of Hotspur (Lord Henry Percy) and his father, the Earl of Northumberland, is in seeming contrast; the king envies Northumberland “his Harry,” wishing he could claim the gallant Hotspur as his own. Meanwhile, Hal has entered into a quasi-father-son relationship with a disreputable but amusing knight, Sir John Falstaff.<br/><br/>Another strand of action centers on still more family relationships. Hotspur’s stand against Henry focuses on Hotspur’s brother-in-law, Mortimer. Mortimer, who fought against the Welsh magician Owen Glendower, was defeated and captured and has married Glendower’s daughter. King Henry pronounces Mortimer a traitor whom he will not ransom. Hotspur, in declaring war on Henry, sees himself as fighting for Mortimer, his wife’s brother.<br/><br/>The authoritative edition of Henry IV, Part 1 from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:<br/><br/>-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play<br/>-Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play<br/>-Scene-by-scene plot summaries<br/>-A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases<br/>-An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language<br/>-An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play<br/>-Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books<br/>-An annotated guide to further reading<br/><br/>Essay by Alexander Leggatt<br/><br/>The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.
