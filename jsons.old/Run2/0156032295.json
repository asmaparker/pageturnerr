{"book": {"publisher": "Mariner Books", "synopsis": "Virginia Woolf is one of the most influential figures in twentieth-century literature. She was original, passionate, vivid, dedicated to her art. Yet most writing about her still revolves around her social life and the Bloomsbury set.<br/><br/>In this fresh, absorbing book, Julia Briggs puts the writing back at the center of Woolf’s life, reads that life through her work, and mines the novels themselves to create a compelling new form of biography. Analyzing Woolf’s own commentary on the creative process through her letters, diaries, and essays, Julia Briggs has produced a book that is a convincing, moving portrait of an artist, as well as a profound meditation on the nature of creativity.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/92/9780156032292.jpg", "title_long": "Virginia Woolf: An Inner Life", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.7 Pounds, Width: 1.36 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.36}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 544, "date_published": "2006-11-06", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Regional U.S.', 'South', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Women Authors', 'British & Irish', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Women's Studies', 'Women Writers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Julia Briggs'], 'title": "Virginia Woolf: An Inner Life", "isbn13": "9780156032292", "msrp": 30.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0156032295", "isbn10": "0156032295"}}
