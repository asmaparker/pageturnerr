{"book": {"publisher": "Ballantine Books", "synopsis": "Life isn’t easy for twenty-two year old Easter and her teenage sister Anneth, who were left parentless as young children. While Easter, a devout Pentecostal, finds solace in the powerful music of her church, Anneth seeks comfort in the rougher edges of life found in dancing, drinking, and fast living. Easter believes in tradition and is intent on rearing her wild young sister properly, but it’s only a matter of time before a wedge is driven between them–and threatens to undo their bond forever. . . .", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/57/9780345480057.jpg", "title_long": "The Coal Tattoo: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 341, "date_published": "2005-08-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Family Life', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Silas House'], 'title": "The Coal Tattoo: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780345480057", "msrp": 10.47, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345480058", "isbn10": "0345480058"}}
