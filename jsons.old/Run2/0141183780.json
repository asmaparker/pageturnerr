{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "In an open cart Elspeth Huxley set off with her parents to travel to Thika in Kenya. As pioneering settlers, they built a house of grass, ate off a damask cloth spread over packing cases, and discovered—the hard way—the world of the African. With an extraordinary gift for detail and a keen sense of humor, Huxley recalls her childhood on the small farm at a time when Europeans waged their fortunes on a land that was as harsh as it was beautiful. For a young girl, it was a time of adventure and freedom, and Huxley paints an unforgettable portrait of growing up among the Masai and Kikuyu people, discovering both the beauty and the terrors of the jungle, and enduring the rugged realities of the pioneer life.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/37/87/9780141183787.jpg", "title_long": "The Flame Trees of Thika: Memories of an African Childhood (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 7.72 inches, Length: 5.09 inches, Weight: 0.54 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.09}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.62}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.54}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.72}}, "pages": 280, "date_published": "2000-02-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Historical', 'Africa', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'History', 'East Africa', 'Kenya', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Elspeth Huxley'], 'title": "The Flame Trees of Thika: Memories of an African Childhood (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)", "isbn13": "9780141183787", "msrp": 18, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101651393"}, "isbn": "0141183780", "isbn10": "0141183780", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101651391", "binding": "print"}]}}
