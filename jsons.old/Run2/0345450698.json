One of the best books I have ever read about contemporary life in the mountains of southern Appalachia. . . . I could see and feel Free Creek, and the mountain above it.”<br/>–LEE SMITH<br/><br/>After his mother is killed, four-year-old Clay Sizemore finds himself alone in a small Appalachian mining town. At first, unsure of Free Creek, he slowly learns to lean on its residents as family. There’s Aunt Easter, who is always filled with a sense of foreboding, bound to her faith above all; quiltmaking Uncle Paul; untamable Evangeline; and Alma, the fiddler whose song wends it way into Clay’s heart. Together, they help Clay fashion a quilt of a life from what treasured pieces surround him. . . .<br/><br/>“A long love poem to the hills of Kentucky. It flows with Appalachian music, religion, and that certain knowledge that your people will always hold you close. . . . Like the finely stitched quilts that Clay’s Uncle Paul labors over, the author sews a flawless seam of folks who love their home and each other.”<br/>–Southern Living<br/><br/>“Unpretentious and clear-eyed . . . A tale whose joys are as legitimate as its sorrows.”<br/>–The Roanoke Times", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/92/9780345450692.jpg", "title_long": "Clay"s Quilt (Ballantine Reader"s Circle)", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.2}}, "pages": 292, "date_published": "2002-02-26", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Family Life', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Silas House'], 'title": "Clay"s Quilt (Ballantine Reader"s Circle)', 'isbn13": "9780345450692", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345450698", "isbn10": "0345450698"}}
