{"book": {"publisher": ""Stewart, Tabori and Chang"", 'synopsis": "The emotional highs and lows, the romantic escapades and the financial setbacks, the moments of comedy, anxiety, and personal tragedy\x97they\x92re all brought vividly to life in Things to Bring, S#!t to Do, the first memoir told entirely in lists. Annotated with Karen\x92s insightful recollections, the book presents a compelling portrait\x97sometimes touching, sometimes hilarious\x97of a woman, her family, and her friends from 1970s America to the present day.<br/><br/>Like many women (and some men, too), Karen Rizzo is a compulsive list-maker. She scribbles grocery lists on Post-It notes, pencils lists of resolutions on the backs of greeting cards, regularly jots down all the things she needs to bring, to do, to remember . .<br/><br/>Unlike the rest of us, however, Karen has saved her lists\x97dating from the list of favorite things she wrote as a kid (Favorite animal: horse; Color: purple; Food: olives from Dad\x92s martini). Together, these scraps of paper form an intimate chronicle of her life\x92s journey, from her early struggles with work and love to the years spent watching her mother battle breast cancer to the times she\x92s had to juggle the demands of marriage and motherhood with those of her career.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/21/9781584795421.jpg", "title_long": "Things to Bring, S#!T to Do... and other inventories of anxiety", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.25}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "2006-10-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor'], 'authors": ["Karen Rizzo'], 'title": "Things to Bring, S#!T to Do... and other inventories of anxiety", "isbn13": "9781584795421", "msrp": 18.95, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1584795425", "isbn10": "1584795425"}}
