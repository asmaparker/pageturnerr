As fiberoptic cable is laid down around the continent, two entities fight to control it. One is UpLink Communications, headed by Roger Gordian. The pan-African fiberoptic ring is his most ambitious—and expensive—endeavor to date. His nemesis, Harlan Devane, is penetrating the network. Trading in black market commodities with terrorists and rogue states, the cable offers him unlimited access to a most valuable product: information. To ensure his success, Devane makes his move halfway around the world. He hits Gordian where it hurts—and kidnaps his daughter. Now, Gordian must trust his UpLink team as never before, as they fight on land and sea to turn the tables against Devane…once and for all.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/50/9780425187050.jpg", "title_long": "Cutting Edge (Tom Clancy"s Power Plays, Book 6)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2002-11-05", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'War', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ["Tom Clancy', 'Jerome Preisler'], 'title": "Cutting Edge (Tom Clancy"s Power Plays, Book 6)", 'isbn13": "9780425187050", "msrp": 7.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101002611", "ePub": "1101002611"}, "isbn": "0425187055", "isbn10": "0425187055", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101002612", "binding": "print"}]}}
