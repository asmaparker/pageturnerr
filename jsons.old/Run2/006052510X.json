{"book": {"publisher": "HarpPeren", "synopsis": "Why would there be a contract out on Edwin de Valu"s life? Edwin -- the wiry low-level editor at Panderic Press. Why has rage disappeared from the roads and McDonald"s gone alfalfa? How come everyone seems so damn happy? And most importantly, who, or what, is Tupak Soiree?<br/>When an enormous self-help manuscript lands on Edwin"s desk, it's headed for the trash. Edwin's cynicism of self-help books, coupled with his filthy mood that morning, results in him dismissing Tupak Soiree's What I Learned on the Mountain and using it as a doorstop. However, Tupak's manuscript is unique -- a self-help book that actually works. Before Edwin knows it, a chain of events begins that affects not only his own life but the world at large.<br/>For those who choke on Chicken Soup for the Soul or have choice words for Dr. Phil, Will Ferguson offers up a killer dose of Happinessâ„¢ -- a masterpiece of comic fiction.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/51/01/9780060525101.jpg", "title_long": "Happiness", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 309, "date_published": "2003-06-03", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous'], 'authors": ["Will Ferguson'], 'title": "Happiness", "isbn13": "9780060525101", "msrp": 12.07, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "006052510X", "isbn10": "006052510X"}}
