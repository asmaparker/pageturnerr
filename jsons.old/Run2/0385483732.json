{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "As a young girl in a working-class neighborhood of Sydney, Australia, Geraldine Brooks longed to discover the places where history happens and culture comes from, so she enlisted pen pals who offered her a window on adolescence in the Middle East, Europe, and America. Twenty years later Brooks, an award-winning foreign correspondent, embarked on a human treasure hunt to find her pen friends. She found men and women whose lives had been shaped by war and hatred, by fame and notoriety, and by the ravages of mental illness. Intimate, moving, and often humorous, Foreign Correspondence speaks to the unquiet heart of every girl who has ever yearned to become a woman of the world.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/35/9780385483735.jpg", "title_long": "Foreign Correspondence: A Pen Pal"s Journey from Down Under to All Over", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.43651527876 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.24}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.53}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.43651527876}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.98}}, "pages": 217, "date_published": "1999-01-19", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Africa', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Business', 'Journalists', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Travel', 'Caribbean', 'Cuba', 'Specialty Travel', 'Adventure', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Communication & Media Studies', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Geraldine Brooks'], 'title": "Foreign Correspondence: A Pen Pal"s Journey from Down Under to All Over", 'isbn13": "9780385483735", "msrp": 12.98, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307773647"}, "isbn": "0385483732", "isbn10": "0385483732", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307773647", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
