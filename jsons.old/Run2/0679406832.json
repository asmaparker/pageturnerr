It tells of light and life and love and the security that lies at the heart." —New York Times Book Review<br/><br/>Drawing inspiration from the the shells on the shore, Lindbergh\"s musings on the shape of a woman\'s life will bring new understanding to readers, male and family, at any stage of life. A mother of five and professional writer, she casts an unsentimental eye at the trappings of modern life that threaten to overwhelm us—the timesaving gadgets that complicate our lives, the overcommitments that take us from our families.<br/><br/>With great wisdom and insight she describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of a life lived in enduring and evolving partnership.
