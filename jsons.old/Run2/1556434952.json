{"book": {"publisher": "North Atlantic Books", "synopsis": "Product Description      Written by fictional character "Xavier de C***" as a plea to an American president, Empire 2.0 is a scorching satire of totalitarianism. In it, the hero, a Frenchman, renounces his citizenship to become an American. This breezy book argues that resistance to America\"s overwhelming power is futile and that to survive, Europe must allow itself to be annexed by the U.S. Debray\'s insights into the growing European resentment of American unilateralism could not be more timely.      Review      'In post-September 11 literature, [Debray\'s book] takes pride of place.'- Vianney Delourme, Parutions.com'Debray denounces, through the character he creates, all those passive pro-Americans who refuse to follow their choice to the end. Those who don\'t understand that the logic and coherence of their behavior would have to conduct them to become proud citizens of the United States and militant soldiers of the Pax Americana.'- Jean Daniel, Le nouvel observateur'Those inquisitors, for whom Debray is the \'convenient Anti-American,\' will discover here that he is capable of \'thinking the Other,\' of developing with convincing forcre the arguments of a philo-American of heart and reason.'- Max Gallo, Le Point       About the Author      Regis Debray graduated from the prestigious Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris in 1940. He later obtained his PhD in philosophy. His early career was that of a journalist-adventurer. A leftist hereo of the 1960s, his writings attracted the interest of Che Guevara, and he was invited to Cuba by Fidel Castro himself. For the last decade or more, Debray has become known as the leading 'mediologist,' and an advocate of overcoming the ideological dualism of Right vs. Left.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/52/9781556434952.jpg", "title_long": "Empire 2.0: A Modest Proposal for a United States of the West by Xavier de C*** (The Terra Nova Series)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.9 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.9}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7}}, "pages": 144, "date_published": "2004-05-04", "subjects": ["Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ["Xavier De C.'], 'title": "Empire 2.0: A Modest Proposal for a United States of the West by Xavier de C*** (The Terra Nova Series)", "isbn13": "9781556434952", "msrp": 11.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1556434952", "isbn10": "1556434952"}}
