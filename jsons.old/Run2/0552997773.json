It is so beautifully written and the construction of the narrative is masterful"<br/>Emma Newman, author of Planetfall<br/>THE ACCLAIMED GENRE-DEFINING WINNER OF THE 1998 ARTHUR C. CLARKE AWARD<br/>Set in the 21st century - a number of decades from now - The Sparrow is the story of a charismatic Jesuit priest and talented linguist, Emilio Sandoz, who - in response to a remarkable radio signal from the depths of space - leads a scientific mission to make first contact with an extra-terrestrial culture.<br/>In the true tradition of Jesuit adventurers before him, Sandoz and his companions are prepared to endure isolation, suffering - even death - but nothing can prepare them for the civilisation they encounter. Or for the tragic misunderstanding that brings the mission to a devastating end. Once considered a living saint, Sandoz returns alone to Earth horrifically maimed, both physically and spiritually, the mission"s sole survivor - only to be blamed for the mission's failure and accused of heinous crimes.<br/>Written in clean, effortless prose and peopled with memorable characters who never lose their humanity or humour, The Sparrow is a powerful, haunting fiction - a tragic but ultimately triumphant novel about the nature of faith, of love and what it means to be 'human' and widely considered to be a classic of the genre.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/75/9780552997775.jpg", "title_long": "Sparrow", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 4.99999 Inches, Weight: 0.76279942652 Pounds, Width: 1.25984 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.99999}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25984}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.76279942652}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.79526}}, "pages": 512, "date_published": "2006-09-01", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Literary', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Adventure'], 'authors": ["Mary Doria Russell'], 'title": "Sparrow", "isbn13": "9780552997775", "msrp": 16.5, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0552997773", "isbn10": "0552997773"}}
