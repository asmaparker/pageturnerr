{"book": {"publisher": "Chronicle Books", "synopsis": "<p>One of the very first <i>Star Wars</i> posters had no images at all just enormous block letters that announced, "Coming to Your Galaxy This Summer: <i>Star Wars</i>." The rest is history. Now, 28 years later, the 350 most amazing <i>Star Wars</i> movie posters are collected for the first time. This compilation spans the surreal to ultra realistic, the campy to darkly serious: Darth Vader\"s head exploding in a shower of camera parts; Anakin Skywalker casting an ominous Sith shadow; C-3PO and R2-D2 selling <i>Star Wars</i> shoes; Luke and Vader in mortal battle aboard the Death Star. Classic posters are joined with text by the world\'s foremost <i>Star Wars</i> collector, Stephen Sansweet, and poster collector Peter Vilmur, behind-the-scenes stories from artists and designers, a scarcity guide to over 2,000 posters, and a bootleg identification guide. Exploding with color, <i>The Star Wars Poster Book</i> illuminates an unexplored corner of <i>Star Wars</i> history. </p><br/><p> 2005 by Lucasfilm Ltd. &amp; TM.
