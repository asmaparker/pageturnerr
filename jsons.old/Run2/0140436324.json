{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "In his reflections on Christianity, Saint Thomas Aquinas forged a unique synthesis of ancient philosophy and medieval theology. Preoccupied with the relationship between faith and reason, he was influenced both by Aristotle"s rational world view and by the powerful belief that wisdom and truth can ultimately only be reached through divine revelation. Thomas"s writings, which contain highly influential statements of fundamental Christian doctrine, as well as observations on topics as diverse as political science, anti-Semitism and heresy, demonstrate the great range of his intellect and place him firmly among the greatest medieval philosophers.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
