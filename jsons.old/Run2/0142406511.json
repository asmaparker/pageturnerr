When her small hometown in Arkansas becomes the site of a camp housing German prisoners during World War II, Patty learns what it means to open her heart. Even though she\"s Jewish, she begins to see a prison escapee, Anton, not as a Nazi, but as a lonely, frightened young man with feelings not unlike her own.<br/><br/>In Anton, Patty finds someone who softens the pain of her own father\"s rejection and who appreciates her in a way her mother never will. While patriotic feelings run high, Patty risks losing family, friends — even her freedom — for this dangerous friendship. It is a risk she has to take and one she will have to pay a price to keep.<br/><br/>"An exceptionally fine novel.' —The New York Times<br/><br/>'Courageous and compelling!' —Publishers Weekly<br/><br/>A National Book Award Finalist<br/>An ALA Notable Book<br/>A New York Times Outstanding Book of the Year', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/65/19/9780142406519.jpg", "title_long": "Summer of My German Soldier (Puffin Modern Classics)", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.06 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.41226442994 Pounds, Width: 0.63 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.63}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.41226442994}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.06}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2006-04-20", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Religious Fiction', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ['Bette Greene'], 'title": "Summer of My German Soldier (Puffin Modern Classics)", "isbn13": "9780142406519", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0142406511", "isbn10": "0142406511"}}
