{"book": {"publisher": "Oxford University Press", "synopsis": "In her first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen presents us with the subtle portraits of two contrasting but equally compelling heroines. For sensible Elinor Dashwood and her impetuous younger sister Marianne the prospect of marrying the men they love appears remote. In a world ruled by money and self-interest, the Dashwood sisters have neither fortune nor connections. Concerned for others and for social proprieties, Elinor is ill-equipped to compete with self-centered fortune-hunters like Lucy Steele, while Marianne"s unswerving belief in the truth of her own feelings makes her more dangerously susceptible to the designs of unscrupulous men.<br/>Through her heroines" parallel experiences of love, loss, and hope, Jane Austen offers a powerful analysis of the ways in which women"s lives were shaped by the claustrophobic society in which they had to survive.
