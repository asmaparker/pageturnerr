And it is a worthy calling. But developing these qualities isn"t a matter of working harder or working smarter. Rather, it"s a matter of knowing God more deeply--discovering how he wants to work in and through you. These devotions are drawn from Bill Hybels"s writings and sermons such as Making Life Work, Finding God in the Storms of Life, Too Busy Not to Pray and Who You Are When No One's Looking.
