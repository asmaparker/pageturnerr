Unfortunately the memories have been transformed into immensely powerful magical feathers, and those who possess them are seldom willing to give them up without a fight. The quest takes Syaoran’s odd bunch to a jungle world where helpless creatures are being terrorized by a sacrifice-demanding beast. When Syaoran, Mokona, and Sakura are separated from Fai and Kurogane, each group finds themselves on opposing sides of a conflict that threatens to destroy the future of a troupe of young women performers . . . and possibly the entire world!", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/84/9780345484284.jpg", "title_long": "Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 8", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2006-01-31", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors": ["Clamp'], 'title": "Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 8", "isbn13": "9780345484284", "msrp": 10.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345484282", "isbn10": "0345484282"}}
