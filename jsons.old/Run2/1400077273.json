{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "A brilliant, painful, dazzling, and funny as hell novel about a family man who is attacked in a garden and suddenly becomes an anti-husband and anti-father, from "one of the greatest novelists of his generation" (TIME)<br/><br/>“Amis is a stone-solid genius...a dazzling star of wit and insight.” —The Wall Street Journal<br/><br/>When “dream husband” Xan Meo is vengefully assaulted in the garden of a London pub, he suffers head injury, and personality change. He submits to an alien moral system—one among many to be found in these pages. We are introduced to the inverted worlds of the “yellow” journalist, Clint Smoker; the high priest of hardmen, Joseph Andrews; and the porno tycoon, Cora Susan.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we explore the entanglements of Henry England: his incapacitated wife, Pamela; his Chinese mistress, He Zhezun; his fifteen-year-old daughter, Victoria, the victim of a filmed “intrusion” that rivets the world—because she is the future Queen of England, and her father, Henry IX, is its King. The connections between these characters provide the pattern and drive of Yellow Dog.<br/><br/>If, in the 21st century, the moral reality is changing, then the novel is changing too, whether it likes it or not. Yellow Dog is a model of how the novel, or more particularly the comic novel, can respond to this transformation.<br/><br/>But Martin Amis is also concerned here with what is changeless and perhaps unchangeable. Patriarchy, and the entire edifice of masculinity; the enormous category-error of violence, arising between man and man; the tortuous alliances between men and women; and the vanished dream (probably always an illusion, but now a clear delusion) that we can protect our future and our progeny.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/74/9781400077274.jpg", "title_long": "Yellow Dog", "edition": "Vintage Intl", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2005-01-04", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Martin Amis'], 'title": "Yellow Dog", "isbn13": "9781400077274", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101910275"}, "isbn": "1400077273", "isbn10": "1400077273", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101910276", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
