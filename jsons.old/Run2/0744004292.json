The game features several new elements and revolves around three cities--Los Santos (based on Los Angeles), San Fierro (based on San Francisco), and Las Venturas (based on Las Vegas). Each city is relatively the size of Vice City--making it clear what the magnitude of the game is. Some of the new elements in this game include four-person drivebys, house break-ins and robberies, character abilities such as eating and swimming and more. The visual effects have also been improved with things like real-time reflections, fully rendered interior environments, and new camera controls. The storyline, set in the early 90s, centers on Carl Johnson, a man who escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas, five years ago. Now Carl"s got to go home, and on his return to the neighborhood, he is framed for homicide.
