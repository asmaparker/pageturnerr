{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "A majestic fictional evocation of the Norse arrival in the New World, from the National Book Award-winning author of Europe Central<br/><br/>The time is the tenth century A.D. The newcomers are a proud and bloody-minded people whose kings once changed themselves into wolves. The Norse have advanced as implacably as a glacier from Iceland to the wastes of Greenland and from there to the place they call "Vinland the Good." The natives are a bronze-skinned race who have not yet discovered iron and still see themselves as part of nature.<br/>As William T. Vollmann tells the converging stories of these two peoples--and of the Norsewomen Freydis and Gudrid, whose venomous rivalry brings frost into paradise--he creates a tour-de-force of speculative history, a vivid amalgam of Icelandic saga, Inuit creation myth, and contemporary travel writing that yields a new an utterly original vision of our continent and its past.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/19/63/9780140131963.jpg", "title_long": "The Ice-Shirt: Volume One of Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes", "edition": "6th Printing", "dimensions": "Height: 8.39 Inches, Length: 5.55 Inches, Weight: 1.11 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.55}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.13}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.11}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.39}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "1993-08-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Native American', 'Literary', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["William T.
