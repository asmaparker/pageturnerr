{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "In his writing, Borges always combined high seriousness with a wicked sense of fun. Here he reveals his delight in re-creating (or making up) colorful stories from the Orient, the Islamic world, and the Wild West, as well as his horrified fascination with knife fights, political and personal betrayal, and bloodthirsty revenge. Sparkling with the sheer exuberant pleasure of story-telling, this collection marked the emergence of an utterly distinctive literary voice.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/96/9780142437896.jpg", "title_long": "A Universal History of Iniquity (Penguin Classics)", "dimensions": "Height: 7.8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.33 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.33}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.2}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.8}}, "pages": 128, "date_published": "2004-07-27", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Jorge Luis Borges'], 'title": "A Universal History of Iniquity (Penguin Classics)", "isbn13": "9780142437896", "msrp": 12, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0142437891", "isbn10": "0142437891"}}
