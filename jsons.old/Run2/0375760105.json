Born in Newgate Prison to a picaresque mother, Moll propels herself through marriages, periods of success and destitution, and a trip to the New World and back, only to return to the place of her birth as a popular prostitute and brilliant thief. The story of Moll Flanders vividly illustrates Defoe’s themes of social mobility and predestination, sin, redemption and reward.<br/><br/>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the 1721 edition printed by Chetwood in London, the only edition approved by Defoe.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/05/9780375760105.jpg", "title_long": "Moll Flanders (Modern Library Classics)", "edition": "Modern Library", "dimensions": "Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.67461452172 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.77}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.67461452172}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.96}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2002-06-11", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Women's Adventure', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Daniel Defoe'], 'title": "Moll Flanders (Modern Library Classics)", "isbn13": "9780375760105", "msrp": 14, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375760105", "isbn10": "0375760105", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780553903133", "binding": "print"}, {"isbn": "9780679640028", "binding": "print"}]}}
