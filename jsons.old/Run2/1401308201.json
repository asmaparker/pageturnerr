Every week, 15,000 people pack New York\"s Gershwin Theatre to see the show. Wicked is based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire. It tells the story of Elphaba, the headstrong Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda, the good witch, growing up in the Land of Oz. This beautifully packaged, whimsical keepsake is designed to resemble the Grimmerie, an ancient book of spells that Elphaba uses in the show. Wicked: The Grimmerie offers fans a behind-the-curtains peek at the musical, profiles of the cast and creative team, and inside stories, with full-color photographs throughout. Some of the irresistible special features include an "Ozian" glossary, spells, an illustrated family tree, and a step-by-step look at how Elphaba gets green before each show--everything fans need to relive the Broadway experience day after day.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/09/9781401308209.jpg", "title_long": "Wicked: The Grimmerie, a Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 12.3 Inches, Length: 9.35 Inches, Weight: 3.1746565728 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.35}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 3.1746565728}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 12.3}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2005-10-26", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Music', 'Musical Genres'], 'authors": ["David Cote'], 'title": "Wicked: The Grimmerie, a Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical", "isbn13": "9781401308209", "msrp": 31.24, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1401308201", "isbn10": "1401308201"}}
