{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "A new edition of the Fantasy Tales that inspired J.R.R. Tolkien and H.P. Lovecraft<br/><br/>A pioneer in the realm of imaginative literature, Lord Dunsany has gained a cult following for his influence on modern fantasy literature, including such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft. This unique collection of short stories ranges over five decades of work. Liberal selections of earlier tales—including the entire Gods of Pegana as well as such notable works as "Idle Days of the Yann" and "The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth'—are followed by memorable later tales, including several about the garrulous traveler Joseph Jorkens and the outrageous murder tale 'The Two Bottles of Relish.' Throughout, the stories are united by Dunsany\'s cosmic vision, his impeccable and mellifluous prose, and his distinctively Irish sense of whimsy.<br/><br/>Here published for the first time by Penguin Classics, this edition is the only annotated version of Dunsany\'s short stories.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/66/9780142437766.jpg", "title_long": "In the Land of Time: And Other Fantasy Tales (Penguin Classics)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.72 Inches, Length: 5.04 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.04}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.94}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.72}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2004-02-24", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Sword & Sorcery'], 'authors": ["Lord Dunsany'], 'title": "In the Land of Time: And Other Fantasy Tales (Penguin Classics)", "isbn13": "9780142437766", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "014243776X", "isbn10": "014243776X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781440650260", "binding": "print"}]}}
