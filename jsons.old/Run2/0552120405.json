{"book": {"publisher": "Corgi Books", "synopsis": "“The first of my father’s illusions was that bears could survive the life lived by human beings, and the second was that human beings could survive a life led in hotels.” So says John Berry, son of a hapless dreamer, brother to a cadre of eccentric siblings, and chronicler of the lives lived, the loves experienced, the deaths met, and the myriad strange and wonderful times encountered by the family Berry. Hoteliers, pet-bear owners, friends of Freud (the animal trainer and vaudevillian, that is), and playthings of mad fate, they “dream on” in a funny, sad, outrageous, and moving novel by the remarkable author of A Prayer for Owen Meany and Last Night in Twisted River.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/01/9780552120401.jpg", "title_long": "The Hotel New Hampshire (Export Ed)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Weight: 0.45415225972 Pounds", "dimensions_structured": {'weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.45415225972}}, "pages": 427, "date_published": "1982", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors": ['John Irving'], 'title": "The Hotel New Hampshire (Export Ed)", "isbn13": "9780552120401", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0552120405", "isbn10": "0552120405"}}
