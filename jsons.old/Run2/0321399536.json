{"book": {"publisher": "Pearson", "synopsis": "From the Longman Cultural Editions series, this second edition of Frankenstein presents Mary Shelley\"s remarkable novel in several provocative and illuminating contexts: cultural, critical, and literary.<br/><br/>Series Editor Susan J. Wolfson presents the 1818 version of Mary Shelley\"s famous novel in its cultural and historical contexts. Like all great works of fiction, Frankenstein gains depth and dimension from its "conversation' with contemporary texts, especially those by Shelley\'s own parents, husband, and friends. A lively introduction is complemented by a chronology coordinating Shelley\'s life with key historical events and a speculative calendar of the novel\'s events in the late eighteenth century. In addition to the 1818 text, this cultural edition features the introduction to and a sample revision of the 1831 version. New to this Edition is Frankentalk, a section of selected references to Frankenstein in the popular press, and the complete text of Richard Brinsley Peake’s Frankenstein, A Romantic Drama, the first stage version of Frankenstein.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/33/9780321399533.jpg", "title_long": "Frankenstein", "edition": "2nd", "dimensions": "Height: 8.1 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 1.12876678144 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.12876678144}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.1}}, "pages": 464, "date_published": "2006-06-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Movements & Periods', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Mary Shelley'], 'title": "Frankenstein", "isbn13": "9780321399533", "msrp": 28.4, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0321399536", "isbn10": "0321399536"}}
