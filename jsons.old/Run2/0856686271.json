{"book": {"publisher": "Liverpool University Press", "synopsis": "Books VIII &IX are crucial to the structure of the Iliad, and, while both of them have been extensively discussed in the Unitarian/Analyst debate, neither has perhaps received the attention that their fine literary qualities deserve. In VIII, Zeus finally begins to fulfil the promise he has made to Thetis in Book I to give victory to the Trojans until Agamemnon compensates her son Achilles for the dishonour he has done him. The scenes of fighting are repeatedly interrupted by scenes of divine action. In IX, Agamemnon offers compensation, which however Achilles, who now appears for the first time since his withdrawal in I, refuses. This book is the one in which Homer revealed himself as the originator of tragedy. In this edition, Homeric grammatical forms will be explained as they occur at the foot of the page. These explanations are linked to a section of the Introduction on Homeric grammar. A new edition of books VIII and IX with an introduction, text with facing translation, and commentary.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/76/9780856686276.jpg", "title_long": "Homer: Iliad VIII and IX (Aris and Phillips Classical Texts)", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 6 Inches, Length: 8.4 Inches, Weight: 0 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "1996-01-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literary', 'Ancient & Medieval Literature', 'Ancient & Classical', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference'], 'authors": ["C.
