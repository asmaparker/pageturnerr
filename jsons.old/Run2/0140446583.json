{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "Summoned to the country estate of his wealthy uncle Colonel Yegor Rostanev, the young student Sergey Aleksandrovich finds himself thrown into a startling bedlam. For as he soon sees, his meek and kind-hearted uncle is wholly dominated by a pretentious and despotic pseudo-intellectual named Opiskin, a charlatan who has ingratiated himself with Yegor’s mother and now holds the entire household under his thumb. Watching the absurd theatrics of this domestic tyrant over forty-eight explosive hours, Sergey grows increasingly furious - until at last, he feels compelled to act. A compelling comic exploration of petty tyranny, The Village of Stepanchikovo reveals a delight in life’s wild absurdities that rivals even Gogol’s. It also offers a fascinating insight into the genesis of the characters and situations of many of Dostoyevsky’s great later novels, including The Idiot, Devils and The Brothers Karamazov.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/65/86/9780140446586.jpg", "title_long": "The Village of Stepanchikovo: And its Inhabitants: From the Notes of an Unknown (Penguin Classics)", "edition": "Subsequent", "dimensions": "Height: 0.58 Inches, Length: 7.8 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 5.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.8}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.440924524}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.58}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "1995-12-01", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Regional & Cultural', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Fyodor Dostoyevsky'], 'title": "The Village of Stepanchikovo: And its Inhabitants: From the Notes of an Unknown (Penguin Classics)", "isbn13": "9780140446586", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0140446583", "isbn10": "0140446583"}}
