For Danny, a Yale junior, it means two weeks behind the wheel of the Roach Coach, his father"s lunch truck, which plies the parking lots of office parks in central New Jersey.<br/><br/>But Danny can use the time behind the coffee urn to try and make sense of a love life that's gotten a little complicated. There's loyal and patient hometown honey Cindy and her recently dropped bombshell to contend with. And there's also lissome Polly back in New Haven--with her shifting moods, perfect thrift store dresses and inconvenient liaison with a dashing professor.<br/><br/>If girl problems aren't enough, there's the constant menace of the Lunch Monsters, a group of thugs who think Danny has planted the Roach Coach in their territory.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/85/9780312361785.jpg", "title_long": "Joe College: A Novel", "edition": "2nd", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.72}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2006-09-19", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Tom Perrotta'], 'title": "Joe College: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780312361785", "msrp": 14.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312361785", "isbn10": "0312361785", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781429907804", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
