{"book": {"publisher": "Copernicus", "synopsis": "Leaps of Faith is a compelling and highly praised critique of beliefs in paranormal phenomena, miracles, and the like, written by the noted British psychologist Nicholas Humphrey. The author argues that our beliefs in the supernatural typically originate in anxiety about the future and are sustained by an entrenched belief in the duality of mind and body. More than just a debunking of supernaturalism, Leaps of Faith explores the psychology of the all-too-human tendency for wishful thinking. It explains why we hark after a fantasy world of magic and miracles - even when, arguably, we already live in the only world that offers real hope of fulfillment.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/00/9780387987200.jpg", "title_long": "Leaps of Faith: Science, Miracles, and the Search for Supernatural Consolation", "edition": "1999", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.873929227 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.59}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.873929227}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 256, "date_published": "1999-06-04", "subjects": ["Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Occult & Paranormal', 'Parapsychology', 'Science & Math', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine'], 'authors": ["Nicholas Humphrey'], 'title": "Leaps of Faith: Science, Miracles, and the Search for Supernatural Consolation", "isbn13": "9780387987200", "msrp": 27.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0387987207", "isbn10": "0387987207"}}
