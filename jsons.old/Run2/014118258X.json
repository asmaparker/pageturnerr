{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books, Limited (UK)", "synopsis": "Dorothy Parker, more than any of her contemporaries, captured the spirit of her age in her writing. The decadent 1920S and 1930s in New York were a time of great experiment and daring for women. For the rich, life seemed a continual party, but the excesses took their emotional toll. With a biting wit and perceptive insight, Dorothy Parker examines the social mores of her day and exposes the darkness beneath the dazzle. Her own life exemplified this duality, for a while she was one of the most talked-about women of her day, she was also known as a "masochist whose passion for unhappiness knew no bounds". As philosopher Irwin Edman said, she was "a Sappho who could combine a heartbreak with a wisecrack'. Her dissection of the jazz age in poetry and prose is collected in this volume along with articles and reviews.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/25/82/9780141182582.jpg", "title_long": "The Collected Dorothy Parker", "edition": "New", "dimensions": "Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.96121546232 Pounds, Width: 1.06299 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.07873}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.06299}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.96121546232}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.79526}}, "pages": 640, "date_published": "2007", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories'], 'authors": ['Dorothy Parker'], 'title": "The Collected Dorothy Parker", "isbn13": "9780141182582", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "014118258X", "isbn10": "014118258X"}}
