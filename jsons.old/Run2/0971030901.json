{"book": {"publisher": "Keep It Simple Books", "synopsis": "This book reveals the origin of self-hate, how self-hate works, how to identify it, and how to go beyond it. It provides examples of some of the forms self-hate takes, including taking blame but not credit, holding grudges, and trying to be perfect, and explores the many facets of self-hate, including its role in addiction, the battering cycle, and the illusion of control. After addressing these factors, it illustrates how a meditation practice can be developed and practiced in efforts to free oneself from self-hating beliefs.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/09/9780971030909.jpg", "title_long": "There Is Nothing Wrong with You: Going Beyond Self-Hate", "edition": "Revised edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.75}}, "pages": 264, "date_published": "2001-10-01", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Happiness', 'Self-Esteem', 'Spiritual', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["Cheri Huber'], 'title": "There Is Nothing Wrong with You: Going Beyond Self-Hate", "isbn13": "9780971030909", "msrp": 12, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0971030901", "isbn10": "0971030901", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781733707091", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
