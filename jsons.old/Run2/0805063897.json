{"book": {"publisher": "Holt Paperbacks", "synopsis": "The New York Times bestseller, and one of the most talked about books of the year, Nickel and Dimed has already become a classic of undercover reportage.<br/><br/>Millions of Americans work for poverty-level wages, and one day Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that any job equals a better life. But how can anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 to $7 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich moved from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, taking the cheapest lodgings available and accepting work as a waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing-home aide, and Wal-Mart salesperson. She soon discovered that even the "lowliest" occupations require exhausting mental and physical efforts. And one job is not enough; you need at least two if you intend to live indoors.<br/><br/>Nickel and Dimed reveals low-wage America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity -- a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate strategies for survival. Instantly acclaimed for its insight, humor, and passion, this book is changing the way America perceives its working poor.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/99/9780805063899.jpg", "title_long": "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2002-05-01", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic Conditions', 'Labor & Industrial Relations', 'Human Resources', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Poverty'], 'authors": ['Barbara Ehrenreich'], 'title": "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America", "isbn13": "9780805063899", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0805063897", "isbn10": "0805063897"}}
