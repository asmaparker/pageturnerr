On another level it’s the story of a disaffected, middle-aged black journalist on a mission to set a record for junketeering who attends the annual John Henry Days festival. It is also a high-velocity thrill ride through the tunnel where American legend gives way to American pop culture, replete with p. r. flacks, stamp collectors, blues men , and turn-of-the-century song pluggers.<br/><br/>John Henry Days is an acrobatic, intellectually dazzling, and laugh-out-loud funny book that will be read and talked about for years to come.<br/><br/>Look for Colson Whitehead’s new novel, Crook Manifesto!", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/03/9780385498203.jpg", "title_long": "John Henry Days", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.99 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.16}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.83}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.66}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.99}}, "pages": 385, "date_published": "2002-05-14", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'War & Military', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Colson Whitehead'], 'title": "John Henry Days", "isbn13": "9780385498203", "msrp": 11.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307486672"}, "isbn": "0385498209", "isbn10": "0385498209", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307486677", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
