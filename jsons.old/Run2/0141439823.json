{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Classics", "synopsis": "The original tale of a castaway struggling to survive on a remote desert island, and one of the first novels in English<br/><br/>The sole survivor of a shipwreck, Robinson Crusoe is washed up on a desert island. In his journal he chronicles his daily battle to stay alive, as he conquers isolation, fashions shelter and clothes, enlists the help of a native islander who he names "Friday", and fights off cannibals and mutineers. Written in an age of exploration and enterprise, it has been variously interpreted as an embodiment of British imperialist values, as a portrayal of "natural man', or as a moral fable. But above all is a brilliant narrative, depicting Crusoe's transformation from terrified survivor to self-sufficient master of an island. This edition contains a full chronology of Defoe's life and times, explanatory notes, glossary and a critical introduction discussing Robinson Crusoe as a pioneering work of modern psychological realism.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
