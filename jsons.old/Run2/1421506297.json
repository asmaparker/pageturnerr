But all that changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami death god. Any human whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer. With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble goal...or his life?<br/><br/>Light--working as Kira, the newest member of the NPA intelligence bureau, and L--has nearly succeeded in creating his ideal world. But the years of uncontested victory have made him complacent, and he is unprepared for a new attack close to home. With his younger sister Sayu kidnapped and the NPA"s Death Note demanded as ransom, Light must travel across the world and confront two new adversaries, each with a very different agenda. Will Light"s quick wits be a match for this new challenge, or will he be forced to choose between Kira's ambitions and his own family's lives?', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/96/9781421506296.jpg", "title_long": "Death Note, Vol. 8", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.40124131684 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.40124131684}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2006-11-07", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Media Tie-In', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery, Thriller & Crime', 'Shonen', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ["Tsugumi Ohba'], 'title": "Death Note, Vol. 8", "isbn13": "9781421506296", "msrp": 7.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1421506297", "isbn10": "1421506297"}}
