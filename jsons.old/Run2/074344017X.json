{"book": {"publisher": "Pocket Books", "synopsis": "Predators by nature, the Prowlers are all around us. Savage killers on the inside, on the outside, most of the time, they look just like us. Wild Things is the fourth climactic volume in Christopher Golden"s series of supernatural thrillers. A series of mysterious deaths leads Jack Dwyer and Molly Hatcher to the fastlanes, rest stops, and all-night diners of a highway in upstate New York. Meanwhile, their friend Bill Cantwell heads to Manhattan in search of his missing niece, who disappeared months ago when trying to build a career in New York"s fickle music scene. Back in Boston, Jack"s sister, Courtney, is left alone to hold the fort. But Jasmine, a deadly and vengeful enemy, is growing in strength. She barely survived her run-in with them in Boston but has now begun to collect a new pack of fellow predators in New York. When Bill probes the Prowler underground, he finds old friends, secret alliances, and betrayal. His predicament draws Courtney away from safety to try and protect the man she loves. To the north, Jack and Molly uncover the frightening truth -- that with Jasmine to lead them the Prowler pack has grown larger than they could ever have anticipated. With Prowlers all around them they must reach out to all of their allies, dead or alive, if they are to save Bill and Courtney and survive the final cataclysmic confrontation with the killers on their trail.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/72/9780743440172.jpg", "title_long": "Wild Things", "pages": 320, "date_published": "2003", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors": ['Christopher Golden'], 'title": "Wild Things", "isbn13": "9780743440172", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "074344017X", "isbn10": "074344017X"}}
