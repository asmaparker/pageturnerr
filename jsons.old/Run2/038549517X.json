{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "At once a pioneering study of evolution and an accessible and lively reading experience, a book that offers the most convincing—and radical—explanation for how and why the human mind evolved.<br/><br/>Consciousness, morality, creativity, language, and art: these are the traits that make us human. Scientists have traditionally explained these qualities as merely a side effect of surplus brain size, but Miller argues that they were sexual attractors, not side effects. He bases his argument on Darwin’ s theory of sexual selection, which until now has played second fiddle to Darwin’ s theory of natural selection, and draws on ideas and research from a wide range of fields, including psychology, economics, history, and pop culture. Witty, powerfully argued, and continually thought-provoking, The Mating Mind is a landmark in our understanding of our own species.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/72/9780385495172.jpg", "title_long": "The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.92 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.12}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.92}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 528, "date_published": "2001-04-17", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Sexuality', 'Evolutionary Psychology', 'History', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'Evolution', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Cognitive', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Marriage & Family'], 'authors": ["Geoffrey Miller'], 'title": "The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature", "isbn13": "9780385495172", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307813746"}, "isbn": "038549517X", "isbn10": "038549517X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307813749", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
