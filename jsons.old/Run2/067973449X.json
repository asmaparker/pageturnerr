Wodehouse\"s house parties, the chaos might resemble the nightmarishly funny goings-on in this novel from "one of the most gifted novelists of his generation” (TIME).<br/><br/>“Amis is a born comic novelist in the tradition that ranges from Dickens to Waugh.... [His] mercurial style…can rise to Joycean brilliance” —Newsweek<br/><br/>"Amis\'s version of the bleak and wrecky future that awaits a sex-and-drug-addicted society is...fizzing with style, [and] busy with verbal inventiveness.' —Julian Barnes, best-selling author of The Sense of an Ending<br/><br/>The residents of Appleseed Rectory have primed themselves both for a visit from a triad of Americans and a weekend of copious drug taking and sexual gymnastics. There\'s even a heifer to be slugged and a pair of doddering tenants to be ingeniously harassed. But none of these variously bright and dull young things has counted on the intrusion of 'dead babies'—dreary spasms of reality. Or on the uninvited presence of a mysterious prankster named Johnny, whose sinister idea of fun makes theirs look like a game of backgammon.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/99/9780679734499.jpg", "title_long": "Dead Babies", "edition": "First American Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.4125 Pounds, Width: 0.5 inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.16}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4125}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.9}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "1991-04-03", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Martin Amis'], 'title": "Dead Babies", "isbn13": "9780679734499", "msrp": 11.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "067973449X", "isbn10": "067973449X"}}
