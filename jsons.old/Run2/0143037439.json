Boyle that explore humanity’s wild side<br/><br/>Since his first collection of stories, Descent of Man, appeared in 1979, T.C. Boyle has become an acknowledged master of the form who has transformed the nature of short fiction in our time. Among the fourteen tales in his seventh collection are the comic yet lyrical title story, in which a young man wins a vicious African cat in a bar bet; "Dogology," about a suburban woman losing her identity to a pack of strays; and "The Kind Assassin,' which explores the consequences of a radio shock jock\'s quest to set a world record for sleeplessness. Muscular, provocative, and blurring the boundaries between humans and nature, the funny and the shocking, Tooth and Claw is Boyle at his best.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/39/9780143037439.jpg", "title_long": "Tooth and Claw...and Other Stories", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 0.57 Inches, Length: 7.72 Inches, Weight: 0.47 Pounds, Width: 5.1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.72}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.47}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.57}}, "pages": 284, "date_published": "2006-06-27", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["T.C.
