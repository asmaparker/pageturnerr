{"book": {"publisher": "William Morrow Paperbacks", "synopsis": ""To say that Babs has been my closest friend for sixteen years is rather like saying that Einstein was good at sums. We were blood sisters from the age of eleven (before my mother prized the razor out of Babs\"s hand)."<br/>But now Babs, noisy and as fun as a day at the beach, is getting married. And Natalie Miller, twenty-seven, senior press officer for the London Ballet, panics. What happens when your best friend pledges everlasting love to someone else?<br/>It doesn\'t help that Nat is dating a guy named Saul Bowcock. As the confetti flutters, her good-girl veneer cracks, and she falls into an alluringly unsuitable affair that spins her crazily out of control. Nat is on the rebound and allergic to the truth—about Babs\'s relationship, her boyfriend\'s ambition, her parents\' divorce, and her golden-boy brother\'s little Australian secret. Her mother\'s lasagna and her roommate Andy\'s fuzzy slippers are also monstrous affronts. But what Nat really needs to face is the mirror—and herself . . . .<br/>Wickedly witty and refreshingly honest, Running in Heels is a hilarious look at the lies we tell ourselves—and the unwanted truths that only our best friends can tell us.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/82/58/9780060988258.jpg", "title_long": "Running in Heels: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.86 Pounds, Width: 1.08 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.08}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.86}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2002-05-28", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Women's Fiction', 'Domestic Life', 'Friendship', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Anna Maxted'], 'title": "Running in Heels: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780060988258", "msrp": 13.48, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060988258", "isbn10": "0060988258", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061862793", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
