{"book": {"publisher": "Fisicalbook", "synopsis": "The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch & Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br/><br/>Scott created these drawings in scratchboard an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.<br/><br/>As the popularity of the recent Lemony Snicket books proves, children never get tired of reading about orphans and their misfortunes. So Frances Hodgson Burnettâ€™s 1905 story about a pampered little rich girl who suddenly finds herself poor and fatherless should continue to entice generations of fans.", "language": "ru", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/42/9781402714542.jpg", "title_long": "a_little_princess", "edition": "Unabridged", "dimensions": "Weight: 0.99 Pounds", "dimensions_structured": {'weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.99}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2016", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet'], 'authors": ["scott-mckowen-frances-hodgson-burnett'], 'title": "a_little_princess", "isbn13": "9781402714542", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "1402714548", "isbn10": "1402714548", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781402792700", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
