Roth watches as his eighty-six-year-old father—famous for his vigor, charm, and his repertoire of Newark recollections—fights the brain tumor that will kill him. The son, full of love, anxiety, and dread, accompanies his father through each fearful stage of his final ordeal, and, as he does so, discloses the survivalist tenacity that has distinguished his father\"s long, stubborn engagement with life.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/36/9780679752936.jpg", "title_long": "Patrimony: A True Story", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.18 Inches, Weight: 0.42549216566 pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.18}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.52}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.42549216566}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.95}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "1996-06-03", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Death & Grief', 'Grief & Bereavement', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Parent & Adult Child', 'Parenting', 'Parenting Boys', 'Parenting Girls', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Philip Roth'], 'title": "Patrimony: A True Story", "isbn13": "9780679752936", "msrp": 16, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0679752935", "isbn10": "0679752935", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780593685037", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
