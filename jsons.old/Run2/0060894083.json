{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial", "synopsis": "“Ridley leaps from chromosome to chromosome in a handy summation of our ever increasing understanding of the roles that genes play in disease, behavior, sexual differences, and even intelligence. . . . . He addresses not only the ethical quandaries faced by contemporary scientists but the reductionist danger in equating inheritability with inevitability.” — The New Yorker<br/>The genome"s been mapped. But what does it mean? Matt Ridley’s Genome is the book that explains it all: what it is, how it works, and what it portends for the future<br/>Arguably the most significant scientific discovery of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers. Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life.<br/>Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington"s disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome. It will help you understand what this scientific milestone means for you, for your children, and for humankind.", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/40/85/9780060894085.jpg", "title_long": "Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.61 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.83}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.61}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2006-05-30", "subjects": ["Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Evolution', 'Genetics', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Modern'], 'authors": ["Matt Ridley'], 'title": "Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters", "isbn13": "9780060894085", "msrp": 16.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "0062253468", "ePub": "0062253468"}, "isbn": "0060894083", "isbn10": "0060894083", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780062253460", "binding": "ebook"}]}}
