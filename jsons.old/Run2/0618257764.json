{"book": {"publisher": "Mariner Books", "synopsis": "From one of America\"s foremost historians, Inventing America compares Thomas Jefferson\"s original draft of the Declaration of Independence with the final, accepted version, thereby challenging many long-cherished assumptions about both the man and the document.
