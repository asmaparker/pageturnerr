In one, with a black cover, she reviews the African experience of her earlier years. In a red one she records her political life, her disillusionment with communism. In a yellow one she writes a novel in which the heroine relives part of her own experience. And in a blue one she keeps a personal diary. Finally, in love with an American writer and threatened with insanity, Anna resolves to bring the threads of all four books together in a golden notebook.<br/>Lessing\'s best-known and most influential novel, The Golden Notebook retains its extraordinary power and relevance decades after its initial publication.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/14/07/9780060931407.jpg", "title_long": "The Golden Notebook: Perennial Classics edition", "dimensions": "Height: 1.7 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 5.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.05}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.7}}, "pages": 672, "date_published": "1999-02-03", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Doris Lessing'], 'title": "The Golden Notebook: Perennial Classics edition", "isbn13": "9780060931407", "msrp": 13.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "006093140X", "isbn10": "006093140X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780062295002", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
