Travel into Japan"s nuttiest apartment house and meet its volatile inhabitants: Kyoko, the beautiful and mysterious new apartment manager; Yusaku, the exam-addled college student; Mrs. Ichinose, the drunken gossip; Kentaro, her bratty son; Akemi, the boozy bar hostess; and the mooching and peeping Mr. Yotsuya. Funny, touching, and a tad off-kilter, Maison Ikkoku is the great Rumiko Takahashi at her very best.<br/><br/>Yusaku ends up in the hospital and has two unexpected visitors. His cute cousin comes to nurse him and Kyoko"s other suitor, Mitaka, ends up being his roommate. Yusaku"s problems aren't over when he's discharged - he has to deal with Kyoko and his school absences.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/52/9781591164852.jpg", "title_long": "Maison Ikkoku, Vol. 7", "edition": "2nd", "dimensions": "Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.52}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.5}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2004-11-02", "subjects": ["Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Romance', 'Media Tie-In'], 'authors": ["Rumiko Takahashi'], 'title": "Maison Ikkoku, Vol. 7", "isbn13": "9781591164852", "msrp": 9.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1591164850", "isbn10": "1591164850"}}
