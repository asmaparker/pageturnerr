{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "My Education is William S. Burroughs\"s final collection, first published two years before his death in 1997. It is a book of dreams, written over several decades and as personal and close to a memoir as we will see. The dreams cover themes from the mundane and ordinary -- conversations with his friends Allen Ginsberg or Ian Sommerville, feeding his cats, procuring drugs or sex -- to the erotic, bizarre, and visionary. Always a rich source of imagery in Burroughs\"s own fiction, in this book, dreams become a direct and powerful force in themselves.<br/><br/>"Mr. Burroughs has lost none of his irreverence or wit, but in recent years he has acquired an elegant, elegiac tone.' – The New York Times', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/45/41/9780140094541.jpg", "title_long": "My Education: A Book of Dreams", "dimensions": "Height: 0.58 Inches, Length: 7.67 Inches, Weight: 0.39 Pounds, Width: 5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.67}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.39}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.58}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "1996-06-01", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Artists, Architects & Photographers', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["William S.
