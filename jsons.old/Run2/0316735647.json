{"book": {"publisher": "Back Bay Books", "synopsis": "Deep inside the Vatican library, a priest discovers the rarest and most valuable art object ever found: the manuscript of The Divine Comedy, written in Dante"s own hand. Via Sicily, the manuscript makes its way from the priest to a mob boss in New York City, where a writer named Nick Tosches is called to authenticate the prize. For this writer, the temptation is too great: he steals the manuscript in a last-chance bid to have it all. Some will find it offensive; others will declare it transcendent; it is certain to be the most ragingly debated novel of the decade.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/43/9780316735643.jpg", "title_long": "In the Hand of Dante: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.77 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.77}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2003-09-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Nick Tosches'], 'title": "In the Hand of Dante: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780316735643", "msrp": 16.99, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0316735647", "isbn10": "0316735647"}}
