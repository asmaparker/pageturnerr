{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Audio UK", "synopsis": "George Eliot"s most ambitious novel is a masterly evocation of diverse lives and changing fortunes in a provincial community. Peopling its landscape are Dorothea Brooke, a young idealist whose search for intellectual fulfillment leads her into a disastrous marriage to the pedantic scholar Casaubon; the charming but tactless Dr Lydgate, whose marriage to the spendthrift beauty Rosamund and pioneering medical methods threaten to undermine his career; and, the religious hypocrite Bulstrode, hiding scandalous crimes from his past. As their stories interweave, George Eliot creates a richly nuanced and moving drama, hailed by Virginia Woolf as "one of the few English novels written for adult people".', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/45/14/9780141804514.jpg", "title_long": "Middlemarch Unabridged Compact Disc", "edition": "Abridged", "dimensions": "Height: 5.66928 Inches, Length: 5.03936 Inches, Weight: 0.49824471212 Pounds, Width: 0.94488 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.03936}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.94488}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.49824471212}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.66928}}, "date_published": "2003-01-28", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction'], 'authors": ['George Eliot'], 'title": "Middlemarch Unabridged Compact Disc", "isbn13": "9780141804514", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Audio CD", "isbn": "0141804513", "isbn10": "0141804513"}}
