For her part, she neither returned his love nor understood him. In an attempt to expain his feelings to her—and to exorcize his love—he dissects his passion. Bringing together the conflicting sides of his nature, the deeply emotional and the coolly analytical, Stendhal constructed a work that is both acutely personal and universally applicable.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
