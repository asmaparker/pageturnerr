{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Sea, The Sea comes a story about revenge and reconciliation, and the difference between being nice and being good.<br/><br/>John Ducane, a respected Whitehall civil servant, is asked to investigate the suicide of a colleague. As he pursues his inquiry, he uncovers a shabby, evil world of murder, blackmail, and black magic. He begins to feel more trapped than trapping.<br/><br/>In contrast to a stagnant summer in London, Octavian and Kate Gray’s adoring community on the Dorset coast seems to offer Ducane refuge, but even here the after-effects of violence poison an atmosphere already electric with adolescent quarrels and intrigue. After a swim into the underworld, Ducane begins to realize that niceness is not enough.<br/><br/>"A feast."--The Guardian", 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/03/41/9780140030341.jpg", "title_long": "The Nice and the Good", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 7.73 Inches, Length: 5.09 Inches, Weight: 0.67461452172 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.09}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.78}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.67461452172}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.73}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "1978-12-14", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Iris Murdoch'], 'title": "The Nice and the Good", "isbn13": "9780140030341", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101495847"}, "isbn": "0140030344", "isbn10": "0140030344", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101495841", "binding": "print"}]}}
