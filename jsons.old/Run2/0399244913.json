{"book": {"publisher": "G.P. Putnam"s Sons Books for Young Readers", "synopsis": "Punctuation play is at its finest in this New York Times #1 bestseller!<br/><br/>Illuminating the comical confusion the lowly comma can cause, this new edition of Eats, Shoots & Leaves uses lively, subversive illustrations to show how misplacing or leaving out a comma can change the meaning of a sentence completely. You might want to eat a huge hot dog, but a huge, hot dog would run away pretty quickly if you tried to take a bite out of him. And a sign saying "Eat here and get gas" would hint at a very different odor than 'Eat here, and get gas.'<br/>This picture book is sure to elicit gales of laughter—and better punctuation—from all who read it.<br/>#1 New York Times Bestseller<br/>Book Sense Book of the Year Honor Book<br/>KidsReads.com Best Book of the Year', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/19/9780399244919.jpg", "title_long": "Eats, Shoots & Leaves: Why, Commas Really Do Make a Difference!", "edition": "Illustrated", "dimensions": "Height: 7.31 Inches, Length: 10.88 Inches, Weight: 0.69 Pounds, Width: 0.35 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.88}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.35}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.69}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.31}}, "pages": 32, "date_published": "2006-07-25", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Education & Reference', 'Reading & Writing', 'Humor', 'General', 'Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Grammar', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Lynne Truss'], 'title": "Eats, Shoots & Leaves: Why, Commas Really Do Make a Difference!", "isbn13": "9780399244919", "msrp": 0.16, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0399244913", "isbn10": "0399244913"}}
