{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin", "synopsis": "Since the original, prewar translation there has been no completely new rendering of the French original into English. This translation brings to the fore a more sharply engaged, comic and lucid Proust. IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME is one of the greatest, most entertaining reading experiences in any language. As the great story unfolds from its magical opening scenes to its devastating end, it is the Penguin Proust that makes Proust accessible to a new generation. Each book is translated by a different, superb translator working under the general editorship of Professor Christopher Prendergast, University of Cambridge.", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/03/66/9780141180366.jpg", "title_long": "In Search of Lost Time : Volume 6 Finding Time Again", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Width: 0.89 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.89}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 720, "date_published": "2002", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors": ["Marcel Proust'], 'title": "In Search of Lost Time : Volume 6 Finding Time Again", "isbn13": "9780141180366", "msrp": 19.6, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0141180366", "isbn10": "0141180366"}}
