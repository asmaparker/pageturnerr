First published by Yale University Press in 1956, it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957 and has since sold more than one million copies. This edition includes a Foreword by Harold Bloom, in which he writes: “By common consent, Long Day’s Journey into Night is Eugene O’Neill’s masterpiece. . . . The helplessness of family love to sustain, let alone heal, the wounds of marriage, of parenthood, and of sonship, have never been so remorselessly and so pathetically portrayed, and with a force of gesture too painful ever to be forgotten by any of us.”", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/56/9780300093056.jpg", "title_long": "Long Day"s Journey into Night", "edition": "2nd", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2002-03-01", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing'], 'authors": ["Eugene O'Neill'], 'title": "Long Day"s Journey into Night", 'isbn13": "9780300093056", "msrp": 13, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0300166222"}, "isbn": "0300093055", "isbn10": "0300093055", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780300166224", "binding": "print"}]}}
