[Barker\"s] extravagantly unconventional inventions are ingenious refractions of our common quest to experience and understand the mysterious world around us and the mysteries within ourselves." — New York Times Book Review<br/>From master storyteller and New York Times bestselling author Clive Barker comes the spectacular sequel to his masterpiece of dark fantasy, The Great and Secret Show, that reveals once again the age-old battle between good and evil.<br/>On the borderland between this world and the world of Quiddity, the sea of our dreams, sits Everville. For years it has lived in ignorance of the gleaming shore on which it lies. But its ignorance is not bliss. Opening the door between worlds, Clive Barker delivers his characters into the heart of the human mystery; into a place of revelation, where the forces which have shaped our past—and are ready to destroy our future—are at work.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/31/59/9780060933159.jpg", "title_long": "Everville", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 1.12 Pounds, Width: 1.59 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.31}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.59}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.12}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 704, "date_published": "1999-11-03", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure'], 'authors": ["Clive Barker'], 'title": "Everville", "isbn13": "9780060933159", "msrp": 18.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0061741817"}, "isbn": "0060933151", "isbn10": "0060933151", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061741814", "binding": "print"}]}}
