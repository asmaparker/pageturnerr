Li Po, a legendary carouser, was an itinerant poet whose writing, often dream poems or spirit-journeys, soars to sublime heights in its descriptions of natural scenes and powerful emotions. His sheer escapism and joy is balanced by Tu Fu, who expresses the Confucian virtues of humanity and humility in more autobiographical works that are imbued with great compassion and earthy reality, and shot through with humour. Together these two poets of the T"ang dynasty complement each other so well that they often came to be spoken of as one – "Li-Tu' – who covers the whole spectrum of human life, experience and feeling.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
