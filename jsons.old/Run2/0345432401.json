{"book": {"publisher": "Ballantine Books", "synopsis": "To Don Raymonde Aprile\"s children he was a loyal family member, their father\"s adopted "nephew.” To the FBI he was a man who would rather ride his horses than do Mob business. No one knew why Aprile, the last great American Don, had adopted Astorre Viola many years before in Sicily; no one suspected how he had carefully trained him . . . and how, while the Don\'s children claimed respectable careers in America, Astorre Viola waited for his time to come.<br/><br/>Now his time has arrived. The Don is dead, his murder one bloody act in a drama of ambition and deceit--from the deadly compromises made by an FBI agent to the greed of two crooked NYPD detectives and the frightening plans of a South American mob kingpin. In a collision of enemies and lovers, betrayers and loyal soldiers, Astorre Viola will claim his destiny. Because after all these years, this moment is in his blood. . . .', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/07/9780345432407.jpg", "title_long": "Omerta: A Novel", "edition": "First Ballantine Books Mass Market Editi", "dimensions": "Height: 6.88 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.19}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.88}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2001-05-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Mario Puzo'], 'title": "Omerta: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780345432407", "msrp": 7.99, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0345432401", "isbn10": "0345432401"}}
