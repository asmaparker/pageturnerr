{"book": {"publisher": "Dover Publications", "synopsis": "Prosperous and socially prominent, George Babbitt appears to have everything a man could wish: good health, a fine family, and a profitable business in a booming Midwestern city. But the middle-aged real estate agent is shaken from his self-satisfaction by a growing restlessness with the limitations of his life. When a personal crisis forces a reexamination of his values, Babbitt mounts a rebellion against social expectations â€” jeopardizing his reputation and business standing as well as his marriage.<br/>Widely considered Sinclair Lewis"s greatest novel, this satire of the American social landscape created a sensation upon its 1922 publication. Babbitt"s name became an instant and enduring synonym for middle-class complacency, and the strictures of his existence revealed the emptiness of the mainstream vision of success. His story reflects the nature of a conformist society, in which the pressures of maintaining propriety can ultimately cause individuals to lose their place in the world.<br/>Babbitt ranks among the important 20th-century works addressing the struggles of people caught in the machinery of modern life, and it remains ever-relevant as a cautionary tale against clinging to conventional values.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/73/9780486431673.jpg", "title_long": "Babbitt (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.5401325419 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5401325419}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2003-09-22", "subjects": ["Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Sinclair Lewis'], 'title": "Babbitt (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)", "isbn13": "9780486431673", "msrp": 6, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"eBook": "0486115208", "ePub": "0486115208"}, "isbn": "0486431673", "isbn10": "0486431673", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780486115207", "binding": "fpid13alias"}]}}
