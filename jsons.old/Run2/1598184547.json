{"book": {"publisher": "Aegypan", "synopsis": "Verne"s 1865 tale of a trip to the moon is (as you"d expect from Verne) great fun, even if bits of it now seem, in retrospect, a little strange. Our rocket ship gets shot out of a cannon? To the moon? Goodness! But in other ways it"s full of eerie bits of business that turned out to be very near reality: he had the cost, when you adjust for inflation, almost exactly right. There are other similarities, too. Verne's cannon was named the Columbiad; the Apollo 11 command module was named Columbia. Apollo 11 had a three-person crew, just as Verne's did; and both blasted off from the American state of Florida. Even the return to earth happened in more-or-less the same place. Coincidence -- or fact!? We say you'll have to read this story yourself to judge.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/49/9781598184549.jpg", "title_long": "From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, Fiction, Fantasy & Magic", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.4629707502 Pounds, Width: 0.32 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.32}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.4629707502}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 136, "date_published": "2006-10-01", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic'], 'authors": ["Jules Verne'], 'title": "From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, Fiction, Fantasy & Magic", "isbn13": "9781598184549", "msrp": 10.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1598184547", "isbn10": "1598184547"}}
