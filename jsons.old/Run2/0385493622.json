What came to be known as Fermat\"s Last Theorem looked simple; proving it, however, became the Holy Grail of mathematics, baffling its finest minds for more than 350 years. In Fermat\'s Enigma--based on the author\'s award-winning documentary film, which aired on PBS\'s 'Nova'--Simon Singh tells the astonishingly entertaining story of the pursuit of that grail, and the lives that were devoted to, sacrificed for, and saved by it. Here is a mesmerizing tale of heartbreak and mastery that will forever change your feelings about mathematics.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/28/9780385493628.jpg", "title_long": "Fermat"s Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World"s Greatest Mathematical Problem', 'edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 6.97 Inches, Length: 4.85 Inches, Weight: 0.5125 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.85}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.9}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.5125}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.97}}, "pages": 315, "date_published": "1998-09-08", "subjects": ["Reference', 'Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'History', 'Research', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors": ["Simon Singh'], 'title": "Fermat"s Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World"s Greatest Mathematical Problem', 'isbn13": "9780385493628", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0525435328"}, "isbn": "0385493622", "isbn10": "0385493622", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780525435327", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
