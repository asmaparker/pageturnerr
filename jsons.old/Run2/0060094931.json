{"book": {"publisher": "Clarion Books", "synopsis": "From the pen of Sir Terry Pratchett, beloved and bestselling author of the Discworld fantasy series comes a comic and insightful trilogy about a race of four-inch-high heroes trying to make sense of a human-size world.<br/>In a world whose seasons are defined by Christmas sales and Spring Fashions, hundreds of tiny nomes live in the corners and crannies of a human-run department store. They have made their homes beneath the floorboards for generations and no longer remember—or even believe in—life beyond the Store walls.<br/>Until the day a small band of nomes arrives at the Store from the Outside. Led by a young nome named Masklin, the Outsiders carry a mysterious black box (called the Thing), and they deliver devastating news: In twenty-one days, the Store will be destroyed.<br/>Now all the nomes must learn to work together, and they must learn to think -- and to think BIG.<br/>Part satire, part parable, and part adventure story par excellence, master storyteller Terry Pratchett’s engaging trilogy traces the nomes’ flight and search for safety, a search that leads them to discover their own astonishing origins and takes them beyond their wildest dreams.<br/>Praise for the Bromeliad trilogy: “Witty, funny, wise, and altogether delightful.”—Locus Magazine<br/>Meet more of Sir Terry Pratchett’s tiny-but-fierce heroes in the Discworld novel The Wee Free Men!", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/49/35/9780060094935.jpg", "title_long": "The Bromeliad Trilogy: Truckers, Diggers, and Wings", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.56 Pounds, Width: 1.53 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.53}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.56}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9}}, "pages": 512, "date_published": "2003-09-30", "subjects": ["Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Humorous', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Terry Pratchett'], 'title": "The Bromeliad Trilogy: Truckers, Diggers, and Wings", "isbn13": "9780060094935", "msrp": 15.13, "binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0060094931", "isbn10": "0060094931", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780062193810", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}, {"isbn": "9780062193827", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
