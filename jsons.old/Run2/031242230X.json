{"book": {"publisher": "Picador", "synopsis": "In Hermann Hesse"s Beneath the Wheel, Hans Giebernath lives among the dull and respectable townsfolk of a sleepy Black Forest village. When he is discovered to be an exceptionally gifted student, the entire community presses him onto a path of serious scholarship. Hans dutifully follows the regimen of study and endless examinations, his success rewarded only with more crushing assignments. When Hans befriends a rebellious young poet, he begins to imagine other possibilities outside the narrowly circumscribed world of the academy. Finally sent home after a nervous breakdown, Hans is revived by nature and romance, and vows never to return to the gray conformity of the academic system.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/01/9780312422301.jpg", "title_long": "Beneath the Wheel", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.4499891 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4499891}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2003-07-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Hermann Hesse'], 'title": "Beneath the Wheel", "isbn13": "9780312422301", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "031242230X", "isbn10": "031242230X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781466835047", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
