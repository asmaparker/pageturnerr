As Scarpetta slowly closes in on a killer known as Mr. Nobody, she gets the creepy, well-informed feeling that the killer is closing in on her. Cornwell"s debut swept the mystery-writing awards and made her somebody. In Body of Evidence, Scarpetta investigates the murder of a Southern writer who mysteriously opened the door for her killer. In All That Remains, she hunts a serial killer of young lovers--including the daughter of the president"s drug czar, which complicates the forensic chase with political intrigue.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/20/9780765191120.jpg", "title_long": "Postmortem / Body of Evidence / All That Remains (Kay Scarpetta)", "dimensions": "Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 2.37217393912 Pounds, Width: 2.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 2.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.37217393912}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.5}}, "pages": 832, "date_published": "1997", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors": ["Patricia Cornwell'], 'title": "Postmortem / Body of Evidence / All That Remains (Kay Scarpetta)", "isbn13": "9780765191120", "msrp": 14.98, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0765191121", "isbn10": "0765191121"}}
