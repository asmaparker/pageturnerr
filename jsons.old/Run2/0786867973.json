{"book": {"publisher": "Hyperion", "synopsis": "The trouble with much modern cooking is that the mood it induces in the cook is one of skin-of-the-teeth efficiency, all briskness and little pleasure. Sometimes that"s the best we can manage, but at other times we don"t want to feel stressed and overstretched, but like a domestic goddess, trailing nutmeggy fumes of baking pie in our languorous wake.... --from How to Be a Domestic Goddess<br/>How to Be a Domestic Goddess is not about being a goddess, but about feeling like one. What this deliciously mouthwatering cookbook demonstrates is that it"s not actually hard to bake a pan of muffins or a sponge layer cake, but the appreciation and satisfaction they bring are disproportionately high. Filled with over 220 gorgeously illustrated recipes, this book understands our anxieties, feeds our fantasies, and puts cakes, pies, pastries, preserves, puddings, breads, and cookies back in our own kitchens. The domestic goddess has to maintain her (or his) cool when faced with pastry, of course -- but with Nigella Lawson's guidance, even puff pastry can be pain-free.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/74/9780786867974.jpg", "title_long": "How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 3.1 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 3.1}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.75}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2001-11-14", "subjects": ["Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Baking', 'Bread', 'Cooking by Ingredient', 'Herbs, Spices & Condiments', 'Regional & International', 'U.S. Regional'], 'authors": ["Nigella Lawson'], 'title": "How to Be a Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking", "isbn13": "9780786867974", "msrp": 35, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0786867973", "isbn10": "0786867973"}}
