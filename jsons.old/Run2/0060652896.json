Enter Screwtape, an experienced devil. His nephew Wormwood is just at the start of his career as a tempter and has been assigned to secure the damnation of an ordinary young man who has just become a Christian.? In this slyly humorous exchange, C. S. Lewis delves into moral questions about good and evil, temptation, repentance, and grace. Though the cunning actions of Wormwood and Screwtape occur nearly 100 years ago, readers will marvel at the parallels to modern life today.<br/>This is a book for C. S. Lewis fans and anyone who wants to take a deep dive into what it means to be a human. Lewis uses The Screwtape Letters to convey religious concepts like temptation in an understandable way by exploring free will and how it is humanity’s greatest weakness as well as its greatest strength, sharing thoughts on God’s love and how He uses your pain and suffering to bring you closer to Him, and living by faith and not by your feelings within community.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/90/9780060652890.jpg", "title_long": "The Screwtape Letters: With Screwtape Proposes a Toast", "edition": "Revised", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85539357656 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.81}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85539357656}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 209, "date_published": "2001-03-06", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Spiritual Warfare', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics & Allegories', 'Theology', 'Angelology & Demonology', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies', 'Ethics'], 'authors": ["C.
