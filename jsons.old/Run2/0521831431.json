{"book": {"publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "synopsis": "An accessible introduction to string theory, this book provides a detailed and self-contained demonstration of the main concepts involved. The first part deals with basic ideas, reviewing special relativity and electromagnetism while introducing the concept of extra dimensions. D-branes and the classical dynamics of relativistic strings are discussed next, and the quantization of open and closed bosonic strings in the light-cone gauge, along with a brief introduction to superstrings. The second part begins with a detailed study of D-branes followed by string thermodynamics. It discusses possible physical applications, and covers T-duality of open and closed strings, electromagnetic fields on D-branes, Born/Infeld electrodynamics, covariant string quantization and string interactions. Primarily aimed as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, it will also be ideal for a wide range of scientists and mathematicians who are curious about string theory.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/37/9780521831437.jpg", "title_long": "A First Course in String Theory", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 2.99167289534 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.25}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 2.99167289534}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.75}}, "pages": 558, "date_published": "2004-06-28", "subjects": ["Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Mathematical Physics', 'Quantum Theory', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Barton Zwiebach'], 'title": "A First Course in String Theory", "isbn13": "9780521831437", "msrp": 80, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "0521831431", "isbn10": "0521831431"}}
