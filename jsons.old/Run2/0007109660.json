{"book": {"publisher": "HarperCollins Publishers Ltd", "synopsis": "The beast is alive and prowling the high seas. As extremist Islamic pirates, armed and supported by a powerful Saudi terrorist, prey on civilian vessels in the Gulf of Aden, America aggressively answers with serious muscle -- a next-generation littoral warship with a full range of automated weapons systems that the enemy has dubbed "Satan\"s Tail." However, unforeseen technological problems combined with the suicidal tendencies of a fanatical foe mean support is needed from above -- and a pair of Dreamland\'s awesome Megafortresses and their Flighthawk escorts are dispatched to the war zone. But bitter professional rivalries threaten to damage, perhaps even destroy, the mission, as a vengeful opponent takes advantage of the disruption -- to strengthen his outlaw navy and set its sights horrifically high -- raising the stakes in a battle the U.S. and the world simply cannot afford to lose.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/96/61/9780007109661.jpg", "title_long": "Dreamland", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.37007 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.37007}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.96}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.440924524}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.00786}}, "pages": 375, "date_published": "2001", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Action & Adventure', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics'], 'authors": ["Dale Brown', 'Jim DeFelice'], 'title": "Dreamland", "isbn13": "9780007109661", "msrp": 14.45, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0007109660", "isbn10": "0007109660"}}
