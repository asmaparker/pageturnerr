{"book": {"publisher": "Harcourt, Inc.", "synopsis": "When Abigail Thomas’s husband, Rich, was hit by a car, his brain shattered. Subject to rages, terrors, and hallucinations, he must live the rest of his life in an institution. He has no memory of what he did the hour, the day, the year before. This tragedy is the ground on which Abigail had to build a new life. How she built that life is a story of great courage and great change, of moving to a small country town, of a new family composed of three dogs, knitting, and friendship, of facing down guilt and discovering gratitude. It is also about her relationship with Rich, a man who lives in the eternal present, and the eerie poetry of his often uncanny perceptions. This wise, plainspoken, beautiful book enacts the truth Abigail discovered in the five years since the accident: You might not find meaning in disaster, but you might, with effort, make something useful of it.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/14/9780151012114.jpg", "title_long": "A Three Dog Life: A Memoir", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 7.2499855 Inches, Length: 4.99999 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.7999984 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.99999}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.7999984}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.2499855}}, "pages": 192, "date_published": "2006-09-05", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Dogs', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Mental & Spiritual Healing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Abigail Thomas'], 'title": "A Three Dog Life: A Memoir", "isbn13": "9780151012114", "msrp": 22, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0156033062", "ePub": "0156033062"}, "isbn": "0151012113", "isbn10": "0151012113", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780156033060", "binding": "print"}]}}
