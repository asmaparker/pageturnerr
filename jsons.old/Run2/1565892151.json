Yet, despite our desperate search for happiness, according to a recent Gallup Poll, only a minority of North Americans describe themselves as ?very happy.? It seems that very few of us have truly unlocked the secrets of lasting joy and inner peace. Now, in this volume of all-new, never-before-released material, Paramhansa Yogananda? who has hundreds of thousands of followers and admirers in North America?playfully and powerfully explains virtually everything needed to lead a happier, more fulfilling life. Topics covered include: looking for happiness in the right places; choosing to be happy; tools and techniques for achieving happiness; sharing happiness with others; balancing success and happiness, and many more. The Wisdom of Yogananda series features writings of Paramhansa Yogananda not available elsewhere. These books capture the Master?s expansive and compassionate wisdom, his sense of fun, and his practical spiritual guidance. The books include writings from his earliest years in America, in an approachable, easy-to-read format.
