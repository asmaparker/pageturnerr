Ambitiously tackling the nature of economic life and how to study it comparatively, the book includes six studies which reflect the author"s ideas on revising traditional views of the hunter-gatherer and so-called primitive societies, revealing them to be the original affluent society.<br/>The book examines notions of production, distribution and exchange in early communities and examines the link between economics and cultural and social factors. It consists of a set of detailed and closely related studies of tribal economies, of domestic production for livelihood, and of the submission of domestic production to the material and political demands of society at large.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/91/9780202010991.jpg", "title_long": "Stone Age Economics", "edition": "1", "dimensions": "Height: 1 Inches, Length: 8.9 Inches, Weight: 1.14860838502 Pounds, Width: 6 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.9}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.14860838502}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}}, "pages": 362, "date_published": "1972-01-01", "subjects": ["Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Comparative', 'Economic Conditions', 'Economic History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'General', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Marshall Sahlins'], 'title": "Stone Age Economics", "isbn13": "9780202010991", "msrp": 48.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1000159876"}, "isbn": "0202010996", "isbn10": "0202010996", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781000159875", "binding": "print"}]}}
