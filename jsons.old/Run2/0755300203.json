{"book": {"publisher": "Gardners Books", "synopsis": "Freedom - in eleventh-century France, it is a luxury enjoyed by only the King and nobility. For the serf, it is surely worth fighting for. But is it worth dying for? Arriving home disillusioned from the Crusades, Hugh DeLuc discovers his village has been ransacked and his wife abducted. The dark riders came in the dead of night, like devils, wearing no colours but black crosses on their chests. They search for a relic, one worth more than any throne in Europe, and no man can stand in their way. Until Hugh, taking on the role of a jester, is able to infiltrate the enemy\"s castle where he believes his wife is being held captive. And when a man is fighting for freedom - for his wife, and for everything he holds dear - he will prove a formidable opponent. With the unstoppable pace of a page-turning thriller, "The Jester" is a breathtaking, pulse-pounding adventure. No one who has ever hoped for good to defeat evil or for love to conquer all will be able to put down this masterful novel.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/04/9780755300204.jpg", "title_long": "The Jester", "dimensions": "Height: 6.92912 Inches, Length: 4.3307 Inches, Weight: 0.60406659788 Pounds, Width: 1.29921 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.3307}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.29921}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.60406659788}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.92912}}, "pages": 544, "date_published": "2004-03", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Psychological', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Women's Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors": ['James Patterson', 'Andrew Gross'], 'title": "The Jester", "isbn13": "9780755300204", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0755300203", "isbn10": "0755300203"}}
