The first entry included here is dated 1918 and the last, three weeks before her death in 1941. Between these points of time unfolds the private world—the anguish, the triumph, the creative vision—of one of the great writers of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>“A Writer’s Diary . . . is Virginia Woolf . . .
