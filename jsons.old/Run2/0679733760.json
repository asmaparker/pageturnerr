On the basis of that diary, Laurel Thatcher Ulrich gives us an intimate and densely imagined portrait, not only of the industrious and reticent Martha Ballard but of her society. At once lively and impeccably scholarly, A Midwife\"s Tale is a triumph of history on a human scale.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/68/9780679733768.jpg", "title_long": "A Midwife"s Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812", 'edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.72532084198 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.11}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.93}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.76279942652}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.97}}, "pages": 444, "date_published": "1991-06-04", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'History', 'Americas', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Women's Studies', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Laurel Thatcher Ulrich'], 'title": "A Midwife"s Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812", 'isbn13": "9780679733768", "msrp": 15.98, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307772985"}, "isbn": "0679733760", "isbn10": "0679733760", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307772985", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
