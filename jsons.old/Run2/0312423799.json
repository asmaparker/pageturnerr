{"book": {"publisher": "Picador", "synopsis": "From the bestselling author of Running with Scissors comes Dry―the hilarious, moving, and no less bizarre account of what happened next.<br/>You may not know it, but you"ve met Augusten Burroughs. You"ve seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twenty-something guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had to drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls, and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn"t really a request) of his employers, Augusten landed in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey, Jr., are immediately dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click, and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life―and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is real. Dry is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a higher power.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/97/9780312423797.jpg", "title_long": "Dry: A Memoir", "edition": "REV", "dimensions": "Height: 8.32 Inches, Length: 5.41 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.835 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.41}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.835}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.32}}, "pages": 309, "date_published": "2004-04-01", "subjects": ["Self-Help', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Regional U.S.', 'Mid Atlantic', 'LGBTQ+ Books', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Addiction & Recovery', 'Alcoholism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Augusten Burroughs'], 'title": "Dry: A Memoir", "isbn13": "9780312423797", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0312423799", "isbn10": "0312423799"}}
