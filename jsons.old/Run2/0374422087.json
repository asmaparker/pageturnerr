I am eleven years old. I have hair the color of carrots in apricot glaze (recipe to follow), skin fair and clear where it isn"t freckled, and eyes like summer storms.<br/><br/>Readers will know right from the start that the narrator of Everything on a Waffle is going to tell her story straight and pull no punches. Primrose"s parents have been lost at sea, but she believes without an iota of doubt that they are still alive, somewhere. She moves in with her Uncle Jack, but feels generally friendless. Her only real refuge is a local restaurant called The Girl on the Red Swing, where the owner, Miss Bowzer, serves everything on waffles -- except advice and good sense, which come free of charge and are always reliable.<br/><br/>Food in general plays an important role in Primrose"s journey toward peace and understanding (a recipe dictated in her unmistakable voice is appended to each chapter), and readers will eagerly cheer her on through this funny, bittersweet novel.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/80/9780374422080.jpg", "title_long": "Everything on a Waffle", "dimensions": "Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}}, "pages": 160, "date_published": "2004-09-08", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life'], 'authors": ['Polly Horvath'], 'title": "Everything on a Waffle", "isbn13": "9780374422080", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0374422087", "isbn10": "0374422087"}}
