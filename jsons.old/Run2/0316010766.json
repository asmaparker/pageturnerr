{"book": {"publisher": "Back Bay Books", "synopsis": "In the stories that make up Oblivion, David Foster Wallace joins the rawest, most naked humanity with the infinite involutions of self-consciousness -- a combination that is dazzlingly, uniquely his.<br/><br/>These are worlds undreamt of by any other mind. Only David Foster Wallace could convey a father\"s desperate loneliness by way of his son\"s daydreaming through a teacher\"s homicidal breakdown ('The Soul Is Not a Smithy'). Or could explore the deepest and most hilarious aspects of creativity by delineating the office politics surrounding a magazine profile of an artist who produces miniature sculptures in an anatomically inconceivable way ('The Suffering Channel'). Or capture the ache of love\'s breakdown in the painfully polite apologies of a man who believes his wife is hallucinating the sound of his snoring ('Oblivion').<br/><br/>Each of these stories is a complete world, as fully imagined as most entire novels, at once preposterously surreal and painfully immediate.<br/><br/>'Stunning...Wallace is an astonishing storyteller whose fiction reminds us why we learned to read in the first place.' --San Francisco Chronicle', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/64/9780316010764.jpg", "title_long": "Oblivion: Stories", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2005-08-30", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["David Foster Wallace'], 'title": "Oblivion: Stories", "isbn13": "9780316010764", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0316010766", "isbn10": "0316010766"}}
