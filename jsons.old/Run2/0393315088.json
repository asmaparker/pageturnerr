{"book": {"publisher": "W. W. Norton & Company", "synopsis": "Set in the near future, The Wanting Seed is a Malthusian comedy about the strange world overpopulation will produce. Tristram Foxe and his wife, Beatrice-Joanna, live in their skyscraper world where official family limitation glorifies homosexuality. Eventually, their world is transformed into a chaos of cannibalistic dining-clubs, fantastic fertility rituals, and wars without anger. It is a novel both extravagantly funny and grimly serious.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/80/9780393315080.jpg", "title_long": "The Wanting Seed (Norton Paperback Fiction)", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.4}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.8}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 288, "date_published": "1996-12-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors": ["Anthony Burgess'], 'title": "The Wanting Seed (Norton Paperback Fiction)", "isbn13": "9780393315080", "msrp": 14.95, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0393315088", "isbn10": "0393315088", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780393285727", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
