{"book": {"publisher": "Harper Perennial", "synopsis": ""I will say no more about this lacerating book except to urge it upon all who care about literature in our difficult era." — Boston Globe<br/>"A sly and merciless lampoon of revolutionary romanticism. . . Kundera commits some of the funniest literary savaging since Evelyn Waugh polished off Dickens in A Handful of Dust.'— Time<br/>Milan Kundera initially intended to call this novel The Lyrical Age. The lyrical age, according to him, is youth, and this novel, above all, is an epic of adolescence; an ironic epic that tenderly erodes sacrosanct values: childhood, motherhood, revolution, and even poetry.<br/>Jaromil is in fact a poet. His mother made him a poet and accompanies him (figuratively) to his love bed and (literally) to his deathbed. A ridiculous and touching character, horrifying and totally innocent ('innocence with its bloody smile'!), Jaromil is at the same time a true poet. He\'s no creep, he\'s Rimbaud. Rimbaud entrapped by the communist revolution, entrapped in a somber farce.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/70/21/9780060997021.jpg", "title_long": "Life Is Elsewhere", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 1.04 Inches, Length: 8.12 Inches, Weight: 0.73 Pounds, Width: 5.34 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.34}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.73}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.04}}, "pages": 432, "date_published": "2000-07-25", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'Psychological', 'World Literature', 'European', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Milan Kundera'], 'title": "Life Is Elsewhere", "isbn13": "9780060997021", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060997028", "isbn10": "0060997028", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780063290679", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
