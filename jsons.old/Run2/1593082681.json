But for his creator, &&LB&&RFord Madox Ford&&L/B&&R, he also represents the corruption at society’s core. Beneath Ashburnham’s charming, polished exterior lurks a soul well-versed in the arts of deception, hypocrisy, and betrayal. Throughout the nine years of his friendship with an equally privileged American, John Dowell, Ashburnham has been having an affair with Dowell’s wife, Florence. Unlike Dowell, Ashburnham’s own wife, Leonora, is well aware of it. &&LBR&&R&&LBR&&RWhen &&LI&&RThe Good Soldier&&L/I&&R was first published in 1915, its pitiless portrait of an amoral society dedicated to its own pleasure and convinced of its own superiority outraged many readers. Stylistically daring, &&LI&&RThe Good Soldier&&L/I&&R is narrated, unreliably, by the naïve Dowell, through whom Ford provides a level of bitter irony. Dowell’s disjointed, stumbling storytelling not only subverts linear temporality to satisfying effect, it also reflects his struggle to accept a world without honor, order, or permanence. Called the best French novel in the English language, &&LI&&RThe Good Soldier&&L/I&&R is both tragic and darkly comic, and it established Ford as an important contributor to the development of literary modernism.&&LBR&&R&&L/P&&R&&LP style='MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt'&&R&&LSTRONG&&RFrank Kermode&&L/B&&R has taught at Manchester, London, and Cambridge Universities as well as at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia.
