{"book": {"publisher": "Anchor", "synopsis": "PULITZER PRIZE WINNER • NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A "powerful and poignant" twentieth-century reimagining of Shakespeare’s King Lear (The New York Times Book Review) that takes on themes of truth, justice, love, and pride—and centers on a wealthy Iowa farmer who decides to divide his farm between his three daughters.<br/><br/>When the youngest daughter objects, she is cut out of his will. This sets off a chain of events that brings dark truths to light and explodes long-suppressed emotions. Ambitiously conceived and stunningly written, A Thousand Acres reveals the beautiful yet treacherous topography of humanity.<br/><br/>“A family portrait that is also a near-epic investigation into the broad landscape, the thousand dark acres of the human heart.... The book has all the stark brutality of a Shakespearean tragedy.” —The Washington Post Book World", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/36/9781400033836.jpg", "title_long": "A Thousand Acres: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.17 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.17}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.84}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.98}}, "pages": 384, "date_published": "2003", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Jane Smiley'], 'title": "A Thousand Acres: A Novel", "isbn13": "9781400033836", "msrp": 16.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0307787710", "ePub": "0307787710"}, "isbn": "1400033837", "isbn10": "1400033837", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307787712", "binding": "print"}]}}
