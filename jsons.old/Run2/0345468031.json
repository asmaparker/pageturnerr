Not only has the world lost one of its preeminent, Pulitzer Prize—winning American Revolution historians, but R has lost his mentor, the man who led him to devote his life’s work to the study of “The First American,” Benjamin Franklin. The bond between them was sealed when R did Wally a favor that could never be revealed. But Wally saved one final secret for R, disclosed in a letter conveyed by the will’s executor.<br/><br/>Written in the slow, painful script of the professor’s last days, the note delivers an incredible bombshell. Wally, it seems, had stumbled upon twelve handwritten pages in a code commonly used by spies during the revolutionary war. The pages refer to George Washington, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison, and level a shocking charge–that Benjamin Franklin committed a heinous crime.<br/><br/>Wally, not wanting to foul the image of his lifelong hero, had kept this monumental secret until his death. But as R races to unravel the mystery, he faces an onslaught of obstacles. Vicious blackmail, a threat of sabotage against his own career, and grave personal doubts threaten to overtake R as he struggles with a discovery that has the potential to completely alter the fabric of American history.<br/><br/>Rich with revelations, rife with the darkest depths of deceit and mystery, and enlightened by the unparalleled insights of America’s first patriots, The Franklin Affair is a tense, constantly surprising novel about the ultimate quest for truth and justice.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/31/9780345468031.jpg", "title_long": "The Franklin Affair: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.15}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.5}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.35}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 208, "date_published": "2006-06-13", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense'], 'authors": ["Jim Lehrer'], 'title": "The Franklin Affair: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780345468031", "msrp": 15, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345468031", "isbn10": "0345468031"}}
