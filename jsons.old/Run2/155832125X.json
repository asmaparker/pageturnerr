{"book": {"publisher": "Harvard Common Press", "synopsis": "It"s easy for any backyard chef to serve up tantalizing food from the grill! Paul Kirk offers 175 winning recipes that impart bold, zesty flavor to every cut of meat. Kirk covers the classic American sauces - with tomatoes, mustard, sugar, or vinegar at their base - and offers up a wealth of fresh and creative brews flavored with such things as raspberries, pineapple, ginger, chile peppers, and more. In special Master Classes and elsewhere, Kirk reveals the basic building blocks of spice mixtures, rubs, marinades, bastes, and sauces. He explains how to layer them during the cooking process, so that grilled or barbecued food not only smacks of flavor, but brisket is more tender, steaks form a crispy crust, and ribs melt in the mouth.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/50/9781558321250.jpg", "title_long": "Paul Kirk"s Championship Barbecue Sauces: 175 Make-Your-Own Sauces, Marinades, Dry Rubs, Wet Rubs, Mops and Salsas", 'edition": "Non", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.625 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.625}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 272, "date_published": "1997-12-03", "subjects": ["Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Main Courses & Side Dishes', 'Sauces & Toppings', 'Outdoor Cooking', 'Barbecuing & Grilling'], 'authors": ["Paul Kirk'], 'title": "Paul Kirk"s Championship Barbecue Sauces: 175 Make-Your-Own Sauces, Marinades, Dry Rubs, Wet Rubs, Mops and Salsas", 'isbn13": "9781558321250", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1558325123"}, "isbn": "155832125X", "isbn10": "155832125X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781558325128", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
