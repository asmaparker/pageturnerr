{"book": {"publisher": "WaterBrook", "synopsis": "And now back to our regularly scheduled insanity.<br/><br/>Channel 7 news producer Hugo Talley dreams of working with first-class professionals. Instead he’s saddled with a weatherman who can’t admit when he’s wrong, an aging anchorwoman who refuses to release her clawlike grip on the newsdesk, a conscience-stricken reporter who’s reluctant to focus on sensationalism, and a new assistant–former homeschool student Hayden Hazard–who can’t just seem to leave her faith outside the newsroom.<br/><br/>When the Channel News 7 team inadvertently stumbles on a hot news story, Hugo is frantic to exploit this rare opportunity. But a series of crises–including a Botox disaster and the disappearance of a colleague–threatens to destroy his chance for ratings success and send him completely over the edge.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Hayden’s presence is distracting at least two coworkers. Softspoken reporter Ray Duffey isn’t sure whether he’s attracted or frightened by her outspoken faith, while ego-driven Sam Leege is certain her naïve spiritual convictions will fall victim to his persuasive attentions.<br/><br/>With their oddball antics and all-too-real foibles, this lovable cast of characters offers a hilarious look at the sometimes-unexpected effects of taking one’s faith boldly into the workplace.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/79/9781400071579.jpg", "title_long": "Scoop (Occupational Hazards, Book 1)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.25}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2006-10-10", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Women's Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors": ["Rene Gutteridge'], 'title": "Scoop (Occupational Hazards, Book 1)", "isbn13": "9781400071579", "msrp": 12.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "0307499626"}, "isbn": "1400071577", "isbn10": "1400071577", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780307499622", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
