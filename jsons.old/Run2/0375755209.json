{"book": {"publisher": "Random House Trade Paperbacks", "synopsis": "In Nine Horses, Billy Collins, America’s Poet Laureate for 2001–2003, continues his delicate negotiation between the clear and the mysterious, the comic and the elegiac. The poems in this collection reach dazzling heights while being firmly grounded in the everyday. Traveling by train, lying on a beach, and listening to jazz on the radio are the seemingly ordinary activities whose hidden textures are revealed by Collins’s poetic eye. With clarity, precision, and enviable wit, Collins transforms those moments we too often take for granted into brilliant feats of creative imagination. Nine Horses is a poetry collection to savor and to share.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/00/9780375755200.jpg", "title_long": "Nine Horses: Poems", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.26 Pounds, Width: 0.31 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.16}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.31}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.26}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.97}}, "pages": 144, "date_published": "2003-10-14", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Genres & Styles', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Themes & Styles', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Billy Collins'], 'title": "Nine Horses: Poems", "isbn13": "9780375755200", "msrp": 16, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0375755209", "isbn10": "0375755209"}}
