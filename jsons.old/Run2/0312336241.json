{"book": {"publisher": "St. Martin"s Griffin", "synopsis": "Lilith, the consort of the Unnamed One, has released the Damned, tortured souls from all levels of Hell, to walk the streets as the living dead. A dark chaos leaks onto Earth, taking the form of a deadly contagion that not even the Neteru team can handle. One touch from these deadly creatures infects a human, driving him to madness, death…and worse.<br/><br/>This time, Damali Richards, the Vampire Huntress (aka the millennium Neteru), Carlos, and the Guardians cannot effectively close ranks. The infection spreads to key team members and threatens to wipe out the entire squad. Even the Covenant is infected. They must track down the Chairman before members of the Neteru-Guardian team are lost and the team implodes. The only antidote is to behead Lilith. But first they must find her.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/40/9780312336240.jpg", "title_long": "The Damned: A Vampire Huntress Legend (Vampire Huntress Legends, 6)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.11 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.11}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.4}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.5}}, "pages": 496, "date_published": "2006-01-24", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Vampires', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Romantic'], 'authors": ["L.
