{"book": {"publisher": "Clarion Books", "synopsis": "A big, ugly dog is happy to meet a farmer and his wife who decide to give him a name and a home, but not so happy when they chain him to the barn. All Orville can do is bark to tell the world how unhappy he is, and the more he barks, the more he is left alone. But everything changes when Sally MacIntosh moves into the little house across the road and Orville falls in love.<br/>A beautifully crafted text that blends wry humor with the poignant twang of a country-and-western song is accompanied by dreamy, spare watercolor-and-ink illustrations for a fresh, original picture book that will resonate with anyone who has ever felt lonely or misunderstood.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/50/9780618159550.jpg", "title_long": "Orville: A Dog Story", "edition": "-", "dimensions": "Height: 6.499987 Inches, Length: 10.499979 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.12499975 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.499979}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.12499975}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.7}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.499987}}, "pages": 32, "date_published": "2003-09-22", "subjects": ["Children's Books', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life'], 'authors": ["Haven Kimmel'], 'title": "Orville: A Dog Story", "isbn13": "9780618159550", "msrp": 15, 'binding": "Hardcover", "isbn": "061815955X", "isbn10": "061815955X"}}
