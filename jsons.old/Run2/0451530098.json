{"book": {"publisher": "Signet", "synopsis": "The ancient Greeks tell the legend of the sculptor Pygmalion, who created a statue of a woman of such surpassing beauty that he fell in love with his own creation. Then, Aphrodite, taking pity on this man whose love could not reach beyond the barrier of stone, brought the statue to life and gave her to Pygmalion as his bride.<br/>Centuries later, George Bernard Shaw captured the magic of this legend in his celebrated romantic play, Pygmalion. Pygmalion became Henry Higgins, a professor of phonetics, his statue an untutored flower girl from the streets of London, and the barrier between them the difference in their stations in life.<br/>In My Fair Lady, Alan Jay Lerner takes the legend one step further—the barrier is swept away and Higgins and Eliza are reunited as the curtain falls on one of the loveliest musical plays of our time—winning seven Tonys® for its original Broadway production, and seven Oscars® for its film adaptation.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/97/9780451530097.jpg", "title_long": "Pygmalion and My Fair Lady (Signet Classics)", "edition": "50th Anniversary", "dimensions": "Height: 6.78 Inches, Length: 4.17 Inches, Weight: 0.250004205108 Pounds, Width: 0.63 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.17}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.63}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.250004205108}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.78}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2006-03-07", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["George Bernard Shaw', 'Alan Jay Lerner'], 'title": "Pygmalion and My Fair Lady (Signet Classics)", "isbn13": "9780451530097", "msrp": 5.95, 'binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "isbn": "0451530098", "isbn10": "0451530098"}}
