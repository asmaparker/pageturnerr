{"book": {"publisher": "Picador", "synopsis": "From the creator of HBO"s The Wire, the classic book about homicide investigation that became the basis for the hit television show<br/><br/>The scene is Baltimore. Twice every three days another citizen is shot, stabbed, or bludgeoned to death. At the center of this hurricane of crime is the city"s homicide unit, a small brotherhood of hard men who fight for whatever justice is possible in a deadly world.<br/><br/>David Simon was the first reporter ever to gain unlimited access to a homicide unit, and this electrifying book tells the true story of a year on the violent streets of an American city. The narrative follows Donald Worden, a veteran investigator; Harry Edgerton, a black detective in a mostly white unit; and Tom Pellegrini, an earnest rookie who takes on the year"s most difficult case, the brutal rape and murder of an eleven-year-old girl.<br/><br/>Originally published fifteen years ago, Homicide became the basis for the acclaimed television show of the same name. This new edition―which includes a new introduction, an afterword, and photographs―revives this classic, riveting tale about the men who work on the dark side of the American experience.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/59/9780805080759.jpg", "title_long": "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.259826 Inches, Length: 6.2999874 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.16 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.2999874}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.16}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.15}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.259826}}, "pages": 672, "date_published": "2006-08-22", "subjects": ["Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Espionage', 'Murder & Mayhem', 'Law', 'Criminal Law', 'Law Enforcement', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology', 'Sociology', 'Urban', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors": ["David Simon'], 'title": "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets", "isbn13": "9780805080759", "msrp": 24, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0805080759", "isbn10": "0805080759", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781429900959", "binding": "printisbncanonical"}]}}
