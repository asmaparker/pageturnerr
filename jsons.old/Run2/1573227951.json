{"book": {"publisher": "Riverhead Books", "synopsis": "A national bestseller and one of the New York Public Library\"s Books to Remember, An Instance of the Fingerpost is a thrilling historical mystery from Iain Pears.<br/><br/>"It is 1663, and England is wracked with intrigue and civil strife. When an Oxford don is murdered, it seems at first that the incident can have nothing to do with great matters of church and state....Yet, little is as it seems in this gripping novel, which dramatizes the ways in which witnesses can see the same events yet remember them falsely. Each of four narrators—a Venetian medical student, a young man intent on proving his late father innocent of treason, a cryptographer, and an archivist—fingers a different culprit...an erudite and entertaining tour de force." —People<br/><br/>Iain Pears\'s The Dream of Scipio and The Portrait are also available from Riverhead Books.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/57/9781573227957.jpg", "title_long": "An Instance of the Fingerpost", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 9.04 Inches, Length: 6.03 Inches, Weight: 1.75 Pounds, Width: 1.61 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.03}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.61}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.75}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.04}}, "pages": 704, "date_published": "2000-04-01", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Iain Pears'], 'title": "An Instance of the Fingerpost", "isbn13": "9781573227957", "msrp": 18, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "1573227951", "isbn10": "1573227951"}}
