This mind-bending Pip and Flinx adventure is a roller-coaster ride into the unknown, filled with wonder and humor, and a host of deadly adversaries.<br/><br/>Using his enhanced empathic abilities, Flinx finesses his way into a top-secret security installation on Earth. Once there, he bamboozles a sophisticated AI program into releasing classified information about the Meliorare Society, the sect of renegade eugenicists whose experiments with human beings had horrified the civilized universe more than twenty years ago. After all, as one of the few Meliorare experiments to survive, Flinx has a right to know about his past. Especially since his telepathic powers seem to be evolving. The question is, evolving into what? The excruciating headaches afflicting Flinx with increasing frequency make him wonder if he will be alive to find out. . . .", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/85/9780345418685.jpg", "title_long": "Reunion: A Pip and Flinx novel (Adventures of Pip & Flinx)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 6.84 Inches, Length: 4.12 Inches, Weight: 0.43651527876 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.76}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.43651527876}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.84}}, "pages": 342, "date_published": "2002-02-26", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera'], 'authors": ["Alan Dean Foster'], 'title": "Reunion: A Pip and Flinx novel (Adventures of Pip & Flinx)", "isbn13": "9780345418685", "msrp": 7.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0345454588", "ePub": "0345454588"}, "isbn": "0345418689", "isbn10": "0345418689", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780345454584", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
