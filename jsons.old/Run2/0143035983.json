{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "Look out for a new book from Garry Wills, What The Qur"an Meant, coming fall 2017.<br/><br/>Pulitzer Prize winner Garry Wills brings the same fresh scholarship, lively prose, and critical appreciation that characterize his well-known books on religion and American history to this outstanding biography of one of the most influential Christian philosophers.<br/><br/>Saint Augustine follows its subject from his youth in fourth-century Africa to his conversion and subsequent development as a theologian. It challenges the widely held misconceptions about Augustine’s sexual excesses and shows how, in embracing classical philosophy, Augustine managed to enlist “pagan authors” in the defense of Christianity. The result is a biography that makes a spiritual ancestor feel like our contemporary.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/85/9780143035985.jpg", "title_long": "Saint Augustine: A Life (Penguin Lives Biographies)", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.1 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.29982867632 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.44}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.29982867632}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.1}}, "pages": 176, "date_published": "2005-08-30", "subjects": ["Christian Books & Bibles', 'Churches & Church Leadership', 'Church History', 'History', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Philosophers', 'World', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies', 'Philosophy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Garry Wills'], 'title": "Saint Augustine: A Life (Penguin Lives Biographies)", "isbn13": "9780143035985", "msrp": 15, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0143035983", "isbn10": "0143035983"}}
