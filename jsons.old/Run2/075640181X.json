{"book": {"publisher": "DAW", "synopsis": "This standalone portal fantasy transports unsuccessful rockstar Theo Vilmos from modern California to a land of magic and mystery.<br/><br/>Returning to the fantasy genre that made him a coast-to-coast best-selling phenomenon, Tad Williams writes this stand-alone contemporary fantasy novel, set in Northern California—and also in the strange parallel world that coexists in the farthest reaches of the imagination.<br/>Theo Vilmos is a thirty-year-old lead singer in a not terribly successful rock band. Once, he had enormous, almost magical charisma, both onstage and off—but now, life has taken its toll on Theo.<br/><br/>Hitting an all-time low, he seeks refuge in a isolated cabin in the woods. While there, he reads an odd memoir written by a dead relative who believed he had visited the magical world of Faerie. And before Theo can disregard the account as the writings of a madman, he, too, is drawn to a place beyond his wildest dreams...a place that will be, and has always been, his destiny.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/18/9780756401818.jpg", "title_long": "The War of the Flowers", "dimensions": "Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.8438 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 4.2}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.75}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.8438}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.75}}, "pages": 832, "date_published": "2004-05-04", "subjects": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors": ["Tad Williams'], 'title": "The War of the Flowers", "isbn13": "9780756401818", "msrp": 8.99, "binding": "Mass Market Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101657642"}, "isbn": "075640181X", "isbn10": "075640181X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101657645", "binding": "print"}]}}
