{"book": {"publisher": "Penguin Books", "synopsis": "Meet Ella Turner and Isabelle du Moulin—two women born centuries apart, yet bound by a fateful family legacy. When Ella and her husband move to a small town in France, Ella hopes to brush up on her French, qualify to practice as a midwife, and start a family of her own. Village life turns out to be less idyllic than she expected, however, and a peculiar dream of the color blue propels her on a quest to uncover her family’s French ancestry. As the novel unfolds—alternating between Ella’s story and that of Isabelle du Moulin four hundred years earlier—a common thread emerges that unexpectedly links the two women. Part detective story, part historical fiction, The Virgin Blue is a novel of passion and intrigue that compels readers to the very last page.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/49/9780452284449.jpg", "title_long": "The Virgin Blue: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.7 Inches, Length: 5.1 inches, Weight: 0.69 Pounds, Width: 0.85 inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.1}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.85}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.69}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.7}}, "pages": 320, "date_published": "2003-06-24", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Metaphysical & Visionary', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Tracy Chevalier'], 'title": "The Virgin Blue: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780452284449", "msrp": 17, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "1101174404", "ePub": "1101174404"}, "isbn": "0452284449", "isbn10": "0452284449", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101174401", "binding": "print"}]}}
