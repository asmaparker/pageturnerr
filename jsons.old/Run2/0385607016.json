{"book": {"publisher": "Transworld Publishers Ltd", "synopsis": "Joanne Harris\" bestselling novels, "Chocolat", 'Blackberry Wine' and 'Five-Quarters of the Orange', are affectionately known as her culinary trilogy. In them, Joanne Harris whets our appetites with some tantalisingly delicious recipes taken from her own grandmere\'s recipe book. For, like Framboise, the heroine of 'Five-Quarters of the Orange', Joanne has family recipes which have been passed down through the generations and which she shares with us now in a mouth-watering celebration of French cuisine. From pumkin soup to Moules Mariniere, from Tarte aux cassis to Fouace Aveyronnaise (Grandmother\'s festival loaf), and taking in salads, starters, fish, poultry and plenty more along the way, these are simple and stylish recipes from the heart of the French family kitchen. Illustrated with stunning integrated photographs and complemented by anecdotes from her family, past and present, 'The French Kitchen' will be a must-have cookbook for all lovers of food and France.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/18/9780385607018.jpg", "title_long": "TheFrench Kitchen A Cookbook by Warde, Fran ( Author ) ON Nov-03-2003, Paperback", "dimensions": "Height: 9.68502 Inches, Length: 7.44093 Inches, Weight: 1.82542752936 Pounds, Width: 0.62992 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.44093}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.62992}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.82542752936}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.68502}}, "pages": 240, "date_published": "2003", "subjects": ["Cookbooks, Food & Wine'], 'authors": ['Fran Warde'], 'title": "TheFrench Kitchen A Cookbook by Warde, Fran ( Author ) ON Nov-03-2003, Paperback", "isbn13": "9780385607018", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0385607016", "isbn10": "0385607016"}}
