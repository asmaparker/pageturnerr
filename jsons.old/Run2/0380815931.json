{"book": {"publisher": "William Morrow Paperbacks", "synopsis": "This is "the Word" -- one man\"s word, certainly -- about the art (and artifice) of the state of our computer-centric existence. And considering that the 'one man' is Neal Stephenson, 'the hacker Hemingway' (Newsweek) -- acclaimed novelist, pragmatist, seer, nerd-friendly philosopher, and nationally bestselling author of groundbreaking literary works (Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon, etc., etc.) -- the word is well worth hearing. Mostly well-reasoned examination and partial rant, Stephenson\'s In the Beginning... was the Command Line is a thoughtful, irreverent, hilarious treatise on the cyber-culture past and present; on operating system tyrannies and downloaded popular revolutions; on the Internet, Disney World, Big Bangs, not to mention the meaning of life itself.', 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/37/9780380815937.jpg", "title_long": "In the Beginning...was the Command Line", "edition": "First Paperback Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.54895103238 Pounds, Width: 0.36 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.25}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.36}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.54895103238}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8}}, "pages": 160, "date_published": "1999-11-09", "subjects": ["Computers & Technology', 'Operating Systems', 'Linux', 'Unix', 'Software', 'Spreadsheets', 'History & Culture'], 'authors": ["Neal Stephenson'], 'title": "In the Beginning...was the Command Line", "isbn13": "9780380815937", "msrp": 12.99, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0061832901", "eBook": "0061832901", "ePub": "0061832901"}, "isbn": "0380815931", "isbn10": "0380815931", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061832901", "binding": "ebook"}]}}
