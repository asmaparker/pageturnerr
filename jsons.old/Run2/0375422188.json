Once again we are transported to Gaborone, capital city of Botswana, and into the world of Mma Ramotswe and her friends.<br/><br/>THE NO. 1 LADIES’ DETECTIVE AGENCY.<br/>FOR ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS AND ENQUIRIES. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED FOR ALL PARTIES.<br/>UNDER PERSONAL MANAGEMENT.<br/><br/>Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni are still engaged, but with no immediate plans to get married. Mma Ramotswe wonders when a wedding date will be named, but she is anxious to avoid putting pressure on her fiancé. For indeed he has other things on his mind -- particularly a frightening request (involving a parachute jump) made by Mma Potokwani, the persuasive matron of the orphan farm.<br/><br/>Mma Ramotswe herself has weighty matters on her mind. She has been approached by a wealthy lady to check up on several suitors. Are these men interested in her or just her money? This may be difficult to find out, but it’s just the kind of case Mma Ramotswe likes and she is, as we know, a very intuitive lady.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mma Makutsi -- plucky assistant detective and deputy manager of the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors garage -- is moving. Her entrepreneurial venture, the Kalahari Typing School for Men, is thriving and with this new income she has rented two rooms in a house. Her spare time is occupied with planning the move, the décor and her new life in a house with running water all to herself.<br/><br/>In the background of all this is Botswana, a country of empty spaces and echoing skies, a country so beautiful and entrancing that it breaks your heart. Mma Ramotswe has prepared the bush tea and is waiting for us to join her.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/88/9780375422188.jpg", "title_long": "The Full Cupboard of Life (No. 1 Ladies" Detective Agency, Book 5)", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 8.55 Inches, Length: 5.73 Inches, Weight: 0.85 pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.73}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.89}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.85}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.55}}, "pages": 202, "date_published": "2004-04-20", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Women's Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Alexander McCall Smith'], 'title": "The Full Cupboard of Life (No. 1 Ladies" Detective Agency, Book 5)", 'isbn13": "9780375422188", "msrp": "0.00", "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"Kindle Edition": "0375423249", "ePub": "0375423249"}, "isbn": "0375422188", "isbn10": "0375422188", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780375423246", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
