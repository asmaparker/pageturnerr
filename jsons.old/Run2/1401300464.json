{"book": {"publisher": "Hachette Books", "synopsis": "Alexandra Robbins wanted to find out if the stereotypes about sorority girls were actually true, so she spent a year with a group of girls in a typical sorority. The sordid behavior of sorority girls exceeded her worst expectations -- drugs, psychological abuse, extreme promiscuity, racism, violence, and rampant eating disorders are just a few of the problems. But even more surprising was the fact that these abuses were inflicted and endured by intelligent, successful, and attractive women. Why is the desire to belong to a sorority so powerful that women are willing to engage in this type of behavior -- especially when the women involved are supposed to be considered "sisters"? What definition of sisterhood do many women embrace? Pledged combines a sharp-eyed narrative with extensive reporting and the fly-on-the-wall voyeurism of reality shows to provide the answer.", 'language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/63/9781401300463.jpg", "title_long": "Pledged: The Secret Life of Sororities", "edition": "First Edition", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 1.34 Pounds, Width: 0 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.125}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.34}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 380, "date_published": "2004", "subjects": ["Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture', 'Women's Studies', 'Education & Teaching', 'Higher & Continuing Education', 'College Guides', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Student Life'], 'authors": ["Alexandra Robbins'], 'title": "Pledged: The Secret Life of Sororities", "isbn13": "9781401300463", "msrp": 23.95, "binding": "Hardcover", "related": {"ePub": "1401304052"}, "isbn": "1401300464", "isbn10": "1401300464", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781401304058", "binding": "print"}]}}
