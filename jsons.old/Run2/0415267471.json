{"book": {"publisher": "Routledge", "synopsis": "Solomon, the legend goes, had a magic ring which enabled him to speak to the animals in their own language. Konrad Lorenz was gifted with a similar power of understanding the animal world. He was that rare beast, a brilliant scientist who could write (and indeed draw) beautifully. He did more than any other person to establish and popularize the study of how animals behave, receiving a Nobel Prize for his work. King Solomon"s Ring, the book which brought him worldwide recognition, is a delightful treasury of observations and insights into the lives of all sorts of creatures, from jackdaws and water-shrews to dogs, cats and even wolves. Charmingly illustrated by Lorenz himself, this book is a wonderfully written introduction to the world of our furred and feathered friends, a world which often provides an uncanny resemblance to our own. A must for any animal-lover!", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/72/9780415267472.jpg", "title_long": "King Solomon"s Ring (Routledge Classics)", 'edition": "2", "dimensions": "Height: 7.79 Inches, Length: 5.08 Inches, Weight: 0.51588169308 Pounds, Width: 0.51 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.08}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.51}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.51588169308}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.79}}, "pages": 224, "date_published": "2002-05-09", "subjects": ["Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Zoology', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Fauna', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'General', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Modern', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["Konrad Lorenz'], 'title": "King Solomon"s Ring (Routledge Classics)", 'isbn13": "9780415267472", "msrp": 23.95, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1134498926"}, "isbn": "0415267471", "isbn10": "0415267471", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781134498925", "binding": "print"}]}}
