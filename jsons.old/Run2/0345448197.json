{"book": {"publisher": "Random House Trade Paperbacks", "synopsis": "It’s the boom years of the 1980s, and life is closing in on Nathan Seltzer, who rarely travels beyond his suddenly gentrifying Lower East Side neighborhood in New York City. Between paralyzing bouts of claustrophobia, Nathan wonders whether he should cheat on his wife with Karoline, a German pastry maker whose parents may or may not have been Nazis. His father, Harry, is plotting with the 1960s boogaloo star Chow Mein Vega for the comeback of this dance craze. Meanwhile, a homicidal drug addict is terrorizing the neighborhood.<br/>With its cast of unforgettable characters, Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue is a comedy of cultures, of the old and the new. It’s about struggling to hold on to life in a rapidly changing world, about food and sex, and about how our lives are shaped by love and guilt.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/94/9780345448194.jpg", "title_long": "Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue: A Novel of Pastry, Guilt and Music", "edition": "ARC - Uncorrected Proof", "dimensions": "Height: 7.94 Inches, Length: 5.28 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.28}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.79}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.55}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.94}}, "pages": 336, "date_published": "2006-02-28", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary'], 'authors": ["Mark Kurlansky'], 'title": "Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue: A Novel of Pastry, Guilt and Music", "isbn13": "9780345448194", "msrp": 13.95, 'binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0345448197", "isbn10": "0345448197"}}
