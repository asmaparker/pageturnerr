Frenzied by their terrible experiences with Wehrmacht and SS brutality, they wreaked havoc—tanks crushing refugee columns, mass rape, pillage, and unimaginable destruction. Hundreds of thousands of women and children froze to death or were massacred; more than seven million fled westward from the fury of the Red Army. It was the most terrifying example of fire and sword ever known.<br/><br/>Antony Beevor, renowned author of D-Day and The Battle of Arnhem, has reconstructed the experiences of those millions caught up in the nightmare of the Third Reich\"s final collapse. The Fall of Berlin is a terrible story of pride, stupidity, fanaticism, revenge, and savagery, yet it is also one of astonishing endurance, self-sacrifice, and survival against all odds.', 'language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/28/03/9780142002803.jpg", "title_long": "The Fall of Berlin 1945", "edition": "Reissue", "dimensions": "Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.5}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1.2}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.15}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 8.4}}, "pages": 544, "date_published": "2003-04-29", "subjects": ["History', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'Great Britain', 'Military', 'World War II', 'World'], 'authors": ["Antony Beevor'], 'title": "The Fall of Berlin 1945", "isbn13": "9780142002803", "msrp": 20, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1101175281"}, "isbn": "0142002801", "isbn10": "0142002801", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781101175286", "binding": "print"}]}}
