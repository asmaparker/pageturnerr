{"book": {"publisher": "Vintage", "synopsis": "From the New York Times bestselling author of Swing Time and one of the most revered writers of her generation comes an "intelligent ... exquisitely clever [novel] about fame, mortality, and the triumph of image over reality” (The Boston Globe).<br/><br/>Alex-Li Tandem sells autographs. His business is to hunt for names on paper, collect them, sell them, and occasionally fake them—all to give the people what they want: a little piece of Fame. But what does Alex want? Only the return of his father, the end of religion, something for his headache, three different girls, infinite grace, and the rare autograph of forties movie actress Kitty Alexander. With fries.<br/><br/>The Autograph Man is a deeply funny existential tour around the hollow trappings of modernity: celebrity, cinema, and the ugly triumph of symbol over experience. It offers further proof that Zadie Smith is one of the most staggeringly talented writers of her generation.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/74/9780375703874.jpg", "title_long": "The Autograph Man", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.22 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 5.22}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.78}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.65}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.97}}, "pages": 368, "date_published": "2003-06-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors": ["Zadie Smith'], 'title": "The Autograph Man", "isbn13": "9780375703874", "msrp": 14.55, "binding": "Paperback", "related": {"ePub": "1400034434"}, "isbn": "037570387X", "isbn10": "037570387X", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9781400034437", "binding": "printisbn"}]}}
