This edition has been updated to include information on new technological developments and their related vocabulary. A useful guide both for the deaf and for those who teach or otherwise work among deaf men and women, this book opens with a detailed presentation of the 10 key grammatical rules of ASL. Also emphasized is the use of “facial grammar” as an important supplement to manual signing. Most of this book’s contents are devoted to demonstrating and explaining signing. More than 800 line drawings clearly illustrate different words and then show how to combine them to convey statements. Here is easy access to the use of American Sign Language, a practical book for both the deaf and for those with normal hearing who have occasion to communicate with the deaf.", "language": "en", "image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/89/9780764134289.jpg", "title_long": "American Sign Language The Easy Way", "edition": "2nd", "dimensions": "Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {"length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 7.75}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 1}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 1.00089866948}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 10.75}}, "pages": 480, "date_published": "2006-11-01", "subjects": ["Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Instruction', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Sign Language', 'Medical Books', 'Allied Health Professions', 'Audiology & Speech Pathology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors": ["David A.
