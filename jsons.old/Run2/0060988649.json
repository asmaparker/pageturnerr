{"book": {"publisher": "William Morrow Paperbacks", "synopsis": "“A brilliant, perceptive, and deeply moving fable.”<br/>—Boston Sunday Globe<br/><br/>Publishers Weekly calls Gregory Maguire’s Lost “a deftly written, compulsively readable modern-day ghost story.” Brilliantly weaving together the literary threads of J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan, Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, and the Jack the Ripper stories,the bestselling author of The Wicked Years canon creates a captivating fairy tale for the modern world. With Lost, Maguire—who re-imagined a darker, more dangerous Oz, and inspired the creation of the Tony Award-winning Broadway blockbuster Wicked—delivers a haunting tale of shadows and phantoms and things going bump in the night, confirming his reputation as “one of contemporary fiction’s most assured myth-makers” (Kirkus Reviews).", "language": "en", "image": "https: //images.isbndb.com/covers/86/47/9780060988647.jpg", "title_long": "Lost: A Novel", "edition": "Reprint", "dimensions": "Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.88625829324 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches", "dimensions_structured": {'length": {"unit": "inches", "value": 6.12}, "width": {"unit": "inches", "value": 0.88}, "weight": {"unit": "pounds", "value": 0.88625829324}, "height": {"unit": "inches", "value": 9.25}}, "pages": 352, "date_published": "2002-09-17", "subjects": ["Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Historical', 'Supernatural', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic'], 'authors": ["Gregory Maguire'], 'title": "Lost: A Novel", "isbn13": "9780060988647", "msrp": 16.99, "binding": "Paperback", "isbn": "0060988649", "isbn10": "0060988649", "other_isbns": [{'isbn": "9780061748660", "binding": "print"}]}}
