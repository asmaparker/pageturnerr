{'book': {'publisher': 'Pearson College Div', 'synopsis': 'Offers a concise and thorough presentation of engineering mechanics theory and application. The material is reinforced with numerous examples to illustrate principles and imaginative, well-illustrated problems of varying degrees of difficulty. The book is committed to developing users\' problem-solving skills. Features new "Photorealistc" figures (approximately 200) that have been rendered in often 3D photo quality detail to appeal to visual learners. Features a large variety of problem types from a broad range of engineering disciplines, stressing practical, realistic situations encountered in professional practice, varying levels of difficulty, and problems that involve solution by computer. A thorough presentation of engineering mechanics theory and applications includes some of these topics: Kinematics of a Particle; Kinetics of a Particle: Force and Acceleration; Kinetics of a Particle: Work and Energy; Kinetics of a Particle: Impulse and Momentum; Planar Kinematics of a Rigid Body; Planar Kinetics of a Rigid Body: Force and Acceleration; Planar Kinetics of a Rigid Body: Work and Energy; Planar Kinetics of a Rigid Body: Impulse and Momentum; Three-Dimensional Kinematics of a Rigid Body; Three-Dimensional Kinetics of a Rigid Body; and Vibrations. For professionals in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, aeronautical engineering, and engineering mechanics careers.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/75/9780131046375.jpg', 'title_long': 'Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics', 'edition': '10', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 3.5 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 704, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Civil & Environmental', 'Mechanical', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['R.
