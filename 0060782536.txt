{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Voyager', 'synopsis': "A riveting fantasy debut about an unlikely deposed prince who must reclaim his kingdom, in the epic tradition of bestselling authors Mercedes Lackey and Elizabeth Haydon.<br/>When his uncle murders his family to take over the kingdom, Prince Kattanan duRhys is the only one of royal blood left alive...at a terrible cost. Mutilated, he can neither longer claim his throne, nor sire heirs to reign against the tyrannous new ruler. Trained as a harmless singer, Kattanan falls into an impossible, secret love with the Princess Melisande. But her jealous fiancé has his own nefarious plans, including a dark conspiracy with Kattanan's traitor...and a sinister magic that could destroy the kingdom. Banished, betrayed, rescued and revealed, Kattanan becomes the focal point of his grandmother's obsessive plot to depose his uncle. But can he gain the throne? And at what price?<br/>With the help of a disgraced prince, a female wizard, a powerful magic–breaker, a fiancé he doesn't want, and the man in love with her, Kattanan finds an unorthodox way to reclaim his kingdom and win the heart of his love. Well–realized characters, lush storytelling, and riveting intrigue make The Singer's Crown a remarkable debut from an author with a strong new voice.<br/>Wonderful epic fantasy: This is very commercial, very well–written court intrigue fantasy by a great new voice which takes beloved fantasy elements – a deposed prince, court intrigue, sinister magic, and a dashing adventure – and gives them its own new spin. These same elements have made Robin Hobb, Mercedes Lackey, and Sara Douglas extremely successful, popular authors.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/35/9780060782535.jpg', 'title_long': "The Singer's Crown", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 480, 'date_published': '2005-10-11', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic'], 'authors': ['Elaine Isaak'], 'title': "The Singer's Crown", 'isbn13': '9780060782535', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060782536', 'isbn10': '0060782536'}}
