{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Just as digital technology transformed our world faster and in ways that would have been unimaginable mere decades ago, genetic science is about to radically alter our lives -- and in ways perhaps even more dramatic and profound. Sooner than you can imagine, human beings will be capable of diagnosing their own illnesses, designating the sex of their children, even designing the food they eat -- all as easily as using a cell phone. The genetic revolution has arrived, the genome has been mapped, and much of the technology is available now. Now is the time for every one of us to take control of our DNA, and one man is uniquely qualified to show us how: Glenn McGee, pioneer in the study of "home genetics" and wunderkind of the exciting world found at the nexus of life science, bioethics, and computer technology.<br/>One of the most respected authorities in the field of genomics -- the study of the genetic "software" inside plants, animals, and us -- McGee takes us on an eye-opening journey behind the headlines and into the heart of this formidable cutting-edge science, revolutionizing the global debate about genetics with an energy and a plan that are certain to surprise, delight, and amaze fellow experts and laypersons alike. McGee has written the first user\'s guide to genomics, outlining the ways in which ordinary people will soon be using genetic information in radically new ways at home, at work, and at leisure.<br/>Probing the far-ranging ethical and legal implications of genomic research, McGee tackles its most controversial and hotly debated aspects -- from patenting your DNA to genetic engineering at the supermarket -- and explodes unnecessary fears about this wondrous new knowledge. In fact, most readers of this book will no doubt find themselves making life-changing decisions about everything from insurance policies to hobbies to school selection to groceries.<br/>We live in a brave new world. Beyond Genetics is a clear, accessible, reassuring guide to the real-life choices every one of us faces, and it provides us with the knowledge we need to take the right steps forward into tomorrow ... and beyond.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/00/9780060008000.jpg', 'title_long': 'Beyond Genetics: Putting the Power of DNA to Work in Your Life', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.625 inches, Weight: 0.933125 Pounds, Width: 0.909341 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.625}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.909341}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.933125}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2003-09-30', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Business & Money', 'Science & Math', 'Evolution'], 'authors': ['Glenn McGee'], 'title': 'Beyond Genetics: Putting the Power of DNA to Work in Your Life', 'isbn13': '9780060008000', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060008008', 'isbn10': '0060008008', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061842320', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
