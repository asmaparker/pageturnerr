{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "An indecent proposal<br/>Abigail Shaw is a proper young lady, hardly the sort to boldly offer a deal to London's most distinguished and perfect duke. But Abigail, desperate to save her father's newspaper business, is after a good scandal. She'd have the sensational headlines that would keep the ton talking—and the family business thriving—if only she could uncover the secrets of Christopher Cabot, the Duke of Madingley. What better way than a pretend romance? Yet, with all his seductive glances and stolen caresses, she somehow has to keep from succumbing to temptation.<br/>Christopher finds Abigail—and her proposal—intriguing. A fake romance with the stunning commoner would allow him time to choose a suitable wife from among the would-be duchesses nipping at his heels. It seems like a perfect plan . . . as long as he can keep her from uncovering his one deep, dark secret. But as he falls for the cunning beauty, he will be tempted to reveal all—his secret, his heart, and his soul.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/61/9780061235061.jpg', 'title_long': 'Never Dare a Duke (Sons of Scandal)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.41005980732 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41005980732}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-11-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Gayle Callen'], 'title': 'Never Dare a Duke (Sons of Scandal)', 'isbn13': '9780061235061', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061980102'}, 'isbn': '0061235067', 'isbn10': '0061235067', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061980107', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
