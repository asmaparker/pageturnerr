Women, she states with her trademark frankness, need to wise up, stop subjugating who they are, and stop making stupid decisions in the name of love. They hide their talents and opinions so they won't offend. They tiptoe through life letting others take credit for their ideas because they would rather be liked than respected. They spend their lives trying to please everyone but them-selves, and then they wonder why they feel so frustrated and unfulfilled.<br/>Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever presents Judge Judy's ten hard and true lessons for happiness:<br/>Beauty fades, dumb is forever.<br/>Don't crawl when you can fly.<br/>What goes up must come down.<br/>Denial is a river in Egypt.<br/>Master the game--then play it.<br/>You're the trunk of the tree.<br/>You can't teach the bull to dance.<br/>Failure doesn't build character.<br/>Letting go is half the fun.<br/>You can be the hero of your own story.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/16/9780060929916.jpg', 'title_long': 'Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever: The Making of a Happy Woman', 'edition': '1 HARPER', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.3747858454 Pounds, Width: 0.47 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.47}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3747858454}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 190, 'date_published': '2000-01-26', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Self-Esteem', 'Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Television Performers', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Lawyers & Judges', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Television', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling'], 'authors': ['Judy Sheindlin'], 'title': 'Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever: The Making of a Happy Woman', 'isbn13': '9780060929916', 'msrp': 9.94, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '006092991X', 'isbn10': '006092991X'}}
