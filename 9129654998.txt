{'book': {'publisher': 'R & S Books', 'synopsis': 'A little jester brings about big change When the world was a thousand years younger and minstrels traveled the roads, there was a monastery in the French countryside. The monks who lived there made books in which they painted lovely pictures. But the most beautiful picture, to them, was the painting of the weeping Madonna above the altar. One evening a jester boy comes to the monastery and is offered shelter. To thank the monks, he begins to juggle and dance. The stern Abbot wants to throw him out for disrespectful behavior, but soon the monks notice that something wonderful has happened. It is nothing less than a miracle, and one that will change the monastery \x96 and the weeping Madonna \x96 forever. Blending medieval and modern pictorial language, Helena Olofsson\x92s warmhearted story, accompanied by beautiful, distinctive illustrations, is about the transformative power of laughter and creativity.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/98/9789129654998.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Little Jester', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.5 Inches, Length: 8.75 Inches, Weight: 0.84 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.84}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.5}}, 'pages': 28, 'date_published': '2002-04-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction'], 'authors': ['Helena Olofsson', 'Kjersti Board'], 'title': 'The Little Jester', 'isbn13': '9789129654998', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '9129654998', 'isbn10': '9129654998'}}
