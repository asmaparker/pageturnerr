By showing couples how they can turn their worst sex and relationship disasters into personal growth and spiritual connection, Dr. Schnarch offers couples the best sex of their lives. In addition to taking an unflinchingly honest, realistic, and erotic approach to sex, Dr. Schnarch reveals the complicated emotional interactions hidden within couples' most private moments. Resurrecting Sex speaks of compassion, partnership, generosity, and integrity in adult sexual relationships, offering hope to millions of people who are struggling with sexual difficulties. Uplifting, provocative, and heartfelt, the book is organized into four sections: A crash course in sex Explanation of how sexual relationships really work Medical options and bionic solutions Vignettes of couples changing their sexual relationships Resurrecting Sex addresses all major sexual issues, including male erection problems such as rapid orgasm and delayed orgasm; women's problems with arousal and lubrication, difficulty reaching orgasm, and low desire; full coverage of Viagra (for both men and women); and other sex-enhancing drugs and medical options. Rather than dwelling on sexual techniques, this sympathetic book shows how to cure the rejection, hostility, and emotional alienation that often accompany sexual problems. Its unique method helps couples develop the love, affection, and commitment that prevent divorce and strengthen families.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/02/9780062030702.jpg', 'title_long': 'Resurrecting Sex: Solving Sexual Problems and Revolutionizing your Relationship', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'ePub', 'pages': 570, 'date_published': '2010', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Marriage', 'Sex', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Sexuality', "Women's Health", 'Pregnancy & Childbirth', 'Sexual Health', 'General', 'Kindle Store', 'Categories', 'Kindle eBooks'], 'authors': ['David Schnarch', 'James Maddock'], 'title': 'Resurrecting Sex: Solving Sexual Problems and Revolutionizing your Relationship', 'isbn13': '9780062030702', 'msrp': 13.59, 'binding': 'Kindle Edition', 'related': {'Paperback': '0060931787'}, 'isbn': '0062030701', 'isbn10': '0062030701', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780060931780', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
