No one, however, anticipates a murder. The guests of Abbot Robert Champeaux, former Knight Templar Sir Baldwin Furnshill and Simon Puttock, bailiff of Lydford, have been asked by their host to investigate the grisly discovery of a headless corpse by a local butcher. Hunting a killer in the din and bustle of the fair could prove a daunting task, especially with the victim's identity a mystery. But Sir Baldwin and Simon are determined to unravel the complex weave of intrigue, rage, and violence that has brought death to Tavistock -- even if it means courting their own destruction.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/65/9780060846565.jpg', 'title_long': "The Abbot's Gibbet: A Knights Templar Mystery", 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.435 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.435}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2006-04-25', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Michael Jecks'], 'title': "The Abbot's Gibbet: A Knights Templar Mystery", 'isbn13': '9780060846565', 'msrp': 7.5, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060846569', 'isbn10': '0060846569', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061835339', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
