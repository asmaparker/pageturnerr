{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Lady Maura O'Donnell swore to her father on his deathbed that she'd recover the Circle of Light, an enchanted Celtic relic that had brought the family prosperity—until it was stolen a century earlier by a notorious pirate. Now the pirate's descendant, the Duke of Gleneden, holds this rare treasure, and Maura would give anything to get it back . . .<br/>Alec McBride knows when he's been had. Lady Maura tricked him into marriage with the expertise of a born seductress, and now she'll pay for her treachery. He'll ravish her, tempt her, tame her—until she sorely wishes she'd never heard of the Duke of Gleneden. Caught up in their game of revenge, Alec and Maura never notice what is happening in their hearts—until it's too late.<br/>Their marriage may have been a farce, but there is nothing truer than their desire . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/00/9780060899400.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bride of a Wicked Scotsman', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2009-02-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Samantha James'], 'title': 'Bride of a Wicked Scotsman', 'isbn13': '9780060899400', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061972711'}, 'isbn': '0060899409', 'isbn10': '0060899409', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061972713', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
