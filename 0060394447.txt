{'book': {'publisher': 'Regan Books', 'synopsis': '"Until yesterday I\'d had a carefree existence. It was great. I had a laugh with Charlie, we went out, did drugs, had great sex, had a laugh, I saw Finn, I had a laugh. And now today, today, since the second I opened my eyes, the pair of them had turned into ogres of potential angst, pain, and -- oh no, the worst of all -- responsibility."<br/>Tommy is twenty-nine, lives and loves in London, and has a morbid fear of the c word -- commitment, the b word -- boyfriend, and the f word -- forgetting to call his drug dealer before the weekend. But when he begins to feel the urge to become a father, he starts to wonder if his chosen lifestyle can ever make him happy. His flatmates, the eccentric, maternal Sadie and the stoic, supportive Bobby, encourage Tommy to tone down his lifestyle a wee bit and accept the fact that he\'s got to grow up sometime. His boyfriend, Charlie (whose son, Finn, is the epitome of childhood charm), wishes that Tommy could make a real commitment to their relationship. But can he?<br/>Faced with the choice of maintaining his hedonistic, drugged-out, and admittedly fabulous existence or chucking it all in favor of a far more sensitive, fulfilling, and -- let\'s face its -- lightly staid lifestyle, Tommy finds himself in a true quandary. Through a series of adventures and misadventures that lead him from London nightspots to New York bedrooms and back, our boy Tommy manages to answer some of life\'s most pressing questions -- and even some he never thought to ask. Perfectly pitched, with scathing witticisms and deadpan observations, Tommy\'s Tale is a rollicking, tongue-in-cheek opus of absolute debauchery and reluctant redemption that\'s simply not to be missed.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/48/9780060394448.jpg', 'title_long': "Tommy's Tale", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.93}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 261, 'date_published': '2002-08', 'subjects': ['LGBTQ+ Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Biographical', 'Coming of Age', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Alan Cumming'], 'title': "Tommy's Tale", 'isbn13': '9780060394448', 'msrp': 12.44, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060394447', 'isbn10': '0060394447'}}
