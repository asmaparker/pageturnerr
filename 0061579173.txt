{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "She works to live . . .<br/>One would think the last place a beauty like Fallon O'Rourke could keep her virtue was in the Mayfair mansion of London's most licentious duke, the notorious Dominic Hale. Yet Fallon—who's endured nothing but lecherous advances since her father's tragic death—is perfectly safe there . . . disguised as a footman! Beneath the notice of the dark-haired devil with his smoldering blue eyes and sinful smile, Fallon never imagines her secret will be discovered. But how long can her deception last when she begins to wish she is one of the many women traipsing in and out of the sinful rogue's bedchamber?<br/>He lives to sin . . .<br/>Most men envy the duke, never suspecting his pleasure-loving ways are a desperate attempt to escape, however briefly, the pain of a past that's left him with a heart of stone. Only one woman can break down his defenses. Only one woman can win his love . . . if she reveals her secret and succumbs to the sins of the wicked duke.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/72/9780061579172.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sins of a Wicked Duke (The Penwich School for Virtuous Girls, 1)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.40565056208 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.40565056208}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2009-03-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Sophie Jordan'], 'title': 'Sins of a Wicked Duke (The Penwich School for Virtuous Girls, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061579172', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061971057'}, 'isbn': '0061579173', 'isbn10': '0061579173', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061971051', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
