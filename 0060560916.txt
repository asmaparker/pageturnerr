{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "The ultimate, behind–the–scenes look at the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, as he prosecutes the sprawling war on terror and emerges as a figure second only to the President in his ability to capture the country's attention and confidence.<br/>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has become the leading spokesman for the Bush administration on all matters related to the military and its prosecution of the war on terror. Midge Decter, an accomplished political jounalist who has enjoyed over two decades of personal friendship with Rumsfeld, will answer the question of why and how he has come to play such a critical role at this obviously critical moment. Partly biographical and partly analytical, the book will focus on Rumsfeld's past and current activities as well as what he represents: an ethos of sturdiness, frankness, and resilience that has clearly resonated with the American public in a post–Clinton wartime era. Decter has gained Rumsfeld's full cooperation, and she will trail him through the Pentagon and beyond as he prosecutes the war on terror, including any impending military campaign against Iraq. The daily stresses of advising the president, handling the media, crafting military policy, and dealing with issues of life and death will be examined from the inside––as it is happening.<br/>This book will offer a dynamic, intimate, behind–the–scenes look at the biggest political star (apart from the president himself) of the Bush administration.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/11/9780060560911.jpg', 'title_long': 'Rumsfeld: A Personal Portrait', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2003-10-14', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government'], 'authors': ['Midge Decter'], 'title': 'Rumsfeld: A Personal Portrait', 'isbn13': '9780060560911', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060560916', 'isbn10': '0060560916'}}
