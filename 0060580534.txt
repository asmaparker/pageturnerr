{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Peter Evans\'s biography of Aristotle Onassis, Ari, metwith great acclaim when it was published in 1986. Ariprovided the world with an unprecedented glimpse of theGreek shipping magnate\'s orbit of dizzying wealth, twistedintrigues, and questionable mores. Not long after the bookappeared, however, Onassis\'s daughter Christina and hislongtime business partner Yannis Georgakis hinted toEvans that he had missed the "real story" -- one that provedOnassis\'s intrigues had deadly results. "I must begin,"Georgakis said, "with the premise that, for Onassis, BobbyKennedy was unfinished business from way back..."<br/>His words launched Evans into the heart of a story thattightly bound Onassis not to Jackie\'s first husband, but tohis ambitious younger brother Bobby. A bitter rivalryemerged between Bobby and Ari long before Onassis andJackie had even met. Nemesis reveals the tangled thread ofevents that linked two of the world\'s most powerful men intheir intense hatred for one another and uncovers thesurprising role played by the woman they both loved. Theirpower struggle unfolds against a heady backdrop ofinternational intrigue: Bobby Kennedy\'s discovery of theGreek shipping magnate\'s shady dealings, which led him tobar Onassis from trade with the United States; Onassis\'sattempt to control much of Saudi Arabia\'s oil; Onassis\'suntimely love affair with Jackie\'s married sister LeeRadziwill; and his bold invitation to First Lady Jackie tojoin him on his yacht -- without the president. Just as theself-made Greek tycoon gloried in the chance to stir thewrath of the Kennedys, they struggled unsuccessfully tobreak his spell over the woman who held the key to all oftheir futures. After Jack\'s death, Bobby became ever closerto Camelot\'s holy widow, and fought to keep her frommarrying his sworn rival. But Onassis rarely failed to getwhat he wanted, and Jackie became his wife shortly afterBobby was killed.<br/>Through extensive interviews with the closest friends,lovers, and relatives of Onassis and the Kennedys, longtimejournalist Evans has uncovered the shocking culmination ofthe Kennedy-Onassis-Kennedy love triangle: AristotleOnassis was at the heart of the plot to kill Bobby Kennedy.Meticulously tracing Onassis\'s connections in the world ofterrorism, Nemesis presents compelling evidence that hefinanced the assassination -- including a startling confessionthat has gone unreported for nearly three decades. Alongthe way, this groundbreaking work also daringly paintsthese international icons in all of their true colors. FromEvans\'s deeply nuanced portraits of the charismatic Greekshipping magnate and his acquisitive iconic bride to hisprobing and revelatory look into the events that shaped anera, Nemesis is a work that will not be soon forgotten.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/37/9780060580537.jpg', 'title_long': 'Nemesis: The True Story of Aristotle Onassis, Jackie O, and the Love Triangle That Brought Down the Kennedys', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2004-06-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Rich & Famous', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'Americas'], 'authors': ['Peter Evans'], 'title': 'Nemesis: The True Story of Aristotle Onassis, Jackie O, and the Love Triangle That Brought Down the Kennedys', 'isbn13': '9780060580537', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060580534', 'isbn10': '0060580534'}}
