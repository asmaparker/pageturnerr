But when a string of ominous events -- including a mysterious fire that kills her great-aunt and a furor in the Western art world raised by a dozen Breck family paintings -- culminates in a threat to her life, Jill finally calls in a favor.<br/>Zach Balfour works part-time as a consultant for St. Kilda. Though he’s got the skills to be a highly effective bodyguard, being a bullet catcher isn't his preferred way to spend time. But Jill is in deeper waters than she’s ever known, and she’ll need his protection; as she soon discovers, the perils of running wild rivers are tame compared with the hidden dangers in the high-stakes game of art collecting. Together, Zach and Jill must race against time to unmask a ruthless killer hidden in the blue smoke of money, threats, lies, and death. . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/65/9780060829865.jpg', 'title_long': 'Party Images in the American Electorate', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.49824471212 pounds, Width: 0.31 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49824471212}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 122, 'date_published': '2008-12-14', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Elections & Political Process', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Mark D.
