So when she comes upon a young man who might be the solution to her predicament, she does not hesitate to act, though it means entering into a dangerous deceit and inviting a thief into her castle. The Thief<br/>All Gavin has known is a life of lawless poverty. Left for dead and taken in by a very young, very determined lady, he has little choice but to entertain her request. Posing as a squire, he begins to train the farmers and craftsmen of Haverleigh in the art of combat. In doing so, Gavin begins to know a far different life -- and to crave all it has to offer.<br/>As Haverleigh is secured through their labor and collusion, sparks fly between Gwyneth and her thief.
