{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Cookbooks', 'synopsis': 'My name is Ree. Some folks know me as "The Pioneer Woman."<br/>After years of living in Los Angeles, I made a pit stop in my hometown in Oklahoma on the way to a new, exciting life in Chicago. It was during my stay at home that I met Marlboro Man, a mysterious cowboy with steely blue eyes and a muscular, work-honed body. A strict vegetarian, I fell hard and fast, and before I knew it we were married and living on his ranch in the middle of nowhere, taking care of animals, and managing a brood of four young children. I had no idea how I\'d wound up there, but I knew it was exactly where I belonged.<br/>The Pioneer Woman Cooks is a homespun collection of photography, rural stories, and scrumptious recipes that have defined my experience in the country. I share many of the delicious cowboy-tested recipes I\'ve learned to make during my years as an accidental ranch wife\x97including Rib-Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce, Lasagna, Fried Chicken, Patsy\'s Blackberry Cobbler, and Cinnamon Rolls\x97not to mention several "cowgirl-friendly" dishes, such as Sherried Tomato Soup, Olive Cheese Bread, and CrÈme BrÛlÉe. I show my recipes in full color, step-by-step detail, so it\'s as easy as pie to follow along.<br/>You\'ll also find colorful images of rural life: cows, horses, country kids, and plenty of chaps-wearing cowboys.<br/>I hope you get a kick out of this book of mine. I hope it makes you smile. I hope the recipes bring you recognition, accolades, and marriage proposals. And I hope it encourages even the most harried urban cook to slow down, relish the joys of family, nature, and great food, and enjoy life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/98/9780061658198.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Recipes from an Accidental Country Girl', 'edition': 'Later Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.3 Inches, Length: 1 inches, Weight: 1.97975111276 Pounds, Width: 7.4 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.97975111276}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.3}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2009-10-27', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Quick & Easy', 'Regional & International', 'U.S. Regional', 'Celebrities & TV Shows', 'Comfort Food'], 'authors': ['Ree Drummond'], 'title': 'The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Recipes from an Accidental Country Girl', 'isbn13': '9780061658198', 'msrp': 16.49, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061959820'}, 'isbn': '0061658197', 'isbn10': '0061658197', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061959820', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
