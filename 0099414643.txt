{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House', 'synopsis': '"We thought we had lived through the terror of a nuclear war, but something far more ominous was brewing in the Soviet Union - a biological armageddon from which no one would escape. Dr. Alibek has emerged from the world\'s deadliest labs to tell a story that is as important as it is chilling. Sometimes the truth is far worse than fiction. No one can afford not to read this book" - Robin Cook, bestselling author of "Coma". "As the top scientist in the Soviet Union\'s biowarfare program and the inventor of the world\'s most powerful anthrax, Dr. Ken Alibek has stunned the highest levels of the U. S. Government with his revelations. Now, in a calm, compelling, utterly convincing voice, he tells the world what he knows. Modern biology is producing weapons that in killing power may exceed the hydrogen bomb. Ken Alibek describes them with the intimate knowledge of a top weaponeer" - Richard Preston, author of "The Hot Zone".', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/43/9780099414643.jpg', 'title_long': 'Biohazard', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 inches, Weight: 0.5401325419 Pounds, Width: 0.86614 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86614}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5401325419}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 330, 'date_published': '2000', 'subjects': ['History', 'Military', 'Weapons & Warfare', 'Russia', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Military Technology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Ken Alibek'], 'title': 'Biohazard', 'isbn13': '9780099414643', 'msrp': 28.75, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099414643', 'isbn10': '0099414643'}}
