When their marriage fails after eight years, Pete settles into the routine of court-sanctioned visits with his young son, Sam, a boy who has few physical similarities or common interest with Pete. When he discovers that Sam is not his biological son, Pete confronts Joan with the test results. She strikes back, cutting off visitations rights to keep Sam from finding out the truth.
