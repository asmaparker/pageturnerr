A pioneer of the thrash metal movement, Megadeath rose to international fame in the 1980s, and has gone on to earn seven consecutive Grammy nominations for Best Metal Performance.<br/>In this outrageously candid memoir, one of heavy metal’s most iconic figures gives an insider’s look into the loud and sordid world of thrash metal—sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll included.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/75/9780061714375.jpg', 'title_long': 'Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2010-08-03', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Instruments', 'Musical Genres', 'Songbooks', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Composers & Musicians', 'Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Dave Mustaine', 'Joe Layden'], 'title': 'Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir', 'isbn13': '9780061714375', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061714372', 'isbn10': '0061714372', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061997037', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
