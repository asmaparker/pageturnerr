{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins Publishers Ltd', 'synopsis': 'The beast is alive and prowling the high seas. As extremist Islamic pirates, armed and supported by a powerful Saudi terrorist, prey on civilian vessels in the Gulf of Aden, America aggressively answers with serious muscle -- a next-generation littoral warship with a full range of automated weapons systems that the enemy has dubbed "Satan\'s Tail." However, unforeseen technological problems combined with the suicidal tendencies of a fanatical foe mean support is needed from above -- and a pair of Dreamland\'s awesome Megafortresses and their Flighthawk escorts are dispatched to the war zone. But bitter professional rivalries threaten to damage, perhaps even destroy, the mission, as a vengeful opponent takes advantage of the disruption -- to strengthen his outlaw navy and set its sights horrifically high -- raising the stakes in a battle the U.S. and the world simply cannot afford to lose.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/61/9780007109661.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dreamland', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.37007 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.37007}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.440924524}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.00786}}, 'pages': 375, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Action & Adventure', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics'], 'authors': ['Dale Brown', 'Jim DeFelice'], 'title': 'Dreamland', 'isbn13': '9780007109661', 'msrp': 14.45, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0007109660', 'isbn10': '0007109660'}}
