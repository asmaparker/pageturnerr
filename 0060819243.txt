{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': "The easy–to–read bible for developing, financing, marketing, and selling consumer products––from gadgets to kitsch, from high–touch to high–end––for America's rising entrepreneurial nation.<br/>Launch It! How to Turn Good Ideas Into Great Products That Sell is written by a team of trend and product consultants with over 60 years of collective experience advising thousands of entrepreneurs, designers, and companies. As they realized not one trade book was available on the market that would provide soup–to–nuts guidance for any firm or entrepreneur seeking to turn inventions and cool ideas into great products that sell, they decided to write that book themselves. Unlike any other book, Launch It! provides the reader with the step–by–step game plan that anyone can follow to evaluate their idea, raise capital, save time, stay on top of emerging and important trends, and make money. While a handful of titles have been published addressing home inventors on one extreme and corporate R&D departments on the other, this is the book that reaches the widest possible audience.<br/>The book includes snappy sidebar profiles of winning entrepreneurs, and a resource guide of inside information and business and organizational contacts no other book can come close to matching.<br/>The product invention industry is one of the great entrepreneurial engines of the US economy, generating an audience of millions of buyers worldwide. It is also a broad gateway for everyday entrepreneurs with a product idea and a market niche. America is often considered the world's think tank when it comes to innovation in both hard and soft goods. Yet many great ideas often remain just that. They are often discarded by intelligent people who have the idea but the lack the resources or savvy to follow through. Launch It! is written for them––and for established companies looking for fresh ideas to help their businesses thrive, and inside intelligence on breaking through.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/48/9780060819248.jpg', 'title_long': 'Launch It!: How to Turn Good Ideas Into Great Products That Sell', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2005-09-06', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'International', 'Exports & Imports', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Marketing', 'Business Development & Entrepreneurship', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Small Business'], 'authors': ['Molly Miller-Davidson', 'JoAnne Stone-Geier', 'Michael B.
