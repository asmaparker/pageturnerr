{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Imagine infants free from painful diaper rash, new parenthood without thousands of dollars wasted in diapering costs, toilet training that is natural and noncoercive, and, most important, happier babies and parents<br/>As Christine Gross-Loh reveals in her progressive, enlightening book, all this is possible and more. Infants are born with the ability to communicate their need to "go," just as they communicate hunger or sleepiness. Gross-Loh, a mother of two children who were diaper-free at eighteen and fifteen months, uses the tenets of "elimination communication," or EC, to teach parents how to identify and respond to their baby or toddler\'s natural cues.<br/>Unlike the all-or-nothing approach of some parenting books, The Diaper-Free Baby addresses three categories of parents: full-time, part-time, and occasional EC\'ers. Parents can practice EC as much or as little as fits their family and lifestyle. A support group within a book, The Diaper-Free Baby also includes inspiring testimonials throughout every chapter. Parents who have successfully practiced EC identify common struggles, share experiences and problem-solving tips, and provide encouragement for those new to the technique. Their motivational stories together with Gross-Loh\'s practical advice will appeal to all parents interested in a fresh alternative to traditional toilet training.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/01/9780061229701.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Diaper-Free Baby: The Natural Toilet Training Alternative', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59965735264}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2007-01-02', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Early Childhood', 'Babysitting, Day Care & Child Care'], 'authors': ['Christine Gross-Loh'], 'title': 'The Diaper-Free Baby: The Natural Toilet Training Alternative', 'isbn13': '9780061229701', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061743267'}, 'isbn': '0061229709', 'isbn10': '0061229709', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061743269', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
