{'book': {'publisher': 'Quill', 'synopsis': "You really can eat more and weigh less -- if you know what to eat. As this groundbreaking book clearly shows, it's not just how much you eat, it's primarily what you eat.<br/>Most diets rely on small portion sizes to reduce calories sufficiently. You feel hungry and deprived. Dr. Ornish's program takes a new approach: abundance rather than deprivation. If you change the type of food, you don't have to be as concerned about the amount of food. You can eat whenever you're hungry , eat more food -- and still lose weight and keep it off. Simply. Safely. Easily. In this book, you'll find 250 gourmet recipes from the country's most celebrated chefs.<br/>Unlike high-protein diets that may mortage your well-being, Dr. Ornish's diet and lifestyle program is scientifically proven to help you lose weight and gain health. People not only keep off the weight, they lower their cholestoral and reduce their chances for getting heart disease and such other illnesses as breast, prostate, and colon cancer; diabetes; osteoporosis; and hypertension. Dr. Ornish's program has given millions of people new hope and new choices.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/79/9780060959579.jpg', 'title_long': 'Eat More, Weigh Less', 'edition': 'Revised, Updated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.73 Pounds, Width: 1.00901 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.86}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '1993', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Special Diet', 'Low Fat', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diets & Weight Loss', 'Weight Loss', 'Nutrition'], 'authors': ['Dean Ornish'], 'title': 'Eat More, Weigh Less', 'isbn13': '9780060959579', 'msrp': 14.46, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060959576', 'isbn10': '0060959576'}}
