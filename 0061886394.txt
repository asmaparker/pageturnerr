{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': '“Elena has left behind a story of resilience, hope and most of all, love. We can’t help but take her into our hearts, and carry the best of her into our own lives.”<br/>—Jeffrey Zaslow, coauthor of The Last Lecture<br/>Notes Left Behind by Brooke and Keith Desserich began as a journal they kept after their five-year-old daughter Elena was diagnosed with brain cancer and given just 165 days to live. As poignant and inspiring as Randy Pausch’s The Last Lecture, it is the story of the courage of a truly remarkable little girl who accomplished so much in so little time—and of her parents’ love and dedication to their child and their family. New York Times bestselling author James Patterson was profoundly moved by Elena’s beautiful life and Notes Left Behind, calling it, “a stunning story that teaches us how precious children, family, and life are, and that the sacrifices we make are worth it. I won’t forget the Desserich family, and neither will you.”', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/93/9780061886393.jpg', 'title_long': 'Notes Left Behind', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2009-10-27', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Happiness', 'Motivational', 'Personal Transformation', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Medical', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Brooke Desserich', 'Keith Desserich'], 'title': 'Notes Left Behind', 'isbn13': '9780061886393', 'msrp': 19.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061886394', 'isbn10': '0061886394'}}
