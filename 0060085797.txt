These very real results were achieved through learning management techniques that spell profitability for the organization and its employees - which is why many people hail it as the answer to Japan's Theory Z. The One Minute Manager is a concise, easily read story demonstrating three very practical management techniques. The story unfolds to reveal several studies in medicine and the behavioral sciences that explain clearly why these apparently simple methods work so well with so many people. By the book's end you will know how to apply them to your own situation. That's why One Minute Manager has become one of America's best-selling management books and a national sensation, featured in People magazine, and on the Today Show, The Merv Griffin Show, and other network television programs.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/97/9780060085797.jpg', 'title_long': 'One Minute Manager NR ed', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.535 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.53}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.535}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 111, 'date_published': '2001-10-25', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Business Culture', 'Motivation & Self-Improvement', 'Management & Leadership', 'Management', 'Motivational'], 'authors': ['Ken Blanchard', 'Spencer, M.D. Johnson'], 'title': 'One Minute Manager NR ed', 'isbn13': '9780060085797', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060085797', 'isbn10': '0060085797'}}
