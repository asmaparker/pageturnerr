{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Though her (biological) clock is furiously ticking away, entertainment publicity pro extraordinaire Emily Sanders didn\'t hear the starting bell. Hitting thirty and watching her best friends settle down, she too wants to have the life that once upon a time ... wished upon a star ... she dreamed she\'d have: the house, the kids, the perfect man. But in L.A., where image is everything, "where every beauty pageant winner is an eight in a sea of nines all wishing they were Julia Roberts," finding true love isn\'t easy. Especially when boyfriend material includes a beautiful young surfer god, an aging music executive, the boss\'s boss\'s boss, and a baseball player with two cell phones (one of which Emily doesn\'t have the number to).<br/>With her confidence heading due south like everything else on her body, Emily turns to a smart, sharp-eyed psychotherapist who helps her get past the "flutter, flutter," her old time-tested method for picking the wrong guy. Soon she finds herself able to spot "the reasons," the previously invisible flags of a destined-to-fail relationship, and narrow her focus to stop looking for Mr. Right and learn how to start looking out for Mr. Wrong.<br/>Emily\'s Reasons Why Not is for everyone who has ever wasted her time chasing down the wrong guy for the right reasons, wondering "why" and "when is it going to happen for me?" With the edge of an insider, but the heart of a dreamer, the disarming and unflappable Emily meshes her views on the entertainment industry she works in, the men she\'s dated, the therapy sessions she mulled over, and "the one" she knows is out there for every woman ... including herself.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/44/9780060594244.jpg', 'title_long': "Emily's Reasons Why Not: A Novel", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2004-07-06', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'United States'], 'authors': ['Carrie Gerlach'], 'title': "Emily's Reasons Why Not: A Novel", 'isbn13': '9780060594244', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060594241', 'isbn10': '0060594241'}}
