Colin Eversea, a handsome, reckless unapologetic rogue is sentenced to hang for murder and, inconveniently for him, the only witness to the crime disappears. Then again, throughout history, the Everseas have always managed to cheat fate in style: Colin is snatched from the gallows by a beautiful, clever mercenary.<br/>A captivating captor. . .<br/>Cool-headed, daring Madeleine Greenway is immune to Colin's vaunted charm. Her mission is not to rescue Colin but to kidnap him, and to be paid handsomely for it. But when it becomes clear that whoever wants Colin alive wants Madeline dead, the two become uneasy allies in a deadly race for truth. Together, they'll face great dangerâ€”and a passion neither can resist.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/88/9780061341588.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Perils of Pleasure (Pennyroyal Green Series)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4739938633 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4739938633}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-01-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Julie Anne Long'], 'title': 'The Perils of Pleasure (Pennyroyal Green Series)', 'isbn13': '9780061341588', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061749281'}, 'isbn': '0061341584', 'isbn10': '0061341584', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061749285', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
