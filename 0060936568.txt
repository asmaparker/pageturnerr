{'book': {'publisher': 'Hearst Books', 'synopsis': 'Designers make color choices that affect both the meaning and impact of their logo designs every day. They have to ask themselves: Is orange too forceful? Does red give the wrong impression? Will purple convey the right message? Questions like these can be put to rest with this ingenious, tell-all-about-color book. While many books address logo design in general, this is the only one that examines the psychology and use of color in terms of how it affects a design, and how that design affects a viewer. By exposing the underlying meaning of each hue, this book ensures that designers never again second-guess their color choices.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/63/9780060936563.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blue Is Hot, Red Is Cool: Choosing the Right Color for Your Logo', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.65 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 184, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Graphic Design', 'Commercial'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Blue Is Hot, Red Is Cool: Choosing the Right Color for Your Logo', 'isbn13': '9780060936563', 'msrp': 35, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060936568', 'isbn10': '0060936568'}}
