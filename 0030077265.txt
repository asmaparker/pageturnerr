{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt, Rinehart and Winston', 'synopsis': 'With a new epilogue<br/>Richly illustrated with houses large and small, old and new, with photographs, plans, and cutaway drawings, this is a book for people who want a house but who may not know what they really need, or what they have a right to expect.<br/>The authors establish the basis for good building by examining houses in the small Massachusetts town of Edgartown; in Santa Barbara, California, where a commitment was made to re-create an imaginary Spanish past; and in Sea Ranch, on the northern California coast, where the authors attempt to create a community. These examples demonstrate how individual houses can express the care, energies, and dreams of the people who live in them, and can contribute to a larger sense of place.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/65/9780030077265.jpg', 'title_long': 'The place of houses', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.85 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.85}}, 'pages': 278, 'date_published': '1974', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Architecture', 'Buildings'], 'authors': ['Charles Willard Moore', 'Gerald Allen', 'Donlyn Lyndon'], 'title': 'The place of houses', 'isbn13': '9780030077265', 'msrp': 44.92, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0030077265', 'isbn10': '0030077265'}}
