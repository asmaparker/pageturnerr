{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperEntertainment', 'synopsis': 'Valerie Harper has a message for women of a certain age: "Work those laugh lines!" With the irreverence and wit that made her one of television\'s most beloved personalities, Harper (a.k.a. Rhoda Morgenstern) takes on those phony "fabulous at 50" books written by women whose skin is free of laugh lines and who wouldn\'t know a cellulite pocket if it bit them on the backside. With her trademark shoot-from-the-hip, call-\'em-like-she-sees-\'em style, she helps women celebrate, with humor and grace, what it means to be middle aged.<br/>Harper\'s essays explore the treacherous terrain women must travel -- from the tyrannies of fashion to the unmentionables of menopause. She tackles the most perplexing questions of the day: If you wear a size zero, do you exist? Would menopause be revered if it happened to men? Do calories count if you eat standing up? Are dressing rooms fitted with fun house mirrors? Today I Am a Ma\'am is the perfect antidote to the youth obsession of our culture, offered by America\'s most reliable girlfriend. It is Humor Replacement Therapy for midlife women, a book you can pick up when ever you need a laugh or a reminder that midriff drift is not the end of the world.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/96/9780060199296.jpg', 'title_long': "Today I Am a Ma'am: and Other Musings On Life, Beauty, and Growing Older", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.63 Pounds, Width: 0.733516 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.733516}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Mid-Life', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Rich & Famous', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Aging', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Specific Demographics', "Women's Studies"], 'authors': ['Valerie Harper', 'Catherine Whitney'], 'title': "Today I Am a Ma'am: and Other Musings On Life, Beauty, and Growing Older", 'isbn13': '9780060199296', 'msrp': 22, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0062326341', 'ePub': '0062326341'}, 'isbn': '0060199296', 'isbn10': '0060199296', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062326348', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
