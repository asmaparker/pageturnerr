{'book': {'publisher': 'Balzer + Bray', 'synopsis': "Doug Lee is undead quite by accident—attacked by a desperate vampire, he finds himself cursed with being fat and fifteen forever. When he has no luck finding some goth chick with a vampire fetish, he resorts to sucking the blood of cows under cover of the night. But it's just not the same.<br/>Then he meets the new Indian exchange student and falls for her—hard. Yeah, he wants to bite her, but he also wants to prove himself to her. But like the laws of life, love, and high school, the laws of vampire existence are complicated—it's not as easy as studying Dracula. Especially when the star of Vampire Hunters is hot on your trail in an attempt to boost ratings. . . .<br/>Searing, hilarious, and always unexpected, Fat Vampire is a satirical tour de force from one of the most original writers of fiction today.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/05/9780061920905.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fat Vampire: A Never Coming of Age Story', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.93035074564 Pounds, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.93035074564}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2010-07-27', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humorous', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Horror'], 'authors': ['Adam Rex'], 'title': 'Fat Vampire: A Never Coming of Age Story', 'isbn13': '9780061920905', 'msrp': 13.05, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061920908', 'isbn10': '0061920908'}}
