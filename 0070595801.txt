{'book': {'publisher': 'Intl Marine Pub', 'synopsis': "This completely revised edition of the snyders' classic Knots and Lines Illustrated teaches the 20 most useful knots and slices with step-by-step sequential photographs. Each knot receives two facing pages, so the reader never has to flip a page to figure out where to tuck the rope end next, and the book features a lie-flat binding for easy use. The bowline, reefknot, sheetbend, clove hitch, and others are all here, of course, as well as such deliciously obscure gems as the carrick bend, the stevedore knot, and the rope-to-chain splice. In addition, full-color photos imbued with the romance of boating go beyond knots to demonstrate how to coil hallyards and sheets, make up gasket coils for stowage, handle dockline, heave a line, tow dinghies, and more. There is also a color gallery of knots in use on boats, making this book a pleasure to hold as well as to study.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/04/9780070595804.jpg', 'title_long': 'Nautical Knots and Lines Illustrated: The Essentials of Smart Line Handling, Knotting, and Splicing-In Color', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '1996-11-06', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Transportation', 'Ships'], 'authors': ['Paul Snyder', 'Arthur Snyder'], 'title': 'Nautical Knots and Lines Illustrated: The Essentials of Smart Line Handling, Knotting, and Splicing-In Color', 'isbn13': '9780070595804', 'msrp': 5.39, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0070595801', 'isbn10': '0070595801'}}
