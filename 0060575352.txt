Unbeknownst to her, the burglar she imitates is the man she's loved since she was twelve.<br/>To save a friend, Major Marcus Dunn, a war hero, is forced to return to the orphanage he swore never to revisit. Marcus must ferret out a traitor to the Crown. Instead, he winds up hunting a copycat criminal who somehow manages to mimic his youthful escapades as the notorious thief of Robinson Square. Little does he know that the quarry he hunts is the staid, blue–stocking lady living under his own roof.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/59/9780060575359.jpg', 'title_long': 'More Than a Scandal', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.42 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.42}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-06-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Sari Robins'], 'title': 'More Than a Scandal', 'isbn13': '9780060575359', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061916641'}, 'isbn': '0060575352', 'isbn10': '0060575352', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061916649', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
