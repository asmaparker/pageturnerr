{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'This sourcebook offers all the information you need to understand and design biomedical instruments. Biomedical Instruments contains extensive analysis of signal processing electronic design for medical instruments, in-depth descriptions of design methods for medical transducers, and an introduction to medical imaging and tomographic algorithms. Transducers covered include variable R, L, and C, piezoelectric, electrodynamic and magnetostrictive, force balance, and fiber optic. Operational amplifiers, analog filters, biotelemetry, discriminators, phase-locked loops, and microprocessors are covered in a comprehensive section on circuitry. Exercises and problems accompany each chapter of the text.<br/>This is the first paragraph of the preface...either the paragraph above, or this paragraph can be used for the blurb_<br/>From the Preface:<br/>The book aims at (a) presenting a physical explanation for the behavior of various transducer, (b) developing the mathematical theory applicable to these transducers, and (c) discussing the practical design of biomedical instruments. Our hope is that the book will serve as a text for biomedical engineering students who will be engaged in the design of instruments, as a reference book for medical instrument designers, and as a source of ideas for the large numbers of biomedical research workers who, at one time or another, must build a gadget to implement their research. Numerous examples of medical instrument design are presented in order to clarify the mathematical analyses. Brings the volume up-to-date with new material on microprocessor applications, fiber optic instruments, and modern imaging systems Explains behavior of transducers Develops mathematical theory for transducers Discusses the design of biomedical instruments Serves as a text for biomedical engineers or a reference for medical instrument designers Provides suitable homework problems at the end of each chapter', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/04/9780127441504.jpg', 'title_long': 'Biomedical Instruments: Theory and Design, First Edition', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.37347989226 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.37347989226}}, 'pages': 279, 'date_published': '1976-01', 'subjects': ['Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine', 'Reference', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Walter Welkowitz'], 'title': 'Biomedical Instruments: Theory and Design, First Edition', 'isbn13': '9780127441504', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0127441506', 'isbn10': '0127441506'}}
