{'book': {'publisher': 'Malthouse Pr', 'synopsis': "The Nobel Laureate's reputation as a dramatist tends to cloud his poetic achievement, and in modern African literature, poetry lives in the shadow of fiction. The criticism of Soyinka's poetry has so far centred on his themes of individuality and death, his imagery, and on the controversy over his authenticity, obscurity and difficulty. Here, in a new approach, an academic himself and one of the leading younger generation of African poets, discusses critically the voice and viewpoint of the poet with the object of establishing Soyinka's persona. The book covers the personality and world view of the man, as revealed in his poetry.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/67/9789780230067.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Poetry of Wole Soyinka', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.50926782522 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50926782522}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 140, 'date_published': '1994', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Poetry'], 'authors': ['Tanure Ojaide'], 'title': 'The Poetry of Wole Soyinka', 'isbn13': '9789780230067', 'msrp': 21.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9780230068', 'isbn10': '9780230068'}}
