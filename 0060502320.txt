{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Vanessa Tower has never done anything reckless in her life -- then again, she\'s never met anyone like Christopher "Crash" Dunmoor. The man spends his days jumping out of airplanes, canoeing down raging rivers, doing anything for a thrill -- and prim, proper, studious Vanessa doesn\'t need that sort of excitement. But the sexy adventurer can ignite sparks in her with just a smile, something Vanessa finds most troubling ... and impossible to ignore.<br/>A confirmed loner with no ties and painful secrets, Crash knows wild is the only way to live. Yet this straightlaced lady he\'s gotten involved with is turning out to be a bigger turn-on than adrenaline! It\'s crazy to think he could ever have anything in common with this gorgeous bookworm. So why is his heart telling him that holding her, touching her, and tasting her would be the most tantalizing adventure of all?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/24/9780060502324.jpg', 'title_long': "I've Got You, Babe", 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2002-11-05', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Karen Kendall'], 'title': "I've Got You, Babe", 'isbn13': '9780060502324', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060502320', 'isbn10': '0060502320'}}
