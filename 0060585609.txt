Sure, life as a fugitive on the Overseas Highway has been fun. But it’s been lonely too, especially now that he’s hit the beautiful Florida Keys. Serge wants a bride. And nothing will come between him and his soul mate ... when he finally hunts her down.<br/>On the road to finding Ms. Right, Serge will hook up with an astonishing array of scoundrels, schemers, and hoodlums, including an old accomplice he thought was long dead; a gaggle of irregular regulars at the No Name pub, a remote bar in the Keys’ back country; a drug kingpin with a penchant for solitude and brutality; and a notorious real estate swindler who sets Serge’s heart aflutter. And while the course of true love is never smooth, things soon go wildly out of control with a lovesick Serge hilariously leading the way.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/00/9780060585600.jpg', 'title_long': 'Torpedo Juice: A Novel (Serge Storms)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-01-18', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Humorous', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Private Investigators', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Tim Dorsey'], 'title': 'Torpedo Juice: A Novel (Serge Storms)', 'isbn13': '9780060585600', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060585609', 'isbn10': '0060585609'}}
