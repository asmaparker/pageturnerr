But his dream is about to be put on hold. Arriving at the stables late one night, Lincoln walks into a crisis. Thieves have viciously attacked the stable owners' daughter, leaving her unconscious. As she lies in a coma, what appears to be freak chance sets Lincoln on the trail of the attackers. Disregarding the advice of the police and the increasingly unpleasant warnings from those involved, he juggles sleuthing with a demanding job and competitive riding career. But, as the violence escalates, it becomes chillingly clear that someone is trying to kill him for reasons of their own—and the race is on to find out who, before they succeed.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/82/9780099463382.jpg', 'title_long': 'Deadfall', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.8 Inches, Length: 4.4 Inches, Weight: 0.61288508836 Pounds, Width: 1.27 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.27}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.61288508836}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.8}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2005-07-01', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Cozy', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Lyndon Stacey'], 'title': 'Deadfall', 'isbn13': '9780099463382', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099463385', 'isbn10': '0099463385'}}
