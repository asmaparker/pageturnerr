{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Ranked as one of the best diet plans by US News & World Report: A plan to lose weight that puts the focus on feeling sated and satisfied with fewer calories; author Barbara Rolls has earned the author the Obesity Society Presidential Medal of Distinction for her work in research and outreach.<br/>?Dieters everywhere have the same complaint: they\'re hungry all the time. Now this revolutionary book, based on sound scientific principles, can help you lose weight safely, effectively, and permanently without those gnawing pangs of hunger.<br/>The Volumetrics Weight-Control Plan introduces the concept of "energy density" -- concentration of calories in each portion of food. Here you\'ll learn how to avoid high energy -- dense foods, and how such different nutritional factors as fat, fiber, protein, and water affect energy density and satiety. You\'ll discover which foods, eaten under which circumstances, allow you to consume fewer calories and still be satisfied. And you\'ll get to know the hidden calorie traps, seemingly innocuous foods that can sneak unwanted calories into your body. Finally, the authors offer 60 sensible, tasty and easy recipes, plus an integrated program of exercise and behavior management that can be sustained over a lifetime.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/25/9780060932725.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Volumetrics Weight-Control Plan: Feel Full on Fewer Calories (Volumetrics series)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.76 Inches, Length: 8.02 Inches, Weight: 0.63713593718 Pounds, Width: 5.33 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.02}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.33}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63713593718}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2000-12-05', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Special Diet', 'Weight Loss', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diets & Weight Loss', 'Other Diets', 'Exercise & Fitness', 'Nutrition'], 'authors': ['Barbara J.
