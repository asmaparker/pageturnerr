{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': "A memoir of America's most turbulent, whimsical decade, in the words of the man who experienced it all...<br/>From the New York City of Kline and De Kooning to the jazz era of New Orleans's French Quarter to Ken Kesey's psychedelic California, Prime Green explores the 1960s in all its weird, innocent, fascinating glory. An account framed by two wars, it begins with Robert Stone's last year in the Navy, when he took part in an Antarctic expedition navigating the globe, and ends in Vietnam, where he was a correspondent in the days following the invasion of Laos. Told in scintillating detail, Prime Green zips from coast to coast, from days spent in the raucous offices of Manhattan tabloids to the breathtaking beaches of Mexico, and merry times aboard the bus with Kesey and the Pranksters.<br/>Building on personal vignettes from Stone's travels across America, this powerful memoir offers the legendary novelist's inside perspective on a time many understand only peripherally. These accounts of the 1960s are riveting not only because Stone is a master storyteller but because he was there, in the thick of it, through all the wild times. From these incredible experiences, Prime Green forges a moving and adventurous portrait of a unique moment in American history.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/69/9780060198169.jpg', 'title_long': 'Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.93}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2007-01-05', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural'], 'authors': ['Robert Stone'], 'title': 'Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties', 'isbn13': '9780060198169', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060198168', 'isbn10': '0060198168'}}
