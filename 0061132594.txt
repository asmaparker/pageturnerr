{'book': {'publisher': 'Smithsonian', 'synopsis': "Dog lovers do not need to be reminded that dogs are astonishing creatures, but recent research shows that they are even more amazing than anyone knew. Dogs draws on the last several decades of studies, examining everything from a dog's eyesight to its culinary preferences and sense of humor. Jake Page looks at dogs' wild brothers, the wolves, and their closer cousins, the wild or pariah dogs; explains the newest theory of how dogs were domesticated; describes a dog's development from puppyhood on; and finally ponders a dog's emotional life and intelligence.<br/>While not a practical book on dog training, Dogs will give readers a better sense of why their pets behave as they do. And as an added bonus, Jake Page's own pack of six dogs makes multiple cameo appearances.<br/>Engaging and informative, Dogs will make readers see man's best friend quite differently.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/99/9780061132599.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dogs: A Natural History', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.89}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2007-10-09', 'subjects': ['Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Dogs', 'Science & Math', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Natural History'], 'authors': ['Jake Page'], 'title': 'Dogs: A Natural History', 'isbn13': '9780061132599', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061132594', 'isbn10': '0061132594'}}
