{'book': {'publisher': 'Campfire', 'synopsis': "In three days the world will end...<br/><br/>Pembleton was the most boring place in the world until Count Dracula, Doctor Frankenstein, and a whole host of terrifying monsters moved in. They are under the leadership of an evil man known as Pierceblood. The only thing stopping Pierceblood, and his creatures of darkness, from destroying the world is the Dusk Society.<br/><br/>A secret organization created after World War I, the Dusk Society was formed to ensure that ancient, magical weapons do not fall into the wrong hands. Pierceblood is their greatest enemy, and they have waged a secret war against him for decades--battles have been fought in Paris Egypt, and London.<br/><br/>Now the conflict has come to small-town America and the fate of the world lies in the hands of the Dusk Society's newest recruits. But will they be able to overcome their differences, and combine their newly-discovered talents, to stop Pierceblood's evil plan?<br/><br/>The final battle will take place on Halloween.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/37/9789380028637.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Dusk Society: A Graphic Novel (Campfire Graphic Novels)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.24 Inches, Length: 6.53 Inches, Weight: 0.48281235378 Pounds, Width: 0.21 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.53}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.21}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48281235378}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.24}}, 'pages': 88, 'date_published': '2011-06-07', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Mystery', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Mysteries & Thrillers', 'Mystery & Detective'], 'authors': ['Mark Jones'], 'title': 'The Dusk Society: A Graphic Novel (Campfire Graphic Novels)', 'isbn13': '9789380028637', 'msrp': 11.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9380028636', 'isbn10': '9380028636'}}
