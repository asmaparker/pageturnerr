Louise's mother spends her mornings at the local elementary school with a group of women known as the Cheerleaders, who harass the school's first black student, six-year-old Ruby Bridges, as she enters the building. One day a Chevy Bel Air with a New York license plate pulls up, and out steps Morgan Miller, a man whose mysterious past is eclipsed by his intellect and open-manner\x97qualities that enchant mother and daughter alike. For the first time, Louise feels as if someone cares what she thinks, even if she doesn't know what she believes. But when the reason for Morgan's visit is called into question, everything Louise thinks she knows about her mother, her world, and herself will change.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/65/9780061148965.jpg', 'title_long': 'My Mother the Cheerleader', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2007-05-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Difficult Discussions', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Social & Family Issues', 'United States'], 'authors': ['Robert Sharenow'], 'title': 'My Mother the Cheerleader', 'isbn13': '9780061148965', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061148962', 'isbn10': '0061148962'}}
