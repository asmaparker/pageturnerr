{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Stephanie Klein was an eighth grader with a weight problem. It was a problem at school, where the boys called her "Moose," and it was a problem at home, where her father reminded her, "No one likes fat girls." After many frustrating sessions with a nutritionist known as the fat doctor of Roslyn Heights, Long Island, Klein\'s parents enrolled her for a summer at fat camp. Determined to return to school thin and popular, without her "lard arms" and "puckered ham," Stephanie embarked on a memorable journey that would shape more than just her body. It would shape her life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/98/9780060843298.jpg', 'title_long': 'Moose: A Memoir of Fat Camp', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2008-05-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diets & Weight Loss', 'Weight Loss', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Adolescent Psychology'], 'authors': ['Stephanie Klein'], 'title': 'Moose: A Memoir of Fat Camp', 'isbn13': '9780060843298', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060843292', 'isbn10': '0060843292'}}
