Author Dennis Wedlick looks at the work of three architects whose attention to detail and fine craftsmanship have gained them broad recognition. The architects featured include Peter Bohlin of the Pennsylvania-based firm of Bohlin Cwynski Jackson whose residential work can be found throughout the United States, Hugh Newell Jacobson, a Washington DC based architect known for his classical modern houses that have been featured in shelter magazines throughout the world, and Obie Bowman, a northern-California architect specializing in dwellings that are in close harmony with nature.
