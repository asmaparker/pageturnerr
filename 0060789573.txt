{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'An important and powerful policeman has been murdered, bludgeoned to death in his own kitchen. Few in suburban Surrey mourn the violent passing of Division Commander Alastair Gilbert, whose arrogance and cruelty were legendary in his village and in wider police circles -- which only makes the job of Scotland Yard investigators Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James more difficult. And as every discovery reveals another instance of misplaced trust, festering secrets, and murderous rage, they must put aside their own personal feelings for the victim -- and for each other -- in the name of justice and the law.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/72/9780060789572.jpg', 'title_long': 'Mourn Not Your Dead (Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James Novels)', 'edition': '~', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.38 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.84}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.38}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-10-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Deborah Crombie'], 'title': 'Mourn Not Your Dead (Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James Novels)', 'isbn13': '9780060789572', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060789573', 'isbn10': '0060789573'}}
