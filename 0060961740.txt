{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperReference', 'synopsis': 'Now in print for the first time in almost 40 years, The New Lifetime Reading Plan provides readers with brief, informative and entertaining introductions to more than 130 classics of world literature. From Homer to Hawthorne, Plato to Pascal, and Shakespeare to Solzhenitsyn, the great writers of Western civilization can be found in its pages. In addition, this new edition offers a much broader representation of women authors, such as Charlotte Bront%, Emily Dickinson and Edith Wharton, as well as non-Western writers such as Confucius, Sun-Tzu, Chinua Achebe, Mishima Yukio and many others.<br/>This fourth edition also features a simpler format that arranges the works chronologically in five sections (The Ancient World; 300-1600; 1600-1800; and The 20th Century), making them easier to look up than ever before. It deserves a place in the libraries of all lovers of literature.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/49/9780060961749.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Lifetime Reading Plan', 'edition': '3', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.11 Inches, Length: 6.11 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1.11 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.11}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.11}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.11}}, 'pages': 303, 'date_published': '1988', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Books & Reading', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Publishing & Books'], 'authors': ['Clifton Fadiman'], 'title': 'The Lifetime Reading Plan', 'isbn13': '9780060961749', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060961740', 'isbn10': '0060961740'}}
