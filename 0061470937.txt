{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Winter Ashburn was once the toast of the ton, but now she skirts the margins of high society by stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Her latest mark is none other than Rory Jameson, the rake who dared mistake her for a lady of the evening. Winter has stolen from her fair share of scandalously handsome men in the past . . . so why does her heart beat faster as she approaches his door?<br/>Rory Jameson is a rake, it's true. And he's caught many a thief while on secret missions for the Crown, but none has been this intriguing, this enticing. He will make Winter repay what she took so shamelessly . . . and melt her icy façade with the heat of his wicked touch. But her kiss sets his soul on fire—and now he will never be satisfied until he has made this alluring temptress his own.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/36/9780061470936.jpg', 'title_long': 'Passion and Pleasure in London (Charmed and Dangerous)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.41005980732 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41005980732}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-08-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Melody Thomas'], 'title': 'Passion and Pleasure in London (Charmed and Dangerous)', 'isbn13': '9780061470936', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006198275X'}, 'isbn': '0061470937', 'isbn10': '0061470937', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061982750', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
