{'book': {'publisher': 'Gramercy', 'synopsis': "Jane Austen wrote in the eighteenth century, but her novels are timeless. This complete anthology is unique among single-volume editions of her work because it includes the obscure but delightful Lady Susan, along with the six better-known novels and thirty of Hugh Thomson's irresistible drawings.<br/>All of Jane Austen's novels are love stories, all are stories of country gentry, and all end happily, one way or another. Her plots have the complexity of life and her characters are described with inimitable style and wit—whether caustic or warmly affectionate.<br/>The novels contained in this anthology are Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, and Lady Susan. The nineteenth-century illustrations of Hugh Thomson capture the flavor of Jane Austen's characters and enhance this extraordinary collection of the complete works of one of the greatest novelists of all time.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/90/9780517118290.jpg', 'title_long': 'Jane Austen: The Complete Novels', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.22 Inches, Length: 6.32 Inches, Weight: 1.7857443222 Pounds, Width: 2.18 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.32}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 2.18}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.7857443222}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.22}}, 'pages': 1136, 'date_published': '1994-06-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies'], 'authors': ['Jane Austen'], 'title': 'Jane Austen: The Complete Novels', 'isbn13': '9780517118290', 'msrp': 12.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0517118297', 'isbn10': '0517118297'}}
