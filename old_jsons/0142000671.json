{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin', 'synopsis': 'They are an unlikely pair: George is "small and quick and dark of face"; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a "family," clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California\'s dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.<br/><br/>When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations of a flirtatious woman, nor predict the consequences of Lennie\'s unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. "A thriller, a gripping tale . . . that you will not set down until it is finished. Steinbeck has touched the quick." —The New York Times', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/70/9780142000670.jpg', 'title_long': 'Of Mice and Men (Steinbeck Centennial Edition)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.61 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.35 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.61}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.35}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4}}, 'pages': 112, 'date_published': '2002-01-08', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['John Steinbeck'], 'title': 'Of Mice and Men (Steinbeck Centennial Edition)', 'isbn13': '9780142000670', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0142000671', 'isbn10': '0142000671'}}
