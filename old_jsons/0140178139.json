Sachs had a marriage Aaron envied, an intelligence he admired, a world he shared. And then suddenly, after a near-fatal fall that might or might not have been intentional, Sachs disappeared. Now Aaron must piece together the life that led to Sach’s death. His sole aim is to tell the truth and preserve it—before those who are investigating the case invent an account of their own.<br/><br/>Leviathan is a daring and immensely moving story by an author whom The Times Literary Supplement has called “one of America’s most spectacularly inventive writers.”', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/35/9780140178135.jpg', 'title_long': 'Leviathan', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.57 Inches, Length: 7.92 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 5.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.92}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044933474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.57}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1993-09-01', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Political', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Paul Auster'], 'title': 'Leviathan', 'isbn13': '9780140178135', 'msrp': 18, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1101562617'}, 'isbn': '0140178139', 'isbn10': '0140178139', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101562611', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
