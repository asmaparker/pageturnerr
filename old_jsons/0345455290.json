{'book': {'publisher': 'Del Rey', 'synopsis': '“A fitting eulogy to the master of wacky words and even wackier tales . . . Salmon leaves no doubt as to Adams’s lasting legacy.”—Entertainment Weekly<br/><br/>With an introduction to the introduction by Terry Jones<br/><br/>Douglas Adams changed the face of science fiction with his cosmically comic novel The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and its classic sequels. Sadly for his countless admirers, he hitched his own ride to the great beyond much too soon. Culled posthumously from Adams’s fleet of beloved Macintosh computers, this selection of essays, articles, anecdotes, and stories offers a fascinating and intimate portrait of the multifaceted artist and absurdist wordsmith.<br/><br/>Join Adams on an excursion to climb Kilimanjaro . . . dressed in a rhino costume; peek into the private life of Genghis Khan—warrior and world-class neurotic; root for the harried author’s efforts to get a Hitchhiker movie off the ground in Hollywood; thrill to the further exploits of private eye Dirk Gently and two-headed alien Zaphod Beeblebrox. Though Douglas Adams is gone, he’s left us something very special to remember him by. Without a doubt.<br/><br/>“Worth reading and even cherishing, if only because it’s the last we’ll hear from the master of comic science fiction.”—The Star-Ledger', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/91/9780345455291.jpg', 'title_long': "The Salmon of Doubt (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.87 Inches, Length: 4.12 Inches, Weight: 0.375 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.88}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.375}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.87}}, 'pages': 292, 'date_published': '2005-04-26', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Computers & Internet', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Action & Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera'], 'authors': ['Douglas Adams'], 'title': "The Salmon of Doubt (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)", 'isbn13': '9780345455291', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0345484495', 'ePub': '0345484495'}, 'isbn': '0345455290', 'isbn10': '0345455290', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780345484499', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
