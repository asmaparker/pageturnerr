Much has been written about Warren Buffett and his investment philosophy; little has been made public about the inside management of Berkshire Hathaway. With a market cap exceeding 100 billion , Berkshire Hathaway has a market value surpassing many icons of American business such as Dell, AT&T, Disney, Ford, Gillette, American Express, and GM. Drawing on his personal experiences as well as those of Berkshire\'s chief executives, officers, and directors interviewed for this book, Berkshire insider Robert P. Miles provides a unique look at the Berkshire Hathaway culture and its management principles.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/52/9780471430452.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Warren Buffett CEO: Secrets from the Berkshire Hathaway Managers', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.547225 Inches, Length: 6.14172 Inches, Weight: 1.06042348022 Pounds, Width: 0.574802 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.14172}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.574802}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.06042348022}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.547225}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2003-04-18', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Investing', 'Introduction', 'Management & Leadership', 'Management', 'Personal Finance', 'Business Development & Entrepreneurship', 'Entrepreneurship'], 'authors': ['Robert P.
