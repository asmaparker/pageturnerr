{'book': {'publisher': 'Puffin', 'synopsis': 'Ever eaten Poodle Strudel? Slain a Jabberwock? Bathed in Irish Stew? Quentin Blake is one of the best loved of childrenâ€™s illustrators. In this brilliant book he has selected and illustrated his favourite comic verse, making it pure entertainment for nonsense-lovers of all ages. His unique style of drawing brings a new perspective to every poem. Classic writers such as Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear are combined with more contemporary talents such as Roger McGough, Margaret Mahy and Russell Hoban. With fifteen wonderfully absurd sections, including Distracting Creatures, Sticky Ends, I Wish I Were a Jelly Fish, A Recipe for Indigestion and Chortling and Galumphing, here is a delightful collection of the topsy-turvy, the fantastical, the anarchic, the illogical and the utterly wonderful.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/00/9780140366600.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Puffin Book of Nonsense Verse (Puffin Poetry)', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'height: 198 mm, length: 129 mm, width: 17 mm, weight: 202 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 129}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 202}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 198}}, 'pages': 292, 'date_published': '1996', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Activities, Crafts & Games', 'Crafts & Hobbies', 'Kindle Store', 'Categories', 'Kindle eBooks'], 'authors': ['Quentin Blake'], 'title': 'The Puffin Book of Nonsense Verse (Puffin Poetry)', 'isbn13': '9780140366600', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Kindle Edition', 'isbn': '0140366601', 'isbn10': '0140366601'}}
