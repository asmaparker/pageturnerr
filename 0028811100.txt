{'book': {'publisher': "Brassey's Inc", 'synopsis': "Soviet Central Asia: an exotic region of harsh deserts and rugged mountains shut off by communism since 1917, mysterious lands that still evoke images of the ancient Silk Road caravans. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tatarstan, and Azerbaijan are primarily inhabited by Muslim peoples of whom we know very little.<br/>Now that the long winter of communism has ended and these new republics slowly open to the West, syndicated columnist and television personality Georgie Anne Geyer has taken it upon herself to learn more. A modern-day Marco Polo, she shares her eye-opening personal experiences in Waiting for Winter to End. Join her as she sets out from Moscow for Kazan and Alma-Ata, Bishkek and Tashkent, Samarkand and Baku. Sit in on her interviews with nascent political leaders about the post-Soviet situation, in which possible dangers for the United States are revealed. Travel with a witty, observant, and knowledgeable companion to a resources-rich region that will become more and more important for the world. Georgie Anne Geyer's latest book is a lively, multifaceted account of her adventures in places to which few Westerners have gone before. Part travelogue, part history, part insider's political briefing - an entirely enjoyable and entertaining read.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/09/9780028811109.jpg', 'title_long': 'Waiting for Winter to End: An Extraordinary Journey Through Soviet Central Asia', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.763698096 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.763698096}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 237, 'date_published': '1994', 'subjects': ['Travel', 'Asia', 'India', 'General'], 'authors': ['Georgie Anne Geyer'], 'title': 'Waiting for Winter to End: An Extraordinary Journey Through Soviet Central Asia', 'isbn13': '9780028811109', 'msrp': 11.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0028811100', 'isbn10': '0028811100'}}
