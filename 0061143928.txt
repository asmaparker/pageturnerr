{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "One of the NFL's sexiest stars, Kahari Brown knows how to handle a football and a pretty lady—or so he always thought. But lately his smooth moves off the field are only getting him into hot water.<br/>And no one is hotter than Zoë Andrews, who would do anything to make it as a top sports reporter. When she thrusts a mic in Kahari's face and asks him if he's the father of a crazy fan's baby, the irate athlete's first inclination is to toss her out of the locker room on her shapely butt. But there's something about Zoë . . .<br/>Zoë can't help noticing that this brother is mighty fine. Now the heat is on and Zoë is wondering if she should have fanned the flames—because now she's falling for Kahari's charm, which is something she swore she'd never do. But is he sweet-talking his way into her heart for love—or for something else?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/22/9780061143922.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sweet Spot', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2007-09-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Erotica', 'Humorous', 'Poetry', 'Romantic', 'Romance', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Kayla Perrin'], 'title': 'Sweet Spot', 'isbn13': '9780061143922', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061143928', 'isbn10': '0061143928'}}
