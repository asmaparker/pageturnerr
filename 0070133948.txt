{'book': {'publisher': 'International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press', 'synopsis': 'Step by step, picture by picture, here is a complete reference on evaluating the condition of fiberglass sailboats using common sense and proven advice rather than complicated methodology. Current owners will find out how to prioritize maintenance tasks or prepare a boat to sell, while prospective owners will learn how to find good value and avoid pitfalls. "Surveying" a boat conjures an image of complex diagnostics using moisture meters and ultrasound. But premier boating writer Don Casey shows that, most of the time, owners and shoppers can learn what they need to know by rapping, poking, looking, and listening. Hull, deck, rig, interior, engine, electrical system--all are covered in a lavishly illustrated format. Casey also guides readers through the process of hiring a professional surveyor, but it won\'t often be necessary. Whether maintaining or shopping, readers can save hundreds, even thousands, of dollars in survey fees with the help of this peerless guide.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/45/9780070133945.jpg', 'title_long': 'Inspecting the Aging Sailboat', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 7.4 Inches, Weight: 1.0582188576 Pounds, Width: 0.66 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.66}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.0582188576}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.2}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '1996-11-01', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Water Sports', 'Boating', 'Sailing'], 'authors': ['Don Casey'], 'title': 'Inspecting the Aging Sailboat', 'isbn13': '9780070133945', 'msrp': 21.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0070133948', 'isbn10': '0070133948'}}
