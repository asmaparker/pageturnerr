{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'A sensuous and compelling novel of passion and vengeance, fact and fiction based on a real-life murder in 1950s Bombay. . . . “[A] brilliant insider-outsider account of India.”—Daily Mail<br/>The past is never finished with because the present is its perpetually unfolding consequence. The reverberations from the notorious Nanavati society murder in 1950s Bombay—the fatal consequence of a doomed love triangle involving an Indian playboy, his married English lover, and her jealous Indian husband—were so great they reached the offices of Prime Minister Nehru and changed the face of the Indian justice system. But there was a connected crime, an unreported and unpunished event so cruel it destroyed the lives of two women. . . .<br/>In contemporary London, Bhalu, a bookseller, unexpectedly meets his childhood friend, Phoebe, 40 years after their idyllic childhood in India. Together they will return to their homeland to solve the mystery of this long-buried crime and exact revenge for the women involved—their mothers. But in the simmering bazaars of Bombay, the adversary they seek still wields enormous power and soon the friends find themselves in real, terrifying danger.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/65/9780060562465.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Death of Mr. Love: A Novel', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 1.61 Pounds, Width: 1.33 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.33}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.61}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2004-11-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Indra Sinha'], 'title': 'The Death of Mr. Love: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060562465', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060562463', 'isbn10': '0060562463'}}
