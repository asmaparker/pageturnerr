The story of several generations of a Scottish West Coast fishing community -- taking us from the last century when fishermen went off to sea in rowing boats through to the present day, in which fishing vessels are electronic masterpieces. Echo sounders have now taken over from instinct, but the old traditions and superstitions still apply: family links are still strong; the same fishermens' names appear generation after generation. And the women still play their part, but no longer follow the boats from harbour to harbour to gut the fish; instead they stay at home, listening to the weather forecast on the radio, anxious about the terrors of crowded shipping lanes and the dangers of iced-up fishing gear.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/44/9780006552444.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Last Wanderer', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.6834330122 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6834330122}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Meg Henderson'], 'title': 'The Last Wanderer', 'isbn13': '9780006552444', 'msrp': 13.06, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0006552447', 'isbn10': '0006552447'}}
