Even for those not ready to replace sirloin with soy bean, Gregory\'s discourse on the typical mistreatment of the digestive tract should be informative- it certainly is amusing. There are sections on Gregory\'s various fasts, suggested diets for putting on and taking off weight, and even a discussion of natural food substitutes for your favorite alcoholic concoction. Good fun and a good guide for those who feel they are what they eat."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/55/9780060803155.jpg', 'title_long': "Dick Gregory's Natural Diet for Folks Who Eat: Cookin' With Mother Nature", 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '1974', 'subjects': ['Medical Books'], 'authors': ['Dick Gregory'], 'title': "Dick Gregory's Natural Diet for Folks Who Eat: Cookin' With Mother Nature", 'isbn13': '9780060803155', 'msrp': 7, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060803150', 'isbn10': '0060803150'}}
