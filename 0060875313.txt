Poignant, honest, sometimes heartbreaking, often wry, and funny, here is a book that examines caregiving from every angle, revealing the pain, intimacy, and grace inherent in this meaningful relationship.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/12/9780060875312.jpg', 'title_long': 'Uncertain Inheritance, An: Writers on Caring for Family', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.51 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.51}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2008-12-02', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Death & Grief', 'Grief & Bereavement', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Aging Parents', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Reference', 'Nursing', 'Home & Community Health'], 'authors': ['Nell Casey'], 'title': 'Uncertain Inheritance, An: Writers on Caring for Family', 'isbn13': '9780060875312', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061843121'}, 'isbn': '0060875313', 'isbn10': '0060875313', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061843129', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
