{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "The fast lane is much too slow for Rachel Walsh. And Manhattan is the perfect place for a young Irish female to overdo everything. But Rachel's love of a good time is about to land her in the emergency room. It will also cost her a job and the boyfriend she adores.<br/>When her loving family hustles her back home and checks her into Ireland's answer to the Betty Ford Clinic, Rachel is hopeful. Perhaps it will be lovelyâ€”spa treatments, celebrities, that kind of thing. Instead, she finds a lot of group therapy, which leads her, against her will, to some important self-knowledge. She will also find something that all women like herself fear: a man who might actually be good for her.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/88/9780060090388.jpg', 'title_long': "Rachel's Holiday", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.98 Pounds, Width: 0.95 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.95}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.98}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 592, 'date_published': '2002-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Friendship', 'Sisters', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Historical', '20th Century', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Marian Keyes'], 'title': "Rachel's Holiday", 'isbn13': '9780060090388', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060090383', 'isbn10': '0060090383', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061840050', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
