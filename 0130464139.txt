Jerry Weissman shows presenters of all kinds how to dump those PowerPoint templates once and for all--and learn to tell compelling stories that focus on what's in it for their listeners. Drawing on dozens of practical examples and real case studies, Weissman shows presenters how to identify their real goals and messages before they even open PowerPoint; how to stay focused on what their listeners really care about; and how to capture their audiences in the first crucial 90 seconds. From bullets and graphics to the effective, sparing use of special effects, Weissman covers all the practical mechanics of effective presentation--and walks readers through every step of building a Power Presentation, from brainstorming through delivery. Unlike the techniques in other presentation books, this book's easy, step-by-step approach has been proven with billions of dollars on the line, in hundreds of IPO road shows before the world's most jaded investors.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/32/9780130464132.jpg', 'title_long': 'Presenting to Win: The Art of Telling Your Story', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.46386941968 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.46386941968}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Marketing', 'Skills', 'Communications', 'Running Meetings & Presentations'], 'authors': ['Jerry Weissman'], 'title': 'Presenting to Win: The Art of Telling Your Story', 'isbn13': '9780130464132', 'msrp': 29.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0130464139', 'isbn10': '0130464139'}}
