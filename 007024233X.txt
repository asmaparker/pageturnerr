{'book': {'publisher': 'International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press', 'synopsis': "Boat noodling. Boat lovers suffer universally from this benign affliction. In its mildest form, boat noodling is nothing more than wondering why that sloop in the next slip is faster than yours. In a more significant manifestation it could mean serious daydreaming--drifting off for extended periods, sketching design ideas on the back of an envelope. Chances are, if you've picked up this book just to see what's in it, you're beyond help.<br/>Naval architect Dave Gerr offers the perfect antidote, a browser's reference to understanding how boats tick: all you've ever wanted to know about boats--power and sail, racer and cruiser; dinghy and motoryacht.<br/>In the clear, friendly, nontechnical style that has made his column for Offshore magazine so enduring and popular, Gerr explains everything from how thick a hull should be to why one sailboat tips less than another, from choosing an engine to designing a rig for your trawler yacht, from building a dinghy to simple rules of thumb for dozens of design quandaries.<br/>Gerr writes for the boat noodler in all of us--those seriously interested in learning and dreaming about all types of watercraft. There is no better way to become a better sailor, equipped to handle any contingency. And there's no better place to start than right here.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/33/9780070242333.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Nature of Boats: Insights and Esoterica for the Nautically Obsessed', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.1 Inches, Length: 7.3 Inches, Weight: 1.63803460666 Pounds, Width: 1.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.63803460666}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.1}}, 'pages': 418, 'date_published': '1995-09-22', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Water Sports', 'Boating', 'Sailing', 'Sea Kayaking'], 'authors': ['Dave Gerr'], 'title': 'The Nature of Boats: Insights and Esoterica for the Nautically Obsessed', 'isbn13': '9780070242333', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '007024233X', 'isbn10': '007024233X'}}
