{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperOne', 'synopsis': '“A highly original, moving, and ultimately life-affirming book.” – Sunday Mirror (London)<br/>Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything – youth and beauty, boyfriends and a loving family, a fulfilling job. But something is missing in her life. So, one cold November morning. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting to never wake up. But she does—at a mental hospital where she is told that she has only days to live.<br/>Inspired by events in Coelho’s own life, Veronika Decides to Die questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Bold and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/79/9780060955779.jpg', 'title_long': 'Veronika Decides to Die', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.375 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.375}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 210, 'date_published': '2001-05-08', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Psychological', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Paulo Coelho'], 'title': 'Veronika Decides to Die', 'isbn13': '9780060955779', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060955775', 'isbn10': '0060955775'}}
