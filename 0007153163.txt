{'book': {'publisher': 'Collins', 'synopsis': 'Down on his luck and kicked in the pants one too many times, sixteen-year-old Pagan Kidrouk arrives on the doorstep of the Templar Knights in medieval Jerusalem, looking for work as a squire. He’s expecting only some protection from the seedier aspects of life on the street and a few square meals. Instead, Pagan finds himself hard at work for Lord Roland de Bram - an exciting life of polishing Lord Roland’s armor, laundering his garments, and even training to fight by his side.<br/><br/>But as the Infidel Saladin leads his army to Jerusalem, it becomes more and more difficult for Pagan and Lord Roland to discern what action to take or whom to trust. Neither Saladin’s army nor the Christian Crusaders offer easy answers. Is a bloody battle for control of the Holy City inevitable?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/69/9780007153169.jpg', 'title_long': "Pagan's Crusade", 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.48060773116 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48060773116}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2004-02-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors': ['Catherine Jinks'], 'title': "Pagan's Crusade", 'isbn13': '9780007153169', 'msrp': 12.4, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0007153163', 'isbn10': '0007153163'}}
