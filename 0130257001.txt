It focuses not only on child development from pre-birth through age eight, but upon the roles and responsibilities of adults who care for and teach young children. An ecological perspective looks at family, community, school, and society as a whole, and offers readers a broad view of the many possible influences on human growth and development. Chapter topics include the where, when, and how of early childhood study and assessment; and the physical, motor, psychosocial, cognitive, language, and literacy development of infants and young children. For those who will teach and work with young children, and particularly appropriate for early childhood education programs.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/00/9780130257000.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Young Child: Development from Prebirth through Age Eight (3rd Edition)', 'edition': 'Subsequent', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 2.20462262 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.20462262}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 574, 'date_published': '2000-07-17', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Child Psychology', 'Developmental Psychology', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Early Childhood', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Margaret B.
