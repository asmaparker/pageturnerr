The object of her dreams is the fabulously rich Lord Sebastian, he of the ice-blue eyes, golden hair, and full-on mastery of the dance floor. To Nicky, Lord S. is a god. But are gods always quite as perfect as they are meant to be?<br/>Nicola, sixteen and an orphan, always gets what she wants. She's ready to dive headlong into her first glittering London society season. She's also ready to dive headlong into the arms of handsome and debonair Lord Sebastian. Nicola's dream is a proposal from the viscount—a dream she's about to realize at last!<br/>So naturally, Nathaniel Sheridan's insinuations about her fiancé's flawed character annoy her mightily.<br/>But when Nicola's natural curiosity gets the best of her, she begins to piece together a few things for herself. To her great surprise, Nicola realizes she's had the wrong viscount all along . . . but is it too late to make things right?<br/>Nicola could feel Lord Sebastian's heart beating. It was the most delightful feeling in the world. Surely it meant that The God liked her. More than simply liked her—loved her even. It had to!
