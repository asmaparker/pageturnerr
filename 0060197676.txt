{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "What a difference a woman makes. The nine women of the United States Senate have changed the political landscape, and there's no turning back. Now, for the first time, in Nine and Counting, readers will be treated to an inside view of their private and public lives. As the senators share their stories and reflections with refreshing candor, insight, and humor, they demonstrate how ordinary women can overcome barriers and achieve extraordinary goals. These nine women are more different than they are alike. Their backgrounds, personal styles, and political ideals are as diverse as the United States itself. Yet they share a commonality that runs deeper than politics or geography: the desire to give voice to all of their constituents while serving as role models for women young and old. Each seantor brings her unique perspective to the mix.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/74/9780060197674.jpg', 'title_long': 'Nine and Counting: The Women of the Senate', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2000-07-25', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political'], 'authors': ['Barbara Mikulski', 'Susan Collins', 'Dianne Feinstein', 'The USA Girl Scouts of', 'Whitney Catherine', 'Kay Bailey Hutchison', 'Barbara Boxer', 'Patty Murray', 'Olympia Snowe', 'Susan M.
