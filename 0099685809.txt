{'book': {'publisher': 'ARROW (RAND)', 'synopsis': '<p>When Michael Collins signed the Anglo Irish Treaty in December 1921, he remarked to Lord Birkenhead, " I may have signed my actual death warrant." And in August 1922, that prophecy came true - Collins was shot and killed by a fellow Irishman. So ended the life of the greatest of all Irish nationalists, but his vision and legacy lived on. This authoritative and comprehensive biography presents the life of a man who became a legend in his own lifetime, whose idealistic vigor and determination were matched only by his political realism and supreme organizational abilities.</p>', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/07/9780099685807.jpg', 'title_long': 'Michael Collins', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Width: 1.25984 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25984}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 536, 'date_published': '1991', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'History', 'Europe', 'Great Britain'], 'authors': ['Tim Pat Coogan'], 'title': 'Michael Collins', 'isbn13': '9780099685807', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099685809', 'isbn10': '0099685809'}}
