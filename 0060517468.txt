{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "When you least expect it, life can turn you around. Take forty-something Jane Larson. Although she views her situation with wry humor, her life feels frozen. An architect, she's had the same job for eighteen years, designing chain banks, grocery stores, and dry cleaners instead of the beautiful houses she craves to create. Living in Brooklyn with her difficult teenage daughters, she's lost all hope for the possibility of love or excitement.<br/>Then she's let go from her firm and is suddenly free to pursue her career dreams. And when she contacts her old college flame, an exhilarating long-distance correspondence with him reawakens that part of her she's long ignored. Does Jane have the courage to gamble with her heart? Can happily-ever-after be a reality for people who've done it all before?<br/>With warmth and humor Fields explores the territory of middle age, proving that it's never too late to reinvent your life, or to take the risks that bring us the pleasures we all deserve.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/65/9780060517465.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Middle Ages: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.52}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2003-07-08', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Jennie Fields'], 'title': 'The Middle Ages: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060517465', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061871680'}, 'isbn': '0060517468', 'isbn10': '0060517468', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061871689', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
