{'book': {'publisher': 'Financial Times Press', 'synopsis': 'Following in the bestselling footsteps of Little Red Book of Selling, Little Red Book of Sales Answers, Little Black Book of Connections, and Little Gold Book of YES! Attitude, Jeffrey Gitomer\'s Little Green Book of Getting Your Way digs deep into the 9.5 elements that make getting your way, and persuasion, happen. By breaking down the elements, readers will begin to understand, take action, become proficient, and then master the ability to get their way. Because persuasion occurs in so many different areas of life and business, Gitomer leads the reader from mental readiness to the principles of getting your way and the power that persuasion offers. He challenges the reader to prepare before they present, to prepare before they try to persuade. He demonstrates how to change a presentation into a performance and shows how this can be done in any environment. But because persuasion most often takes place in business, he draws special emphasis to the reader\'s ability to write and sell persuasively. The book talks about the persistence that enables getting your way. He brings the Benjamin Franklin quote "If at first you don\'t succeed, try, try again" to the Gitomer level of "You only fail when you decide to quit," and the book ends challenging the reader how to think about excellence and eloquence. It will be up to the reader to take advantage of the opportunity and harness the power.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/70/9780131576070.jpg', 'title_long': "Jeffrey Gitomer's Little Green Book of Getting Your Way: How to Speak, Write, Present, Persuade, Influence, and Sell Your Point of View to Others", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 202, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Business & Money', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Sales & Selling', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jeffrey Gitomer'], 'title': "Jeffrey Gitomer's Little Green Book of Getting Your Way: How to Speak, Write, Present, Persuade, Influence, and Sell Your Point of View to Others", 'isbn13': '9780131576070', 'msrp': 19.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0131576070', 'isbn10': '0131576070'}}
