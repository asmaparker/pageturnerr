Celeste blames the housemates, convinced they want to scare her into leaving. And while Leena tries to play peacekeeper between her best friends and new roommate, soon the mysterious happenings in the dorm, an intense triangle between Leena, Celeste, and David, and the reawakening of childhood fears all push Leena to take increasingly desperate measures to feel safe. But does the threat lie with her new roommate, within Leena’s own mind . . . or in Frost House itself?<br/>Frost is a stunning and surprising tale of suspense from debut author Marianna Baer.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/95/9780061799495.jpg', 'title_long': 'Frost', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.15081300764 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15081300764}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2011-09-13', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Horror'], 'authors': ['Marianna Baer'], 'title': 'Frost', 'isbn13': '9780061799495', 'msrp': 17.09, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061799491', 'isbn10': '0061799491'}}
