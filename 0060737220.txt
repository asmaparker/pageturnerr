{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTorch', 'synopsis': "THE DAY OF JUSTICE IS AT HAND<br/>A talented healer forced to become a fugitive for a killing he wasn't responsible for, Jake Horn found sanctuary in the rough Dakota town of Sweet Sorrow—and in the tin badge that marks him as the local law. Now his discovery of a dead ranch hand is bringing his demons home.<br/>As a doctor and a sheriff, Jake's witnessed death in all its dark guises—and he recognizes a murder when he sees one. But asking too many questions of the wrong people is asking for trouble, and suddenly expert killers are gathering with their sights on a lawman who's got a need to see justice done. The big gundown is coming, as relentlessly as the winter snow whipping across the prairie. And there's nowhere for a good man to hide when five shooters blinded by hate won't leave Sweet Sorrow until he's dead.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/21/9780060737221.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dakota Lawman: The Big Gundown (dakota Lawman)', 'edition': '1st Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.62 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.2755778275 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.2755778275}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.62}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Westerns'], 'authors': ['Bill Brooks'], 'title': 'Dakota Lawman: The Big Gundown (dakota Lawman)', 'isbn13': '9780060737221', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061741191'}, 'isbn': '0060737220', 'isbn10': '0060737220', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061741197', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
