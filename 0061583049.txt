{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTeen', 'synopsis': "Each discovery disturbs the arrangements of the known world, and it is our job to stay alert to all possibilities.<br/>LaVaughn believes she is keeping alert to all possibilities. She has made it through the projects, she's gotten over heartbreak, she's grown up, and now she's been admitted to the Women in Science program that might finally be her ticket to COLLEGE. But the discoveries she makes during her senior year in high school--two girls pregnant, with very few options--disturb everything in her known world. And in an effort to bring together people who should love each other, she jeopardizes the one prize she has sought her whole life long.<br/>When do you know whether you're doing the right thing? What happens when you can't find a way to make lemonade out of lemons? Virginia Euwer Wolff takes on the biggest questions--about life and love, certainly, but also about girls and women, sacrifice and compassion--and has something quite rev-elatory to say about them in this full house.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/49/9780061583049.jpg', 'title_long': 'This Full House (Make Lemonade)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.49 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.49}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2009-01-27', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Girls & Women', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Social Issues'], 'authors': ['Virginia Euwer Wolff'], 'title': 'This Full House (Make Lemonade)', 'isbn13': '9780061583049', 'msrp': 9.49, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061583049', 'isbn10': '0061583049'}}
