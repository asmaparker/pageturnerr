{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'An obsession that blooms into scandal<br/>Since childhood, Ryan Donally adored Rachel Bailey, though the brilliant, beautiful lass saw him as just another rowdy boy. The years pulled them apart, carrying Rachel to a place of responsibility and respect few women of her time enjoyed . . . while Ryan ascended to undreamed-of heights of wealth and success, and bound his heart to another.<br/>Now fate has brought them together once againâ€”and Rachel sees not the boy she once spurned, but a breathtaking man she desires. Yet Ryan has moved on and is unwilling to forgive, and Rachel hides a secret shame that could destroy everything she has worked for. Then, in one moment of unrestrained passion, the walls between them tumble, and the price they must pay is a marriage neither can afford. But will a sensuous fire too-long resisted bring tragedy . . . or will it forge a glorious and undying love?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/17/9780060742317.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Match Made in Scandal (Donally Family Series, 3)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-08-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Melody Thomas'], 'title': 'A Match Made in Scandal (Donally Family Series, 3)', 'isbn13': '9780060742317', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061747432'}, 'isbn': '0060742313', 'isbn10': '0060742313', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061747434', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
