She hadn\'t wanted to leave her friends, and she wished that fall would come quickly.<br/>But in spite of all her gloomy predictions, Katie John had a wonderful summer. With her new friend, Sue Halsey, she explored the old house and found it full of exciting surprises. The girls founded a society to improve people, and "improved" Sue\'s infuriating older sister with amazing results.<br/>The summer flew by and fall arrived all too soon. Playing a more responsible and adult role than ever before, Katie John was instrumental in deciding her family\'s future. Young readers will be delighted by impulsive, warm-hearted Katie John, for, as the Virginia Kirkus Service review says, Mrs. Calhoun "imbues her story with a good feeling of locale, a strong sense of seasonal Change, and above all a vigorous portrayal of an appealing and lively heroine."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/13/9780060209513.jpg', 'title_long': 'Katie John', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.375 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.375}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.61}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '1960-01-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Where We Live'], 'authors': ['Mary Calhoun'], 'title': 'Katie John', 'isbn13': '9780060209513', 'msrp': 16.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0060209518', 'isbn10': '0060209518'}}
