{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Top 7 Reasons Why She\'s No Angel<br/>7. Easily Palm Beach\'s sexiest private investigator, Angel Devlin always gets her man -- and bad boy millionaire Tom Donovan is at the top of her Most Wanted list.<br/>6. Instinct tells her that drop-dead-gorgeous Tom has something wicked up his sleeve, and she\'s going to get up close and personal to find out just what.<br/>5. Her list of nocturnal activities includes lifting a wallet while seductively skimming her hands over her victim\'s rock-solid chest and performing a bewitching lap dance at a seedy underground club.<br/>4. There\'s nothing sweet or innocent about Angel -- she\'s as sharp as the steel stiletto she wears strapped to her shapely thigh.<br/>3. Her motto is "dress to thrill." A tight skirt, a hint of cleavage, and a pair of kick-ass Jimmy Choos will make a man open up and divulge all sorts of little secrets.<br/>2. Angel is devilish, devious, and sexy as sin.<br/>1. She\'s the first to admit she\'s no angel, but it doesn\'t stop Tom from falling head over heels in love with the mischievous blonde.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/68/9780060544768.jpg', 'title_long': "I'm No Angel", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-06-29', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Patti Berg'], 'title': "I'm No Angel", 'isbn13': '9780060544768', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060544767', 'isbn10': '0060544767'}}
