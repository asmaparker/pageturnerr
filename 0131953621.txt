{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': 'This book is distinguished by the anthropological or ethnographic approach to cross-cultural or multicultural social work practice. James Green is an anthropologist who brings a unique perspective to social work practice, moving well beyond cultural "sensitivity" to issues of professional practice. The book is based on an established model, that of "help-seeking behavior," that is also widely used in cross-cultural psychiatric and medical work. New topics addressed in this edition include the recent DSM-IV (with its first-time inclusion of a section on "cultural formations"); post-modernism in the social services, with its emphasis on narratives as a means of understanding cases; cultural competence and qualitative evaluation in agencies; new material on work with translators; and the emergence of biracial and bicultural consciousness in American popular culture. The chapters on major ethnic groups in America have been updated with current material from the social services literature. Anthropologists, social workers, therapists, and psychologists.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/28/9780131953628.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cultural Awareness in the Human Services (Phalarope Book)', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.661386786 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.661386786}}, 'pages': 257, 'date_published': '1982-01', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Politics & Government', 'Public Affairs & Policy', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['James W.
