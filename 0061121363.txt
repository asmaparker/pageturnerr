No one wants to take responsibility and tell their employees what to do and how to do it. More importantly, no one wants to follow up and make sure that assignments were done and done right.<br/>Making a clear distinction between managers who interfere with the work at hand and managers who are simply afraid to take charge by setting clear goals and evaluating work, Tulgan opens eyes to the undisciplined workplace that is frustrating workers at every level. Giving a clear 8-step path to becoming a strong manager, Tulgan will empower anyone to be the best bosses they can be.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/64/9780061121364.jpg', 'title_long': "It's Okay to Be the Boss: The Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming the Manager Your Employees Need", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.71429772888 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.77}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.71429772888}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2007-03-13', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Memory Improvement', 'Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Leadership & Motivation', 'Management', 'Systems & Planning', 'Processes & Infrastructure', 'Organizational Learning', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Bruce Tulgan'], 'title': "It's Okay to Be the Boss: The Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming the Manager Your Employees Need", 'isbn13': '9780061121364', 'msrp': 14.81, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061745480'}, 'isbn': '0061121363', 'isbn10': '0061121363', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061745485', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
