{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "The New York Times bestselling debut novel from acclaimed children's author Katherine Hannigan is both very funny and extraordinarily moving.<br/>Who is Ida B. Applewood? She is a fourth grader like no other, living a life like no other, with a voice like no other, and her story will resonate long after you have put this book down.<br/>How does Ida B cope when outside forces—life, really—attempt to derail her and her family and her future? She enters her Black Period, and it is not pretty. But then, with the help of a patient teacher, a loyal cat and dog, her beloved apple trees, and parents who believe in the same things she does (even if they sometimes act as though they don't), the resilience that is the very essence of Ida B triumph...and Ida B. Applewood takes the hand that is extended and starts to grow up.<br/>This modern classic is a great choice for independent reading.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/46/9780060730246.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ida B: . . . and Her Plans to Maximize Fun, Avoid Disaster, and (Possibly) Save the World', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.89 Inches, Length: 7.72 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 5.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.72}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.89}}, 'pages': 246, 'date_published': '2004-08-17', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Health', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Where We Live', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Katherine Hannigan'], 'title': 'Ida B: . . . and Her Plans to Maximize Fun, Avoid Disaster, and (Possibly) Save the World', 'isbn13': '9780060730246', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060730242', 'isbn10': '0060730242'}}
