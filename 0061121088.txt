{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': "John Wood discovered his passion, his greatest success, and his life's work not at business school or helping lead Microsoft's charge into Asia in the 1990s but on a soul-searching trip to the Himalayas. He made the difficult decision to walk away from his lucrative career to create Room to Read, a nonprofit organization that promotes education across the developing world. By the end of 2007, the organization will have established over 5,000 libraries and 400 schools, and awarded long-term scholarships to more than 3,000 girls, giving more than one million children the lifelong gift of education.<br/>If you have ever pondered abandoning your desk job for an adventure and an opportunity to give back, Wood's story will inspire you. He offers a vivid, emotional, and absorbing tale of how to take the lessons learned at a hard-charging company like Microsoft and apply them to the world's most pressing social problems.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/81/9780061121081.jpg', 'title_long': "Leaving Microsoft to Change the World: An Entrepreneur's Odyssey to Educate the World's Children", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.71 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.71}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2007-09-04', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Motivational', 'Business Development & Entrepreneurship', 'Nonprofit Organizations & Charities', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Travel', 'Asia', 'Nepal', 'Tibet', 'General', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors': ['John Wood'], 'title': "Leaving Microsoft to Change the World: An Entrepreneur's Odyssey to Educate the World's Children", 'isbn13': '9780061121081', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061835528', 'eBook': '0061835528', 'ePub': '0061835528'}, 'isbn': '0061121088', 'isbn10': '0061121088', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061835520', 'binding': 'ebook'}]}}
