His most important and urgent message is, ultimately there is no division between life and death<br/>—there is only one continuous creative project. He affirms with abundant evidence that "the world beyond" is not separated from this world by an impenetrable wall, and that single reality embraces all worlds, all times and places.<br/>In Life After Death, Chopra draws on cutting-edge scientific discoveries and the great wisdom traditions to provide a map of the afterlife. It’s a fascinating journey into many levels of consciousness. In this book, Chopra invites us to become co-creators in this subtle realm.
