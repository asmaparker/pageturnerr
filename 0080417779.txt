{'book': {'publisher': 'Potomac Books Inc', 'synopsis': 'The increased activity of Third World arms producers and exporters is a growing phenomenon in international security. Little systematic study has been made of the incentives, performance and prospects of Arab defence production. This book tackles this subject and examines the continuing debate about the pros and cons of indigenous production in the Arab case. It looks in detail at the theoretical and strategic context of Arab arms production, local defence production in the Arab countries and assesses Arab military industrialisation. Yezid Sayigh presents a comprehensive overview of the present reality of Arab defence industries, and concludes that Arab countries will be frustrated in their desire to emulate foreign military development until the right industrial environment is created.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/76/9780080417776.jpg', 'title_long': 'Arab Military Industry: Capability, Performance and Impact (Centre for Arab Unity Studies)', 'edition': '1st English ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.00220462262 Pounds, Width: 1 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.00220462262}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 268, 'date_published': '1992', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism', 'Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Science & Math', 'Technology', 'History of Technology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government'], 'authors': ['Yezid Sayigh'], 'title': 'Arab Military Industry: Capability, Performance and Impact (Centre for Arab Unity Studies)', 'isbn13': '9780080417776', 'msrp': 63, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0080417779', 'isbn10': '0080417779'}}
