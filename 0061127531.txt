{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Proper, sensible Willow Mabson will do anything to protect her family. So when she finds out that James Sterling—a dashing, arrogant aristocrat working for Scotland Yard—suspects her mother in a recent murder, Willow will do whatever's necessary . . . even solve the case herself! Of course, this will bring her into a most uncomfortable proximity with the very tantalizing Mister Sterling. And try as she might, she finds resisting him her most difficult challenge.<br/>James has always preferred gritty crime scenes to elegant balls. And he can immediately deduce that straight-laced, whip-smart—and exceedingly delectable—Willow isn't your average vapid, shallow socialite. He longs to release her carefully restrained sensuality and tempt her into losing control. But James doesn't count on risking his own heart in the process.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/33/9780061127533.jpg', 'title_long': 'Tempted at Every Turn', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.3747858454 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3747858454}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2007-07-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Robyn DeHart'], 'title': 'Tempted at Every Turn', 'isbn13': '9780061127533', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061127531', 'isbn10': '0061127531'}}
