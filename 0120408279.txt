{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'This handy inexpensive reference tool is an organized annual review of synthetically useful information. It abstracts synthetic reactions from the major chemistry journals of the past year and includes reactions and methods that are new and reasonably general. The reactions are presented in a convenient pictorial format designed for rapid visual retrieval of information. A comprehensive table of contents and a senior author index are included.The Journal of the American Chemical Society has aptly described this publication as an "aid to the harassed organic chemist who cannot keep up with the never-diminishing stream of new primary literature" and hails it "an outstandingly good buy."<br/><br/>Key Features* Provides clearly illustrated structures of compounds in every feasible synthetic pathway* Presents a general review of structure/activity information for each synthetic compound* Includes extensive reference information on additional publications available for each reaction discussed* Yields a current awareness of the literature, ideas for research, and questions for cumulative exams* Remains the most comprehensive, reasonably priced compilation of its type', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/76/9780120408276.jpg', 'title_long': 'Annual Reports in Organic Synthesis 1997', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.433004703 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.433004703}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 458, 'date_published': '1997-09-16', 'subjects': ['Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Publishing & Books', 'Science & Math', 'Chemistry', 'Organic', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Weintraub'], 'title': 'Annual Reports in Organic Synthesis 1997', 'isbn13': '9780120408276', 'msrp': 143, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0120408279', 'isbn10': '0120408279'}}
