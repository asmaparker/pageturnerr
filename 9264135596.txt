{'book': {'publisher': 'Organization for Economic', 'synopsis': "Government support to economically strategic industries is already generating friction among governments, and promises to become a critical issue in the 1990s. Some governments consider support essential for an economy's competitiveness, while others see it as a major threat to the future of the international system of trade. The contributions to this report, based on an OECD Forum for the Future conference, assess the issues at stake, and conclude on the need for concerted international attention to the question of agreed guidelines for state support to R&D, greater international convergence of policies relating to competition and foreign investment, more analysis of structural differences between national economies, and the accessibility of technology for third world countries.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/98/9789264135598.jpg', 'title_long': 'Strategic Industries in a Global Economy: Policy Issues for the 1990s', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.212542441 pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.212542441}}, 'pages': 106, 'date_published': '1991', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'International', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Oecd International Futures Programme'], 'title': 'Strategic Industries in a Global Economy: Policy Issues for the 1990s', 'isbn13': '9789264135598', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9264135596', 'isbn10': '9264135596'}}
