Now, after decades, Dani's own loveless marriage is faltering—propelling her into the arms of another and inspiring troubling thoughts of escape from her husband and beloved young son.<br/>Dani fears the sins of the mother have been visited upon the daughter. And, unlike Rose, who never speaks of their lost parent, Dani can't help but wonder who Maria really was. It's a puzzle that may soon be solved because, in a time of emotional and physical chaos, Maria, calling herself Mariah, is about to re-enter her daughters' worlds—bearing secrets and bitter truths . . . and, perhaps, long-awaited answers.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/33/9780061015533.jpg', 'title_long': "Playing My Mother's Blues", 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 264, 'date_published': '2007-01-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', 'Psychological', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Black & African American', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Valerie Wilson Wesley'], 'title': "Playing My Mother's Blues", 'isbn13': '9780061015533', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061015539', 'isbn10': '0061015539'}}
