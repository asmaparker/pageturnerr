{'book': {'publisher': 'Gardners Books', 'synopsis': "Lestat is back with a vengeance and in thrall to Rowan Mayfair. Both demon and angel, he is drawn to kill but tempted by goodness as he moves among the pantheon of Anne Rice's unforgettable characters. Julien Mayfair, his tormentor; Rowan, witch and neurosurgeon, who attracts spirits to herself, casts spells on others and finds herself dangerously drawn to Lestat; Patsy, country and western singer, who was killed by Quinn Blackwood and dumped in a swamp; Ash Templeton, a 5,000 year old Taltos whose genes live on in the Mayfairs. Now, Lestat fights to save Patsy's ghost from the dark realms of the Earthbound, to uncover the mystery of the Taltos and to decide the fate of Rowan Mayfair. Both of Anne Rice's irresistible realms - the worlds of Blackwood Farm and the Mayfair Witches - collide as Lestat struggles between his lust for blood and the quest for life, between gratification and redemption.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/76/9780099460176.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blood Canticle', 'edition': 'New Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.3307 Inches, Weight: 0.49383546688 Pounds, Width: 0.94488 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.3307}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.94488}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49383546688}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.00786}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Anne Rice'], 'title': 'Blood Canticle', 'isbn13': '9780099460176', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099460173', 'isbn10': '0099460173'}}
