But recently the pollution from the outside world has grown ever greater, and young Gary Gar, latest in a long line of gargoyle guardians, is finding it ever more difficult to fulfill his responsibilities.<br/><br/>So Gary does what any sensible Xanth resident with a dire dilemma would do. He goes to see the Good Magician Humfrey, who sends him on a peculiar quest--to transform himself into human shape, tutor a precocious child with more than her share of wild magical talents, and find a philter which can restore the river to its previous pristine state.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/56/9780812534856.jpg', 'title_long': 'Geis of the Gargoyle (Xanth, No. 18)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.74 Inches, Length: 4.28 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.895 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.28}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.895}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.74}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '1995-10-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Piers Anthony'], 'title': 'Geis of the Gargoyle (Xanth, No. 18)', 'isbn13': '9780812534856', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0812534859', 'isbn10': '0812534859'}}
