{'book': {'publisher': 'Wildside Press', 'synopsis': 'Anna, miserable in a loveless marriage, succumbs to the desire for the dashing Vronsky. That sort of thing didn\'t stand one in good stead in 19th-century Russia; bad goes to worse and the end Anna comes to is the stuff of legend. Tolstoy seamlessly captures a weaves a tapestry of Russian society -- as Matthew Arnold wrote in his celebrated essay on Tolstoy, "We are not to take Anna Karenina as a work of art; we are to take it as a piece of life."<br/>The novel remains popular, as demonstrated by a 2007 poll of 125 contemporary authors in Time, which declared that Anna Karenina is the "greatest book ever written." Anna Karenina may be the greatest single novel ever written; it may also be just plainly and sublimely good. Regardless, there is no doubt that Anna Karenina (generally considered Tolstoy\'s finest novel) is a sublime achievement.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/12/9780809596812.jpg', 'title_long': 'Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, Fiction, Classics, Literary', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 2.71829969046 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.71829969046}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 740, 'date_published': '2004-01-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Leo Tolstoy'], 'title': 'Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, Fiction, Classics, Literary', 'isbn13': '9780809596812', 'msrp': 59.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0809596814', 'isbn10': '0809596814'}}
