How can we name what poets do in order to inform our writing, our teaching?<br/>In their staff development work with teachers, Nick Flynn and Shirley McPhillips have often encountered these and similar questions. This book invites preservice and inservice teachers, staff developers - anyone who wants to make a lasting place for poetry in their own and their students' lives - into many of these same primary through middle school classrooms for an up-close look at several thoughtful, rigorous, poetry inquiries.<br/>Each chapter begins with a mentor poem as the centerpiece for discussion, followed by a short narrative of ways the authors view their world through that chapter's particular poetic lens. The authors then walk the reader into a classroom writer's workshop where, through vignettes, conversations, and carefully designed mini-lessons, that chapter's key element of poetic practice is being studied over time.<br/>Other aspects that will help teachers in designing and conducting inquiry around mentor poems include:mini-lessons that take students through an inquiry from launch to in-depth extensions;illustrations of student writing samples in the try it stages, successive drafts, and crafted poems;words, stories, and examples of best-loved poets that inspire and instruct us in our own thinking and teaching;appendixes that include various types of book lists, charts, conference transcripts, and additional poems.<br/>A Note Slipped Under the Door will show how you might help your student writers let the poems they love teach them what they need to know, and build a writing life that includes finding and crafting their own.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/08/9781571103208.jpg', 'title_long': 'Note Slipped Under the Door, A: Teaching from Poems We Love', 'edition': '49473rd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 1.11553904572 Pounds, Width: 0.63 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.63}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.11553904572}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2000-01-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Certification & Development', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Nick Flynn', 'Shirley McPhillips'], 'title': 'Note Slipped Under the Door, A: Teaching from Poems We Love', 'isbn13': '9781571103208', 'msrp': 19.55, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1571103201', 'isbn10': '1571103201'}}
