{'book': {'publisher': 'Continuum', 'synopsis': "Central to The Guerilla Film Makers Movie Blueprint are flow charts: crystal-clear diagrams detailing every single thing, no matter how small, that needs to be done to make your film. This visual approach to the filmmaking process ensures that new (and established!) filmmakers get an instant overview of each and every discipline. Backing up the diagrams are copious notes - humorous in tone, yet broad and deep in content. Wherever possible, the text is broken apart into box outs, hot tips and sub-diagrams. This book is entertaining, irreverent, and never less than painfully practical. The Guerilla Film Makers Movie Blueprint will have its own dedicated website where readers can download the tools, forms, software, and artwork detailed in the book. Jones's latest endeavor is packed with over a decade's worth of experience, know-how, and insider tips. A must-read for every budding filmmaker.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/33/9780826414533.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Guerilla Film Makers Movie Blueprint', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 3.8 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 640, 'date_published': '2003-06', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Direction & Production', 'Video', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture'], 'authors': ['Chris Jones'], 'title': 'The Guerilla Film Makers Movie Blueprint', 'isbn13': '9780826414533', 'msrp': 46.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0826414532', 'isbn10': '0826414532'}}
