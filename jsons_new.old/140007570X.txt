{'book': {'publisher': 'Anchor', 'synopsis': "Fans around the world adore the bestselling No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency series and its proprietor, Precious Ramotswe, Botswana’s premier lady detective. In this charming series, Mma Ramotswe—with help from her loyal associate, Grace Makutsi—navigates her cases and her personal life with wisdom, good humor, and the occasional cup of tea.<br/><br/>Precious is busier than usual at the detective agency when she discovers an intruder in her house on Zebra Drive—and perhaps even more baffling—a pumpkin on her porch. Her associate, Mma Makutsi, also has a full plate. She's taken up dance lessons, only to be partnered with a man with two left feet. And at Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, where Mr J.L.B. Matekoni is already overburdened with work, one of his apprentices has run off with a wealthy older woman. But what finally rattles Mma Ramotswe’s normally unshakable composure is a visitor who forces her to confront a difficult secret from her past.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/06/9781400075706.jpg', 'title_long': "In The Company Of Cheerful Ladies - The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Book 6", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.04 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.4625 Pounds, Width: 0.55 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.55}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4625}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.04}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2006-03-14', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Alexander McCall Smith'], 'title': "In The Company Of Cheerful Ladies - The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Book 6", 'isbn13': '9781400075706', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '140007570X', 'isbn10': '140007570X'}}
