{'book': {'publisher': 'Elloras Cave Pub Inc', 'synopsis': "Two opposite men, two different lives, two sets of past lies. With his twenty-year high-school reunion looming, Paul Loughton dreads seeing the one person who could tempt him to stray from his path. Small-town mayor, lawyer and budding politician, Paul can't - won't - admit he's gay, even to himself. Years of denial and lies are now threatened by an inevitable encounter. With his denial slipping, he has to come face-to-face with temptation. Randy Martin left his small-town roots behind before the ink on his diploma was dry. The cliquish world of his childhood didn't have room for the weird kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Rumors of his sexual preferences made life that much more difficult. Now, twenty years later, he should be anxious to rub his wealth and success in the faces of his former classmates. Except with one of them, the urge to rub something else hasn't diminished over the years.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/65/9781419953965.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wicked Sacrifice (Books 4 and 5)', 'dimensions': 'height: 210 mm, length: 133 mm, width: 25 mm, weight: 408 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 133}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 408}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 210}}, 'pages': 290, 'date_published': '2009-09-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary', 'Erotica'], 'authors': ['Lora Leigh'], 'title': 'Wicked Sacrifice (Books 4 and 5)', 'isbn13': '9781419953965', 'msrp': 13.75, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1419953966', 'isbn10': '1419953966'}}
