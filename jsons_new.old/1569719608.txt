{'book': {'publisher': 'Dark Horse', 'synopsis': "For most of the 20th century, the work of cartoonist and graphic novelist Will Eisner defined the art of comic book storytelling in the U.S. and throughout the world. This hardcover collection of Eisner's gorgeous pencil sketches and groundbreaking designs is a must-have for any pop-culture enthusiasts and fans of comic books. Culled from many decades' worth of work, the Sketchbook presents the world as seen through Will Eisner's eyes, with introductory notes for each of the eleven sections. From his observations of his friends and loved ones hustling through their daily lives to witnessing those quiet moments when no one is supposed to be watching, Eisner's keen perception and steadfast hand capture the essence of what it means to be a true artist.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/02/9781569719602.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Will Eisner Sketchbook - New Edition', 'edition': 'New Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.75 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 3.4 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.75}}, 'pages': 200, 'date_published': '2004-02-03', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Individual Artists', 'Collections, Catalogs & Exhibitions', 'Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse', 'How To Create Comics & Manga', 'Art of Comics and Manga', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Will Eisner'], 'title': 'The Will Eisner Sketchbook - New Edition', 'isbn13': '9781569719602', 'msrp': 24.18, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1569719608', 'isbn10': '1569719608'}}
