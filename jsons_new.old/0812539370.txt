{'book': {'publisher': 'Tor Books', 'synopsis': "Callahan's Crosstime Saloon is the neighborhood tavern to all of time and space, where the regulars are anything but: time travelers, talking dogs, alcoholic vampires, cybernetic aliens--and a group of people who really, truly care about each other. It's the rare kind of place where bad pun are as appreciated as good conversation.<br/><br/>Time Travelers Strictly Cash is their policy, but then again everybody pays cash at Callahan's. Lay your money on the bar, name your poison, step up to the line drawn on the barroom floor, and after drinking make a toast and throw the glass into the fireplace. It's an odd tradition (don't worry about the cost--Callahan gets the glasses at a bulk discount), but one's that's led to some interesting stories.<br/><br/>Callahan's Secret may be something even the regulars would never guess. then again, it may be as simple as listening to those post-toast stories. After-all, like Callahan says, shared pain is lessened and shared joy in increased--a simple concept that could, after a few drinks, lead to saving the world....<br/><br/>This omnibus edition contains the trio of books that introduced the world to Mike Callahan, Jake Stonebender, Doc Webster, Mickey Finn, Fast Eddie Costigan, Long-Drink McGonnigle, Ralph Won Wau Wau and the rest of the regulars of Callahan's Place in the stories that helped Spider Robinson to win both a John W. Campbell Award and a legion of fans.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/70/9780812539370.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Callahan Chronicals', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.92 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.6503636729 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.24}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6503636729}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.92}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '1997-10-15', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure'], 'authors': ['Spider Robinson'], 'title': 'The Callahan Chronicals', 'isbn13': '9780812539370', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0812539370', 'isbn10': '0812539370'}}
