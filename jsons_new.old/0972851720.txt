{'book': {'publisher': 'Temenos Press', 'synopsis': "The delightful story of creative play with miniature figures and magical worlds on the nursery floor is brought back to life in this reprint of a historical work. Written for his sons in 1911, Wells's story immerses the reader in a tale where possibilities are the given and surprises the fact. It has since been used as a teaching tool for psychotherapists the world over to understand children's methods of thinking and is instrumental in the work of sandplay therapists. An insightful introduction discusses the history of play in Wells's prolific creative life and his role in the development of sandplay therapy.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/25/9780972851725.jpg', 'title_long': "H.
