{'book': {'publisher': '"Harry N. Abrams, Inc."', 'synopsis': "Henri Rousseau (1844-1910) was a self-taught artist with a unique style, exemplified in his visionary jungle scenes. These dream-like tableaux, for which he drew heavily on visits to Paris' Botanical Gardens, captivate with the lushness of their plant and animal life, while unsettling the viewer with their heady combination of exoticism and romanticism.<br/><br/>This sumptuously illustrated book provides not only a comprehensive overview of Rousseau's career, but also penetrating insights into his inspiration. With large, color reproductions of his paintings, many previously unpublished illustrations of his sources and influences, and a wealth of new research on his life and work (including the only interview conducted with the artist), Henri Rousseau: Jungles in Paris<br/><br/>is poised to become the definitive volume on this remarkable painter.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/95/9780810956995.jpg', 'title_long': 'Henri Rousseau: Jungles in Paris', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 11 Inches, Weight: 3.5 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2006-04-01', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Individual Artists', 'History & Criticism', 'History', 'Painting'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Henri Rousseau: Jungles in Paris', 'isbn13': '9780810956995', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0810956993', 'isbn10': '0810956993'}}
