{'book': {'publisher': 'Scholastic Press', 'synopsis': "The pioneering team that brought you Caldecott Honor Book The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins lends their vision, flair, and unique style to Walt Whitman--poet, American icon, Civil War hero.<br/>Did you know that poet Walt Whitman was also a Civil War nurse? Devastated by his country dividing and compelled to service by his brother's war injury, Walt nursed all soldiers--Union and Confederate, black and white. By getting to know them through many intense and affecting experiences, he began to see a greater life purpose: His writing could give these men a voice, and in turn, achieve his highest aspiration--to capture the true spirit of America. Dramatic, powerful, and deeply moving, this consummate portrait of Whitman will inspire readers to pick up their pens and open their hearts to humanity.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/13/9780439357913.jpg', 'title_long': 'Walt Whitman: Words for America', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 12 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 1.17 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.17}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 12}}, 'pages': 56, 'date_published': '2004-10-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'History', 'United States', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Biographies', 'Literary', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World', 'Multicultural Stories'], 'authors': ['Barbara Kerley'], 'title': 'Walt Whitman: Words for America', 'isbn13': '9780439357913', 'msrp': 19.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0439357918', 'isbn10': '0439357918'}}
