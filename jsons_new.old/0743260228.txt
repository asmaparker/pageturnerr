Expecting to assume ownership of Triumph Ranch, the couple instead learns that their deed is a fake, and that they must work for the rightful proprietors to earn their keep. Resourceful Elizabeth trades her trousseau—including the fine quilts stitched by her Bergstrom relatives—for the practical goods the Nelsons need to survive, and finds friendship with California native Rosa Diaz Barclay. When Elizabeth discovers a mysterious cache of quilts made by a member of the Diaz family that reveals a misplaced legacy of love, land, and ancestral ties, it becomes clear that only by stitching the rift between the past and the future can the inhabitants of Triumph Ranch hope to live in peace alongside history.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/20/9780743260220.jpg', 'title_long': "The Quilter's Homecoming (Elm Creek Quilts Series, Book 10)", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2007-04-10', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jennifer Chiaverini'], 'title': "The Quilter's Homecoming (Elm Creek Quilts Series, Book 10)", 'isbn13': '9780743260220', 'msrp': 24, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0743260228', 'isbn10': '0743260228'}}
