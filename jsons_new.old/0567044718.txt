{'book': {'publisher': 'T&T Clark', 'synopsis': "For over one hundred years International Critical Commentaries have had a special place among works on the Bible. They bring together all the relevant aids to exegesis - linguistic, textual, archaeological, historical, literary, and theological - to help the reader understand the meaning of the books of the Old and New Testaments.<br/><br/>The new commentaries continue this tradition. All new evidence now available is incorporated and new methods of study are applied. The authors are of the highest international standing.<br/><br/>No attempt has been made to secure a uniform theological or critical approach to the biblical text: contributors have been invited for their scholarly distinction, not for their adherence to any one school of thought.<br/><br/>Robert McL. Wilson's commentary on Colossians and Philemon is now made more widely available in this new paperback edition.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/16/9780567044716.jpg', 'title_long': 'Colossians and Philemon (International Critical Commentary)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.38450300536 Pounds, Width: 1.0618089 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.0618089}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.38450300536}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2005-12-07', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Bible Study & Reference', 'Bible Study', 'Criticism & Interpretation', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Robert McL Wilson'], 'title': 'Colossians and Philemon (International Critical Commentary)', 'isbn13': '9780567044716', 'msrp': 160, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0567044718', 'isbn10': '0567044718'}}
