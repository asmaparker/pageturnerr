This book is an insider's guide to these little understood topics.Author Jeremy Zawodny has managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!, maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of their own tools in order to produce the information in this book.In High Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life environments. And you'll learn the supporting techniques you need to carry out these tasks, including advanced configuration, benchmarking, and investigating logs.Topics include: A review of configuration and setup options Storage engines and table types Benchmarking Indexes Query Optimization Application Design Server Performance Replication Load-balancing Backup and Recovery Security", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/67/9780596003067.jpg', 'title_long': 'High Performance MySQL', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.19 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 1.0802650838 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.83}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.0802650838}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.19}}, 'pages': 265, 'date_published': '2004-04-18', 'subjects': ['SQL', 'General', 'Databases', 'COM021000', 'cs.cmp_sc.app_sw.db'], 'authors': ['Jeremy D.
