{'book': {'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'synopsis': "The thirteen short stories in this volume were written between 1924 and 1928, and are set in Europe and America. Eleven were collected in The Woman Who Rode Away (1928), though 'The Man Who Loved Islands' appeared in the American edition only and the other two in The Lovely Lady (1933). An unpublished fragment 'A Pure Witch' is also included here. The stories reflect Lawrence's experiences in New Mexico, Mexico, Italy, Germany and England in the post-war period. Many were considerably revised by Lawrence after he first wrote them; some were completely rewritten and subsequently published in different versions. The editors give composition histories and discuss publication difficulties, including Compton Mackenzie's objections to 'The Man Who Loved Islands'. Appendices record manuscript revisions for three stories and give complete, unpublished early versions of four. Explanatory notes elucidate literary allusions and give topographical and biographical information.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/00/9780521294300.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Woman Who Rode Away and Other Stories (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D.
