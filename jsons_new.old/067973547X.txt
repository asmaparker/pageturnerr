{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "With a foreword by Oliver Sacks<br/><br/>Shortly after John Hull went blind, after years of struggling with failing vision, he had a dream in which he was trapped on a sinking ship, submerging into another, unimaginable world. The power of this calmly eloquent, intensely perceptive memoir lies in its thorough navigation of the world of blindnessâ€”a world in which stairs are safe and snow is frightening, where food and sex lose much of their allure and playing with one's child may be agonizingly difficult. As he describes the ways in which blindness shapes his experience of his wife and children, of strangers helpful and hostile, and, above all, of his God, Hull becomes a witness in the highest, true sense. Touching the Rock is a book that will instruct, move, and profoundly transform anyone who reads it.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/72/9780679735472.jpg', 'title_long': 'Touching the Rock: An Experience of Blindness', 'edition': '1st Vintage Books ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.02 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.16}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.02}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '1992-06-02', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'People with Disabilities', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'Social Activists', 'Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'Humor & Satire', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['John M.
