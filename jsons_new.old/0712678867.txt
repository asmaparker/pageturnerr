Workers make decisions previously made by their bosses. Managerial staff set their own salaries and bonuses. Everyone has access to the company books. No formality - a minimum of meetings, memos and approvals. Internal walls are torn down. Shopfloor workers set their own productivity targets and schedules. Result - Semco is one of Latin America's fastest-growing companies, acknowledged to be the best in Brazil to work for, and with a waiting list of thousands of applicants waiting to join it. Learn Ricardo's secrets and let some of the Semco magic rub off on you and your company.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/65/9780712678865.jpg', 'title_long': "Maverick : The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace", 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.51588169308 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7874}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.51588169308}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 332, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Business & Money'], 'authors': ['Ricardo Semler'], 'title': "Maverick : The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace", 'isbn13': '9780712678865', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0712678867', 'isbn10': '0712678867'}}
