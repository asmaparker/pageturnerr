{'book': {'publisher': 'Arcadia Publishing', 'synopsis': 'Florida\'s first theme park, Cypress Gardens, was the brainchild of Richard Downing Dick" Pope Sr. With his wife, Julie Downing Pope, he transformed a marshy, lakeside property in Winter Haven into a magnificent garden. The park\'s first visitors in 1936 toured pathways surrounded by lush plants from around the world. Two years later, electric boats meandered through the park\'s winding, hand-dug canals. Water ski shows commenced in 1942, and the park became the "Water Ski Capital of the World." The Florida-shaped Esther Williams Swimming Pool still graces the shore of Lake Eloise. The park was a set for dozens of short feature films, a stage for beauty pageants, and a site for special television broadcasts. A butterfly garden, zoo, rides, and the small-town Southern Crossroads shopping and dining area remain popular features. Kent Buescher purchased Cypress Gardens in 2004, and today\'s expanded Cypress Gardens Adventure Park preserves the family-friendly appeal of Dick and Julie Pope\'s magnificent park."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/90/9780738543390.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cypress Gardens, FL (Images of America)', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.72 Pounds, Width: 0.31 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.72}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2006-11-21', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Photography & Video', 'Travel', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Specialty Travel', 'Tourist Destinations & Museums', 'Adventure', 'Theme Parks'], 'authors': ['Mary M.
