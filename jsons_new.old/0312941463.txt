HOT STUFF introduces Cate Madigan, a Boston native from a large and crazy Irish family. Cate has far too much going on to get involved in extracurricular activities, like men and marriage. She spends all day in school, earning her teaching degree, and all night working as a bartender in Boston's South End. Ex-cop Kellen McBride has decided to make Cate's bar his nightly haunt. He likes Cate's sassy Irish spirit and wild red hair. He also has an ulterior motive for getting close to her. Cate has sworn off all things romantic, but when she comes home to a ransacked apartment, a roommate who has flown the coop, and a sleeping bullmastiff named Beast, Cate has no choice but to ask Kellen for help. Can Kate resist the charming Kellen McBride while keeping herself out of danger? Or will Kellen turn up the heat on Cate and everything in her life?<br/><br/>We know you'll have a blast with HOT STUFF!<br/><br/>Janet Evanovich & Leanne Banks", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/68/9780312941468.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hot Stuff', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.69 Pounds, Width: 0.6440932 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6440932}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.69}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2007-04-03', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Mystery', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Cozy', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Janet Evanovich', 'Leanne Banks'], 'title': 'Hot Stuff', 'isbn13': '9780312941468', 'msrp': 8.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0312941463', 'isbn10': '0312941463', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781429927994', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
