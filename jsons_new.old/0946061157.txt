{'book': {'publisher': 'Rebel Pr', 'synopsis': "First published in 1974, 'Leaving..' was the first collection of Situationist writing in English. Chris Gray, its editor, was himself a member of the SI. Long out of print, it has gained an enormous reputation. This new, lavish, oversize edition, keeps the original provocative, and free and easy translations, along with the cut and paste graphics, poster-art and cartoons. It stands as a remarkable, and eminently accessible, introduction to a remarkable (and oft-times superficially at least, inaccessible) revolutionary project. Now as we stand at the gates of the 21st century, it is time for a new generation of readers to take up this remarkable book.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/50/9780946061150.jpg', 'title_long': 'Leaving the 20th Century: The Incomplete Work of the Situationist International', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.25 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.38 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.38}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.25}}, 'pages': 136, 'date_published': '1998-04-20', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Political', 'Politics & Government'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Leaving the 20th Century: The Incomplete Work of the Situationist International', 'isbn13': '9780946061150', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0946061157', 'isbn10': '0946061157'}}
