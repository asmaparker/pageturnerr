The sprawling ruin is empty now, and the bulldozers have come to raze it. But as they do, a terrifying secret begins to emerge.<br/><br/>The body in Claudia Olsen's grave is that of a stranger who died horribly. This much Louis Kincaid knows. But what happened to the woman who should be buried there? It's a question no one will answer, one that leads Kincaid to the long, dark tunnels below the asylum and crimes of unimaginable depravity. . .<br/><br/>Now, in a place where the walls are stained with secrets, the air thick with the lingering history of screams, Louis Kincaid is on his darkest journey yet, matching wits with a monster whose work will not be silenced. . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/75/9780786016075.jpg', 'title_long': 'AN Unquiet Grave (Louis Kincaid)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.8 Inches, Length: 4.18 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.15 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.18}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.15}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.8}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006-02-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Private Investigators', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['P.J.
