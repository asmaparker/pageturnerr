Frustrated by this facade he must put up with and stifled by a future already laid out for him, the only way Yutaka can deal with the boredom and unhappiness of his empty life is through sexual release. Then one day, Tohno ― a delinquent-looking student with blonde-dyed hair ― suddenly transfers into Yutaka's class.
