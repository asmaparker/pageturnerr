{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': 'Cornelius von Baerle lives only to cultivate the elusive black tulip and win a magnificent prize for its creation. But when his powerful godfather is assassinated, the unwitting Cornelius becomes caught up in a deadly political intrigue. Falsely accused of high treason by a bitter rival, Cornelius is condemned to life in prison. His only comfort is Rosa, the jailer\'s beautiful daughter, who helps him concoct a plan to grow the black tulip in secret. As Robin Buss explains in his informative introduction, Dumas infuses his story with elements from the history of the Dutch Republic (including two brutal murders) and Holland\'s seventeenth-century "tulipmania" phenomenon.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
