But when the flashy, womanizing, multimillion-dollar personal injury lawyer is caught offering bribes, he's forced to wear a wire. Even as the besieged attorney looks after his ailing wife, Feaver must also make tapes that will hurl his friends, his enemies, his city, and a particular FBI undercover agent into a crisis of conscience and law. Now Robbie Feaver is making the play of his life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/02/9780446608602.jpg', 'title_long': 'Personal Injuries', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.125 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '2000-12-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Legal', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Scott Turow'], 'title': 'Personal Injuries', 'isbn13': '9780446608602', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0446608602', 'isbn10': '0446608602'}}
