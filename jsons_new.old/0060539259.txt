There is also a prophetic note in Wright\'s construction of the criminal mind as intelligent, introspective, and transformative."<br/>In addition to the Introduction by Maryemma Graham, this edition includes a notes section by Arnold Rampersad.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/52/9780060539252.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Outsider', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 629, 'date_published': '2003-07-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Richard Wright'], 'title': 'The Outsider', 'isbn13': '9780060539252', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060539259', 'isbn10': '0060539259'}}
