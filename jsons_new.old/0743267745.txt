{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster', 'synopsis': "The beloved author of Forever Fifty and Suddenly Sixty tackles the ins and outs of becoming a septuagenarian with wry good humor. Fans of Viorst’s funny, touching, and wise decades poems will love these verses filled with witty advice and reflections on marriage, milestones, and middle-aged children.<br/><br/>Viorst explores, among the many other issues of this stage of life, the state of our sex lives and teeth, how we can stay married though thermostatically incompatible, and the joys of grandparenthood and shopping. Readers will nod with rueful recognition when she asks, “Am I required to think of myself as a basically shallow woman because I feel better when my hair looks good?,” when she presses a few helpful suggestions on her kids because “they may be middle aged, but they’re still my children,” and when she graciously—but not too graciously—selects her husband’s next mate in a poem deliciously subtitled “If I Should Die Before I Wake, Here’s the Wife You Next Should Take.” Though Viorst acknowledges she is definitely not a good sport about the fact that she is mortal, her poems are full of the pleasures of life right now, helping us come to terms with the passage of time, encouraging us to keep trying to fix the world, and inviting us to consider “drinking wine, making love, laughing hard, caring hard, and learning a new trick or two as part of our job description at seventy.”<br/><br/>I'm Too Young to Be Seventy is a joy to read and makes a heartwarming gift for anyone who has reached or is soon to reach that—it’s not so bad after all—seventh decade.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/48/9780743267748.jpg', 'title_long': "I'm Too Young To Be Seventy: And Other Delusions (Judith Viorst's Decades)", 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.51 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.51}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 64, 'date_published': '2005-10-12', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Limericks & Humorous Verse', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Women Authors', 'Reference'], 'authors': ['Judith Viorst'], 'title': "I'm Too Young To Be Seventy: And Other Delusions (Judith Viorst's Decades)", 'isbn13': '9780743267748', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '1416588558'}, 'isbn': '0743267745', 'isbn10': '0743267745', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416588559', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
