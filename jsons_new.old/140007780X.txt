{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A modern classic explores the connections between science and art, the process of creativity, and ultimately the fragility of human existence.<br/><br/>“A magical, metaphysical realm ... Captivating, enchanting, delightful.” —The New York Times<br/><br/>Einstein’s Dreams is a fictional collage of stories dreamed by Albert Einstein in 1905, about time, relativity and physics. As the defiant but sensitive young genius is creating his theory of relativity, a new conception of time, he imagines many possible worlds. In one, time is circular, so that people are fated to repeat triumphs and failures over and over. In another, there is a place where time stands still, visited by lovers and parents clinging to their children. In another, time is a nightingale, sometimes trapped by a bell jar.<br/><br/>Now translated into thirty languages, Einstein’s Dreams has inspired playwrights, dancers, musicians, and painters all over the world. In poetic vignettes, it explores the connections between science and art, the process of creativity, and ultimately the fragility of human existence.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/09/9781400077809.jpg', 'title_long': "Einstein's Dreams", 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.19 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.41 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.41}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.98}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '2004-11-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Alan Lightman'], 'title': "Einstein's Dreams", 'isbn13': '9781400077809', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '140007780X', 'isbn10': '140007780X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307789747', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
