My murderer was a man from our neighborhood. My mother liked his border flowers, and my father talked to him once about fertilizer.<br/><br/>This is Susie Salmon, speaking from heaven - which looks a lot like her school playground, with the good kind of swing sets, counsellors to help newcomers adjust, and friends to room with.
