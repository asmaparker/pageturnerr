He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane. Now his daughter is about to marry, and his wife is thinking about leaving him. But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage. With the memories of Noah and Allie's inspiring life together as his guide, he vows to find a way to make his wife fall in love with him...all over again.<br/><br/>In this powerfully moving tale of love lost, rediscovered, and renewed, Nicholas Sparks once again brings readers his unique insight into the only emotion that ultimately really matters.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/60/9780446615860.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Wedding', 'edition': '1st ptg.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.32 Pounds, Width: 0.875 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.875}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.32}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2005-08-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Small Town & Rural', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Nicholas Sparks'], 'title': 'The Wedding', 'isbn13': '9780446615860', 'msrp': 5.59, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0446615862', 'isbn10': '0446615862'}}
