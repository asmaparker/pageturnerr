{'book': {'publisher': 'Atria', 'synopsis': 'From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Other Boleyn Girl comes the final book of the extraordinary Wideacretrilogy as the heir to the great estate comes home at last.<br/><br/>Meridon knows she does not belong in the dirty, vagabond life of a gypsy bareback rider. The half-remembered vision of another life burns in her heart, even as her beloved sister, Dandy, risks everything for their future. Alone, Meridon follows the urgings of her dream, riding in the moonlight past the rusted gates, up the winding drive to a house—clutching the golden clasp of the necklace that was her birthright—home at last to Wideacre. The lost heir of one of England’s great estates would take her place as its mistress...<br/><br/>Meridon is a rich, impassioned tapestry of a young woman’s journey from dreams to glittering drawing rooms and elaborate deceits, from a simple hope to a deep and fulfilling love. Set in the savage contrasts of Georgian England—a time alive with treachery, grandeur, and intrigue—Meridon is Philippa Gregory’s masterwork.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/17/9780743249317.jpg', 'title_long': 'Meridon (The Wideacre Trilogy)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.03 Pounds, Width: 1.44 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.44}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.03}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 576, 'date_published': '2003-07-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', "Women's Fiction", 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Philippa Gregory'], 'title': 'Meridon (The Wideacre Trilogy)', 'isbn13': '9780743249317', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1416588590'}, 'isbn': '0743249313', 'isbn10': '0743249313', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416588597', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
