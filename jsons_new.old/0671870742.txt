{'book': {'publisher': 'Touchstone', 'synopsis': 'With more than 100,000 copies in print, Living with the Passive-Aggressive Man draws on case histories from clinical psychologist Scott Wetzler’s practice to help you identify the destructive behavior, the root causes and motivations, and solutions.<br/><br/>Do you know one of these men?<br/><br/>The catch-me-if-you-can lover...<br/><br/>Phil’s romantic and passionate one minute, distant and cold the next.<br/><br/>The deviously manipulative coworker or boss...<br/><br/>Jack denies resenting Nora’s rapid rise in the company, but when they’re assigned to work together on a project, he undermines her.<br/><br/>The obstructionist, procrastinating husband...<br/><br/>Bob keeps telling his wife he’ll finish the painting job he began years ago, but he never seems to get around to it.<br/><br/>These are all classic examples of the passive-aggressive man. This personality syndrome—in which hostility wears a mask of passivity—is currently the number one source of men’s problems in relationships and on the job. In Living with the Passive-Aggressive Man, Scott Wetzler draws upon numerous case histories from his own practice to explain how and why the passive-aggressive man thinks, feels, and acts the way he does. Dr. Wetzler also offers advice on:<br/><br/>• How to avoid playing victim, manager, or rescuer to the “P-A”<br/>• How to get his anger and fear into the open<br/>• How to help the “P-A” become a better lover, husband, and father<br/>• How to survive passive-aggressive game playing on the job<br/><br/>Living with a man’s passive aggression can be an emotional seesaw ride. But armed with this book, you can avoid the bumpy landings.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/44/9780671870744.jpg', 'title_long': 'Living with the Passive-Aggressive Man: Coping with Hidden Aggression - From the Bedroom to the Boardroom', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.52}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.440924524}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4375}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '1993-10-01', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Codependency', 'Conflict Management', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Communication & Social Skills', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Counseling', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Conflict Resolution', 'Parenting', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cognitive Psychology'], 'authors': ['Scott Wetzler'], 'title': 'Living with the Passive-Aggressive Man: Coping with Hidden Aggression - From the Bedroom to the Boardroom', 'isbn13': '9780671870744', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '145164017X'}, 'isbn': '0671870742', 'isbn10': '0671870742', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781451640175', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
