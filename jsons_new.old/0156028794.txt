Read it.” — Washington Post<br/>A genuinely brilliant novel.” — Chicago Tribune<br/><br/>Cipriano Algor, an elderly potter, lives with his daughter Marta and her husband Marçal in a small village on the outskirts of The Center, an imposing complex of shops and apartments to which Cipriano delivers his wares. One day, he is told not to make any more deliveries. Unwilling to give up his craft, Cipriano tries his hand at making ceramic dolls. Astonishingly, The Center places an order for hundreds. But just as suddenly, the order is canceled and the penniless three have to move from the village into The Center. When mysterious sounds of digging emerge from beneath their new apartment, Cipriano and Marçal investigate; what they find transforms the family’s life. Filled with the depth, humor, and extraordinary philosophical richness that marks all of Saramago’s novels, The Cave is one of the essential books of our time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/90/9780156028790.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Cave', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2003-10-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopian', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['José Saramago'], 'title': 'The Cave', 'isbn13': '9780156028790', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0547537980'}, 'isbn': '0156028794', 'isbn10': '0156028794', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547537986', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
