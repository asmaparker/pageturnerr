{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "From the acclaimed Nobel Prize winner: At the close of the 17th century, Iceland is an oppressed Danish colony, suffering under extreme poverty, famine, and plague. A farmer and accused cord-thief named Jon Hreggvidsson makes a bawdy joke about the Danish king and soon after finds himself a fugitive charged with the murder of the king’s hangman.<br/><br/>In the years that follow, the hapless but resilient rogue Hreggvidsson becomes a pawn entangled in political and personal conflicts playing out on a far grander scale. Chief among these is the star-crossed love affair between Snaefridur, known as “Iceland’s Sun,” a beautiful, headstrong young noblewoman, and Arnas Arnaeus, the king’s antiquarian, an aristocrat whose worldly manner conceals a fierce devotion to his downtrodden countrymen. As their personal struggle plays itself out on an international stage, Laxness creates a Dickensian canvas of heroism and venality, violence and tragedy, charged with narrative enchantment on every page.<br/><br/>Sometimes grim, sometimes uproarious, and always captivating, Iceland's Ball is at once an updating of the traditional Icelandic saga and a caustic social satire.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/53/9781400034253.jpg', 'title_long': "Iceland's Bell", 'edition': '4th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.94 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.72 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.16}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.93}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.72}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.94}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2003-10-14', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Halldor Laxness'], 'title': "Iceland's Bell", 'isbn13': '9781400034253', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307426319', 'ePub': '0307426319'}, 'isbn': '1400034256', 'isbn10': '1400034256', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307426314', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
