Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay still as death. But beneath the foliage a malevolent presence stirred and sent the ten-year-old Ivan scrambling for the safety of Cousin Marek's farm.<br/><br/>Now, years later, Ivan is an American graduate student, engaged to be married. Yet he cannot forget that long-ago day in the forest—or convince himself it was merely a frightened boy’s fantasy. Compelled to return to his native land, Ivan finds the clearing just as he left it.<br/><br/>This time he does not run. This time he awakens the beauty with a kiss . . . and steps into a world that vanished a thousand years ago.<br/><br/>A rich tapestry of clashing worlds and cultures, Enchantment is a powerfully original novel of a love and destiny that transcend centuries . . . and the dark force that stalks them across the ages.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/02/9780345482402.jpg', 'title_long': 'Enchantment: A Classic Fantasy with a Modern Twist', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.4 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.9}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2005-05-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Romance', 'Classics', 'Mythology & Folk Tales', 'Folklore', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Romantic', 'Travel', 'Europe', 'Belarus & Ukraine'], 'authors': ['Orson Scott Card'], 'title': 'Enchantment: A Classic Fantasy with a Modern Twist', 'isbn13': '9780345482402', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0345484509'}, 'isbn': '0345482409', 'isbn10': '0345482409', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780345484505', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
