{'book': {'publisher': 'National Geographic Kids', 'synopsis': "Freedom Riders compares and contrasts the childhoods of John Lewis and James Zwerg in a way that helps young readers understand the segregated experience of our nation's past. It shows how a common interest in justice created the convergent path that enabled these young men to meet as Freedom Riders on a bus journey south.<br/><br/>No other book on the Freedom Riders has used such a personal perspective. These two young men, empowered by their successes in the Nashville student movement, were among those who volunteered to continue the Freedom Rides after violence in Anniston, Alabama, left the original bus in flames with the riders injured and in retreat. Lewis and Zwerg joined the cause knowing their own fate could be equally harsh, if not worse. The journey they shared as freedom riders through the Deep South changed not only their own lives but our nation's history.<br/><br/>National Geographic supports K-12 educators with ELA Common Core Resources.<br/>Visit www.natgeoed.org/commoncore for more information.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/37/9780792241737.jpg', 'title_long': 'Freedom Riders: John Lewis and Jim Zwerg on the Front Lines of the Civil Rights Movement', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.19 Inches, Length: 8.82 Inches, Weight: 1.38 Pounds, Width: 0.47 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.82}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.47}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.38}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.19}}, 'pages': 80, 'date_published': '2005-12-27', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'History', 'United States', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Biographies', 'Multicultural', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Multicultural Stories', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Ann Bausum'], 'title': 'Freedom Riders: John Lewis and Jim Zwerg on the Front Lines of the Civil Rights Movement', 'isbn13': '9780792241737', 'msrp': 16.2, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0792241738', 'isbn10': '0792241738'}}
