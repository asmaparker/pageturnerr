{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster', 'synopsis': "The first major biography of the Carter Family, the musical pioneers who almost single-handedly created the sounds and traditions that grew into modern folk, country, and bluegrass music.<br/><br/>Meticulously researched and lovingly written, it is a look at a world and a culture that, rather than passing, has continued to exist in the music that is the legacy of the Cartersâ€”songs that have shaped and influenced generations of artists who have followed them.<br/><br/>Brilliant in insight and execution, Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone? is also an in-depth study of A.P., Sara, and Maybelle Carter, and their bittersweet story of love and fulfillment, sadness and loss. The result is more than just a biography of a family; it is also a journey into another time, almost another world, and theirs is a story that resonates today and lives on in the timeless music they created.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/27/9780743243827.jpg', 'title_long': "Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone?
