{'book': {'publisher': 'Anchor', 'synopsis': 'PULITZER PRIZE WINNER • NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A "powerful and poignant" twentieth-century reimagining of Shakespeare’s King Lear (The New York Times Book Review) that takes on themes of truth, justice, love, and pride—and centers on a wealthy Iowa farmer who decides to divide his farm between his three daughters.<br/><br/>When the youngest daughter objects, she is cut out of his will. This sets off a chain of events that brings dark truths to light and explodes long-suppressed emotions. Ambitiously conceived and stunningly written, A Thousand Acres reveals the beautiful yet treacherous topography of humanity.<br/><br/>“A family portrait that is also a near-epic investigation into the broad landscape, the thousand dark acres of the human heart.... The book has all the stark brutality of a Shakespearean tragedy.” —The Washington Post Book World', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/36/9781400033836.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Thousand Acres: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.17 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.17}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.84}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.98}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Jane Smiley'], 'title': 'A Thousand Acres: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9781400033836', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307787710', 'ePub': '0307787710'}, 'isbn': '1400033837', 'isbn10': '1400033837', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307787712', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
