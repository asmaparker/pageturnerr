But on his way to the Big Leagues, Ron stumbled, his dreams broken by drinking, drugs, and women. Then, on a winter night in 1982, not far from Ron’s home, a young cocktail waitress named Debra Sue Carter was savagely murdered. The investigation led nowhere. Until, on the flimsiest evidence, it led to Ron Williamson. The washed-up small-town hero was charged, tried, and sentenced to death—in a trial littered with lying witnesses and tainted evidence that would shatter a man’s already broken life, and let a true killer go free.<br/><br/>Impeccably researched, grippingly told, filled with eleventh-hour drama, The Innocent Man reads like a page-turning legal thriller. It is a book no American can afford to miss.<br/><br/>Don’t miss John Grisham’s new book, THE EXCHANGE: AFTER THE FIRM!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/32/9780385517232.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.52 Inches, Length: 6.47 Inches, Weight: 1.48 Pounds, Width: 1.23 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.47}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.23}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.52}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2006-10-10', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Murder & Mayhem', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Law', 'Criminal Law', 'Law Enforcement', 'Specialties', 'Legal History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['John Grisham'], 'title': 'The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town', 'isbn13': '9780385517232', 'msrp': 30, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0385517238', 'isbn10': '0385517238', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307576019', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
