A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was the Great Depression and for Jacob the circus was both his salvation and a living hell. There he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but brutal animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an untrainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this group of misfits was one of love and trust, and ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/05/9781565125605.jpg', 'title_long': 'Welcome to Your Brain: Why You Lose Your Car Keys but Never Forget How to Drive and Other Puzzles of Everyday Life', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.62 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.62}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2008-03-04', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Science & Math', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine', 'Psychology'], 'authors': ['Sandra Aamodt', 'Sam Wang'], 'title': 'Welcome to Your Brain: Why You Lose Your Car Keys but Never Forget How to Drive and Other Puzzles of Everyday Life', 'isbn13': '9781565125605', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1565125606', 'isbn10': '1565125606', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781565125858', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
