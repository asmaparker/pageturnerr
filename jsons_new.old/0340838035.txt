{'book': {'publisher': 'Hodder & Stoughton', 'synopsis': "For eighteen years the Hartes and the Golds have lived next door to each other, sharing everything from Chinese food to chicken pox to carpool duty - they've grown so close it seems they have always been a part of each other's lives. Parents and children alike have been best friends, so it's no surprise that in high school Chris and Emily's friendship blossoms into something more. After all, they've been soul mates since they were born.<br/>So when midnight calls from the hospital come in, no one is prepared: Emily is dead at seventeen from a gunshot wound to the head, inflicted by Chris as part of an apparent suicide pact. He tells police the next bullet was meant for himself. A local detective has her doubts. And the Hartes and Golds must face every parent's worst nightmare and question: do we ever really know our children at all?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/37/9780340838037.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Pact', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.37795 Inches, Length: 4.99999 Inches, Weight: 0.78484565272 Pounds, Width: 7.79526 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.99999}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.78484565272}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.37795}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Jodi Picoult'], 'title': 'The Pact', 'isbn13': '9780340838037', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0340838035', 'isbn10': '0340838035'}}
