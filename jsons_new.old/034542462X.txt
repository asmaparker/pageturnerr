{'book': {'publisher': 'Del Rey', 'synopsis': "Thousands of years ago, the mad emperor Lokan controlled the Nightsword--and imposed his twisted desires on all that lived. Then Lokan mysteriously vanished behind the Maelstrom Wall, into the quantum chaos of the galactic core. But legend says that somewhere behind the Wall, the Nightsword is hidden, its awesome energies waiting to be used again . . . for good or evil.<br/><br/>When Earther astronaut Jeremy Griffiths donned the Mantle of Kendis-Dai and became blessed--and perhaps cursed--with infinite knowledge, he learned the exact direction of Lokan's ill-fated route. And now the secrets stored in his head have made him the target of everyone who has ever coveted the Nightsword for their own ends. Griffiths wants only to get his crew safely home to Earth--and to impress the bewitching, bewildering Merinda Neskat. Yet he is caught firmly in the middle of galactic agendas beyond his control, and this new quest will prove to be the challenge of a lifetime . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/24/9780345424624.jpg', 'title_long': 'Nightsword: A Starshield Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.5 Inches, Weight: 0.29982867632 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.29982867632}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}}, 'pages': 404, 'date_published': '1999-08-03', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic'], 'authors': ['Margaret Weis', 'Tracy Hickman'], 'title': 'Nightsword: A Starshield Novel', 'isbn13': '9780345424624', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '034542462X', 'isbn10': '034542462X'}}
