{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster', 'synopsis': 'When the low-budget biker movie Easy Rider shocked Hollywood with its success in 1969, a new Hollywood era was born. This was an age when talented young filmmakers such as Scorsese, Coppola, and Spielberg, along with a new breed of actors, including De Niro, Pacino, and Nicholson, became the powerful figures who would make such modern classics as The Godfather, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, and Jaws. Easy Riders, Raging Bulls follows the wild ride that was Hollywood in the \'70s -- an unabashed celebration of sex, drugs, and rock \'n\' roll (both onscreen and off) and a climate where innovation and experimentation reigned supreme. Based on hundreds of interviews with the directors themselves, producers, stars, agents, writers, studio executives, spouses, and ex-spouses, this is the full, candid story of Hollywood\'s last golden age.<br/>MARTIN SCORSESE ON DRUGS: "I did a lot of drugs because I wanted to do a lot, I wanted to push all the way to the very very end, and see if I could die."<br/>DENNIS HOPPER ON EASY RIDER: "The cocaine problem in the United States is really because of me. There was no cocaine before Easy Rider on the street. After Easy Rider, it was everywhere."<br/>GEORGE LUCAS ON STAR WARS: "Popcorn pictures have always ruled. Why do people go see them? Why is the public so stupid? That\'s not my fault."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/84/9780684857084.jpg', 'title_long': "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'N' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood", 'edition': 'Later Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.07365121594 Pounds, Width: 1.28 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.28}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.07365121594}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4375}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '1999-04-04', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Business & Money', 'Industries', 'Sports & Entertainment', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Direction & Production', 'History & Criticism', 'Reference', 'Screenwriting', 'Video'], 'authors': ['Peter Biskind'], 'title': "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'N' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood", 'isbn13': '9780684857084', 'msrp': 13.11, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Paperback': '1439126615', 'ePub': '1439126615'}, 'isbn': '0684857081', 'isbn10': '0684857081', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781439126615', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
