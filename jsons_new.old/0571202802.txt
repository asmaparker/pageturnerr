{'book': {'publisher': 'Faber & Faber', 'synopsis': "An intimate look at the films of Terry Gilliam, visionary director and animator<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam is a famously candid commentator on his own work, and in these specially recorded interviews, he reflects on how his Midwestern childhood and early career as an animator--including his work as the only American member of Monty Python--prepared him to undertake his extraordinary adventures in cinema.<br/><br/>His films are distinctively dark, fantastic, and strangely hilarious. From the medieval mock-epic Monty Python and the Holy Grail to the mythic, paranoid worlds of The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Gilliam has pursued a totally personal, uncompromising vision. This has led to legendary battles with studios and financiers, notably over The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Brazil, which is now widely considered a classic.<br/><br/>The book includes Gilliam's storyboards for the films--a unique glimpse at his creative process--along with his original cartoons and black-and-white photographs throughout.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/05/9780571202805.jpg', 'title_long': 'Gilliam on Gilliam', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.84657508608 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.84657508608}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2000-06-15', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Direction & Production', 'Video'], 'authors': ['Terry Gilliam'], 'title': 'Gilliam on Gilliam', 'isbn13': '9780571202805', 'msrp': 4.07, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0571202802', 'isbn10': '0571202802'}}
