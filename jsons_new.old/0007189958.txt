From naughty children to rebellious teenagers, Rosie and Alex have stuck by each other through thick and thin. But just as they're discovering the joys of teenage nights on the town and dating disasters, they're separated. Alex's family moves from Dublin to America -- and Alex goes with them. For good. Rosie's lost without her best friend. But on the eve of her departure to join Alex in Boston, Rosie gets news that will change her life forever -- and keep her at home in Ireland. Their magical connection sees them through the ups and downs of each other's lives but neither of them knows whether their friendship can really survive the years and miles -- as well as new relationships. And at the back of Rosie's mind is whether they were meant to be more than just good friends all along. Misunderstandings, circumstances and sheer bad luck have kept them out of each others' arms, but when presented with the ultimate opportunity, will they gamble everything -- including their friendship -- for true love? Destiny, Alex and Rosie discover, is a funny thing and fate isn't quite done with them yet...", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/53/9780007189953.jpg', 'title_long': 'Where Rainbows End', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.21258 Inches, Length: 6.02361 Inches, Weight: 1.50134800422 Pounds, Width: 1.33858 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.02361}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.33858}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.50134800422}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.21258}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Cecelia Ahern'], 'title': 'Where Rainbows End', 'isbn13': '9780007189953', 'msrp': 22.7, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0007189958', 'isbn10': '0007189958'}}
