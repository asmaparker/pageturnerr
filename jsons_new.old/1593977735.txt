{'book': {'publisher': 'Macmillan Audio', 'synopsis': 'Cannell delivers non-stop action and intrigue in the latest installment of his New York Times bestselling Shane Scully series<br/>Shane Scully and his partner are assigned to the case of “the Fingertip Killer”—a serial murderer preying on homeless veterans in Los Angeles. Every two weeks he strikes: he beats his victims, then shoots them in the back of the head. Once they’re dead, he cuts off their fingertips, closes their eyes, and tosses them in the river.<br/><br/>The latest killing, however, does not quite fit the pattern. It appears to be the work of the Fingertip Killer, but Scully suspects an elaborate copycat murder meant to hide a criminal conspiracy. A bullet pulled from the victim’s skull produces what police call a “cold hit,” an unexpected ballistics match linking one unsolved case to another, and the previous victim was an LA Police officer, killed ten years earlier.<br/><br/>After heavy-handed FBI agents throw him off the Fingertip Killer case, Scully teams up with his wife and boss, Alexa, and a pair of tough cops from the LAPD’s anti-terrorism squad. Outside the law and deep undercover, they fight to see justice done for the slain officer, and, possibly, to unravel a murderous plot with connections high up in the Homeland Security office.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/33/9781593977733.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cold Hit: A Shane Scully Novel (Shane Scully Novels)', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.7 Inches, Length: 5.24 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 1.295 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.24}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.295}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.58}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.7}}, 'pages': 11, 'date_published': '2005-08-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors': ['Stephen J.
