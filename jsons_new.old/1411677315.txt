{'book': {'publisher': 'Lulu Press', 'synopsis': "Late night shots ring out in tranquil Hermosa Beach, California, heralding the mysterious assassination of a nondescript pussycat. Will the trail lead to an enigmatic code hidden in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci? Will a breathless race through the streets of Los Angeles lead back to Hermosa, where an explosive truth, contemplated for centuries, is finally unveiled as the Formula for God - reconciling religion's compatibility with physics? Well, no to the first question, and as for the second question, well, I guess it's all a question of faith. Nevertheless, conquer your own fear and loathing of fake memoirs and take a wild ride with the most original voice to come along in years. Truth is stranger than fiction; so much so, that sometimes it has to be toned down and just called fiction.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/19/9781411677319.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Million Little Pieces of Feces', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.01573 Inches, Length: 5.98424 Inches, Weight: 0.85098433132 Pounds, Width: 0.5885815 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.98424}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5885815}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85098433132}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.01573}}, 'pages': 260, 'date_published': '2006-02-10', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous'], 'authors': ['Python Bonkers'], 'title': 'A Million Little Pieces of Feces', 'isbn13': '9781411677319', 'msrp': 18.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1411677315', 'isbn10': '1411677315'}}
