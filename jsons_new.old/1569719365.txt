She was soon cloistered away in a local convent, but by her fourteenth year word of her beauty had spread - and those who would prey upon her faced unforeseen consequences.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/67/9781569719367.jpg', 'title_long': 'Creatures Of The Night', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.78 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.78}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.75}}, 'pages': 48, 'date_published': '2005-01-04', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Neil Gaiman'], 'title': 'Creatures Of The Night', 'isbn13': '9781569719367', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1569719365', 'isbn10': '1569719365'}}
