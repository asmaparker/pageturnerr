Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each readers understanding of these enduring works. The Complete Sherlock Holmes comprises four novels and fifty-six short stories revolving around the world’s most popular and influential fictional detective—the eccentric, arrogant, and ingenious Sherlock Holmes. He and his trusted friend, Dr. Watson, step from Holmes’s comfortable quarters at 221b Baker Street into the swirling fog of Victorian London to combine detailed observation and vast knowledge with brilliant deduction. Inevitably, Holmes rescues the innocent, confounds the guilty, and solves the most perplexing puzzles known to literature. Volume II of The Complete Sherlock Holmes begins with The Return of Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, tired of writing about Holmes, had killed him off at the end of “The Final Problem,” the last tale in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (found in Volume I of The Complete Sherlock Holmes). Public demand for new Holmes stories was so great, however, that Conan Doyle eventually resurrected him. The first story in The Return, “The Adventure of the Empty House,” features Conan Doyle’s infamously inventive explanation of how Holmes escaped what seemed like certain death. This volume also includes two other collections of Holmes stories, His Last Bow and The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes; Conan Doyle’s final full-length Holmes novel, The Valley of Fear; a pair of parodies, “The Field Bazaar” and “How Watson Learned the Trick”; and two essays about the “private life” of the beloved sleuth.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/02/9781593080402.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Complete Sherlock Holmes, Volume II (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.1875 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 752, 'date_published': '2003-10-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives'], 'authors': ['Sir Arthur Conan Doyle'], 'title': 'The Complete Sherlock Holmes, Volume II (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)', 'isbn13': '9781593080402', 'msrp': 11.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1593080409', 'isbn10': '1593080409', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781411431980', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
