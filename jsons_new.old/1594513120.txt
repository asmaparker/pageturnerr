{'book': {'publisher': 'Routledge', 'synopsis': 'The volatile Middle East is the site of vast resources, profound passions, frequent crises, and long-standing conflicts, as well as a major source of international tensions and a key site of direct US intervention. Two of the most astute analysts of this part of the world are Noam Chomsky, the preeminent critic of U.S, foreign policy, and Gilbert Achcar, a leading specialist of the Middle East who lived in that region for many years. In their new book, Chomsky and Achcar bring a keen understanding of the internal dynamics of the Middle East and of the role of the United States, taking up all the key questions of interest to concerned citizens, including such topics as terrorism, fundamentalism, conspiracies, oil, democracy, self-determination, anti-Semitism, and anti-Arab racism, as well as the war in Afghanistan, the invasion and occupation of Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the sources of U.S. foreign policy. This book provides the best readable introduction for all who wish to understand the complex issues related to the Middle East from a perspective dedicated to peace and justice.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/21/9781594513121.jpg', 'title_long': 'Perilous Power: The Middle East & U.S. Foreign Policy: Dialogues on Terror, Democracy, War, and Justice', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.24781640292 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.24781640292}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2006-09-15', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'International & World Politics', 'Political Science', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Noam Chomsky', 'Gilbert Achcar'], 'title': 'Perilous Power: The Middle East & U.S. Foreign Policy: Dialogues on Terror, Democracy, War, and Justice', 'isbn13': '9781594513121', 'msrp': 25.88, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1594513120', 'isbn10': '1594513120', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781317254300', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
