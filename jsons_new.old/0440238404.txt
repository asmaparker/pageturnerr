{'book': {'publisher': 'Laurel Leaf', 'synopsis': 'ALA Popular Paperback For Young Adults<br/><br/>New York Public Library Books for the Teen Age<br/><br/>Bank Street Best Children\'s Books of the Year<br/><br/>Jasmine "Jazz" Gardner heads off to India during the monsoon season. The family trip is her mother\'s doing: Mrs. Gardner wants to volunteer at the orphanage that cared for her when she was young. But going to India isn\'t Jazz\'s idea of a great summer vacation. She wants no part of her mother\'s do-gooder endeavors.<br/><br/>What\'s more, Jazz is heartsick. She\'s leaving the business she and her best friend, Steve Morales, started--as well as Steve himself. Jazz is crazy in love with the guy. If only he knew!<br/><br/>Only when Jazz reluctantly befriends Danita, a girl who cooks for her family, and who faces a tough dilemma, does Jazz begin to see how she can make a difference--to her own family, to Danita, to the children at the orphanage, even to Steve. As India claims Jazz, the monsoon works its madness and its magic.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/09/9780440238409.jpg', 'title_long': 'Monsoon Summer', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.92 Inches, Length: 5.53 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.53}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.92}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2006-04-11', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors': ['Mitali Perkins'], 'title': 'Monsoon Summer', 'isbn13': '9780440238409', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307433579'}, 'isbn': '0440238404', 'isbn10': '0440238404', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307433572', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
