{'book': {'publisher': "HarperCollins Children's Books", 'synopsis': "Everyone laughs when Horton the Elephant offers to sit on Mayzie bird's egg while she goes on holiday. Horton's kindness and faithfulness are sorely tested when he, and the egg, are kidnapped and sold to a circus -- but his reward for being faithful is more wonderful than he could ever have dreamed! With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr Suess has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic Cat in the Hat, and ranked among the UK's top ten favourite children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide. As part of a major rebrand programme, HarperCollins is relaunching Dr Seuss's best-selling books. In response to consumer demand, bright new cover designs incorporate much-needed guidance on reading levels. The standard paperbacks divide into three reading strands -- Blue Back Books for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. This is a Yellow Back book.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/92/9780007175192.jpg', 'title_long': 'Horton Hatches the Egg Yellow Back Book', 'edition': 'Rebranded ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.85825 Inches, Length: 6.41731 Inches, Weight: 0.3086471668 Pounds, Width: 0.15748 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.41731}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.15748}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3086471668}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.85825}}, 'pages': 64, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Classics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Anthologies', 'Regional & Cultural'], 'authors': ['Dr Seuss'], 'title': 'Horton Hatches the Egg Yellow Back Book', 'isbn13': '9780007175192', 'msrp': 10.35, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0007175191', 'isbn10': '0007175191'}}
