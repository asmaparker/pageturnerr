Still smarting from a weapons-trade gone bad and a double-cross, Cabrillo takes action. He manages to save the beautiful Sloane Macintyre, who's on a mission of her own, looking for a long-submerged ship that may hold a fortune in diamonds. But what surprises Cabrillo is her story about a crazy fisherman who claims to have been attacked on the open sea by giant metal snakes in the same area.<br/><br/>What begins as a snake hunt leads Cabrillo onto the trail of a far more lethal quarry—a deranged militant and his followers who plan to unleash the devastating power of nature itself against all who oppose them.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/92/9780425211892.jpg', 'title_long': 'Skeleton Coast (The Oregon Files)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Sea Stories', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Sea Adventures', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Clive Cussler', 'Jack Du Brul'], 'title': 'Skeleton Coast (The Oregon Files)', 'isbn13': '9780425211892', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1101205539', 'ePub': '1101205539'}, 'isbn': '0425211894', 'isbn10': '0425211894', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101205532', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
