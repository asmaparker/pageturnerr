In his singular voice and with a novelist's gift for detail, Jimmy Carter creates a sensitive portrait of an era that shaped the nation and recounts a classic, American story of enduring importance.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/94/9780743211994.jpg', 'title_long': 'an-hour-before-daylight', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 0.91932763254 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91932763254}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Presidents & Heads of State', 'Memoirs', 'Regional U.S.', 'South', 'History', 'Americas'], 'authors': ['jimmy-carter'], 'title': 'an-hour-before-daylight', 'isbn13': '9780743211994', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'related': {'ePub': '074321725X'}, 'isbn': '0743211995', 'isbn10': '0743211995', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780743217255', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
