{'book': {'publisher': 'Providence Forum Press', 'synopsis': 'What sets "George Washington\'s Sacred Fire" apart from all previous works on this man for the ages, is the exhaustive fifteen years of Dr. Peter Lillback\'s research, revealing a unique icon driven by the highest of ideals. Only do George Washington\'s own writings, journals, letters, manuscripts, and those of his closest family and confidants reveal the truth of this awe-inspiring role model for all generations. Dr. Lillback paints a picture of a man, who, faced with unprecedented challenges and circumstances, ultimately drew upon his persistent qualities of character - honesty, justice, equity, perseverence, piety, forgiveness, humility, and servant leadership, to become one of the most revered figures in world history. George Washington set the cornerstone for what would become one of the most prosperous, free nations in the history of civilization. Through this book, Dr. Lillback, assisted by Jerry Newcombe, will reveal to the reader a newly inspirational image of General and President George Washington.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/61/9780978605261.jpg', 'title_long': "George Washington's Sacred Fire", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 3.1 Pounds, Width: 2.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 2.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 1208, 'date_published': '2006-07-24', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Presidents & Heads of State'], 'authors': ['Peter A.
