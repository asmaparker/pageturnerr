Nor does his father, Tilden, a hulking former All-American footballer, or his uncle, who has lost one of his legs to a chain saw. Only the memory of an unwanted child, buried in an undisclosed location, can hope to deliver this family from its sin.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/77/9780307274977.jpg', 'title_long': 'Buried Child', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.24912235606 Pounds, Width: 0.34 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.34}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.24912235606}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.9}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2006-02-14', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Dysfunctional Families', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Rural', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Sam Shepard'], 'title': 'Buried Child', 'isbn13': '9780307274977', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307494276'}, 'isbn': '0307274977', 'isbn10': '0307274977', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307494276', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
