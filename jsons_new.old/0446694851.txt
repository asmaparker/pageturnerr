{'book': {'publisher': 'Grand Central Publishing', 'synopsis': "In this New York Times bestseller, follow the author of The Notebook as he travels the world with his brother learning about faith, loss, connection, and hope.<br/><br/>As moving as his bestselling works of fiction, Nicholas Sparks's unique memoir, written with his brother, chronicles the life-affirming journey of two brothers bound by memories, both humorous and tragic. In January 2003, Nicholas Sparks and his brother, Micah, set off on a three-week trip around the globe. It was to mark a milestone in their lives, for at thirty-seven and thirty-eight respectively, they were now the only surviving members of their family.<br/><br/>Against the backdrop of the wonders of the world and often overtaken by their feelings, daredevil Micah and the more serious, introspective Nicholas recalled their rambunctious childhood adventures and the tragedies that tested their faith. And in the process, they discovered startling truths about loss, love, and hope.<br/><br/>Narrated with irrepressible humor and rare candor, and including personal photos, Three Weeks with My Brother reminds us to embrace life with all its uncertainties . . . and most of all, to cherish the joyful times, both small and momentous, and the wonderful people who make them possible.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/58/9780446694858.jpg', 'title_long': 'Three Weeks with My Brother', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.125 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2006-01-03', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Siblings', 'Travel', 'Travel Writing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Nicholas Sparks', 'Micah Sparks'], 'title': 'Three Weeks with My Brother', 'isbn13': '9780446694858', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0446694851', 'isbn10': '0446694851'}}
