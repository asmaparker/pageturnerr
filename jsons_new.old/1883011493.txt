{'book': {'publisher': 'Library of America', 'synopsis': 'This adventurous two-volume collection presents a rich vein of modern American writing too often neglected in mainstream literary histories. Evolving out of the terse and violent hardboiled style of the pulp magazines, noir fiction expanded over the decades into a varied and innovative body of writing. Tapping deep roots in the American literary imagination, the novels in this volume explore themes of crime, guilt, deception, obsessive passion, murder, and the disintegrating psyche. With visionary and often subversive force they create a dark and violent mythology out of the most commonplace elements of modern life. The raw power of their vernacular style has profoundly influenced contemporary American culture and writing.<br/><br/>LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/99/9781883011499.jpg', 'title_long': 'Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s: The Killer Inside Me / The Talented Mr. Ripley / Pick-up / Down There / The Real Cool Killers (Library of America)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.1 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 1.28749961008 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.28749961008}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.1}}, 'pages': 892, 'date_published': '1997-09-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jim Thompson', 'Robert Polito', 'Patricia Highsmith', 'charles Willeford', 'David Goodis', 'Chester Himes'], 'title': 'Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s: The Killer Inside Me / The Talented Mr. Ripley / Pick-up / Down There / The Real Cool Killers (Library of America)', 'isbn13': '9781883011499', 'msrp': 35, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1883011493', 'isbn10': '1883011493'}}
