At the story’s center stands the intellectual and idealistic Dorothea Brooke―a character who in many ways resembles Eliot herself. But the very qualities that set Dorothea apart from the materialistic, mean-spirited society around her also lead her into a disastrous marriage with a man she mistakes for her soul mate. In a parallel story, young doctor Tertius Lydgate, who is equally idealistic, falls in love with the pretty but vain and superficial Rosamund Vincy, whom he marries to his ruin. &&LP&&REliot surrounds her main figures with a gallery of characters drawn from every social class, from laborers and shopkeepers to the rising middle class to members of the wealthy, landed gentry. Together they form an extraordinarily rich and precisely detailed portrait of English provincial life in the 1830s. But Dorothea’s and Lydgate’s struggles to retain their moral integrity in the midst of temptation and tragedy remind us that their world is very much like our own. Strikingly modern in its painful ironies and psychological insight, &&LI&&RMiddlemarch&&L/I&&R was pivotal in the shaping of twentieth-century literary realism. &&L/P&&R&&LP&&R&&LB&&RLynne Sharon Schwartz&&L/B&&R is the author of fourteen books of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, including the novels &&LI&&RDisturbances in the Field, Leaving Brooklyn&&L/I&&R, and &&LI&&RIn the Family Way&&L/I&&R, and the memoir &&LI&&RRuined by Reading&&L/I&&R.
