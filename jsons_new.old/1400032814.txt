{'book': {'publisher': 'Anchor', 'synopsis': 'Misty Wilmot has had it. Once a promising young artist, she’s now stuck on an island ruined by tourism, drinking too much and working as a waitress in a hotel. Her husband, a contractor, is in a coma after a suicide attempt, but that doesn’t stop his clients from threatening Misty with lawsuits over a series of vile messages they’ve found on the walls of houses he remodeled.<br/><br/>Suddenly, though, Misty finds her artistic talent returning as she begins a period of compulsive painting. Inspired but confused by this burst of creativity, she soon finds herself a pawn in a larger conspiracy that threatens to cost hundreds of lives. What unfolds is a dark, hilarious story from America’s most inventive nihilist, and Palahniuk’s most impressive work to date.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/15/9781400032815.jpg', 'title_long': 'Diary: A Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.47 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.23}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.47}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.96}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2004-09-14', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Suspense', 'Supernatural', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Chuck Palahniuk'], 'title': 'Diary: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9781400032815', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '140009531X'}, 'isbn': '1400032814', 'isbn10': '1400032814', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781400095315', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
