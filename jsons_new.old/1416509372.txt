{'book': {'publisher': 'Baen', 'synopsis': 'Honor Harrington in trouble: Having made him look the fool, she\'s been exiled to Basilisk Station in disgrace and set up for ruin by a superior who hates her. Her demoralized crew blames her for their ship\'s humiliating posting to an out-of-the-way picket station. The aborigines of the system\'s only habitable planet are smoking homicide-inducing hallucinogens. Parliament isn\'t sure it wants to keep the place; the major local industry is smuggling, the merchant cartels want her head; the star-conquering, so-called "Republic" of Haven is Up to Something; and Honor Harrington has a single, over-age light cruiser with an armament that doesn\'t work to police the entire star system. But the people out to get her have made one mistake. They\'ve made her mad!This special limited edition includes an excerpt from the next Honor Harrington best seller, At All Costs (hitting bookstore shelves November 2005)!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/93/70/9781416509370.jpg', 'title_long': 'On Basilisk Station (Honor Harrington Book 1)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 464, 'date_published': '2005-07-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera'], 'authors': ['David Weber'], 'title': 'On Basilisk Station (Honor Harrington Book 1)', 'isbn13': '9781416509370', 'msrp': 3.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '1416509372', 'isbn10': '1416509372'}}
