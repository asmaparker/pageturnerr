{'book': {'publisher': 'Lyons Press', 'synopsis': '"I hope The Long Walk will remain as a memorial to all those who live and die for freedom, and for all those who for many reasons could not speak for themselves."--Slavomir Rawicz<br/><br/>In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labor camp in Yakutsk--a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday feats. Their march--over thousands of miles by foot--out of Siberia, through China, the Gobi Desert, Tibet, and over the Himalayas to British India is a remarkable statement about man\'s desire to be free.<br/><br/>While the original book sold hundreds of thousands of copies, this updated paperback version includes a new Afterword by the author, as well as the author\'s Foreword to the Polish book. Written in a hauntingly detailed, no holds barred way, the new edition of The Long Walk is destined to outrank its classic status and guaranteed to forever stay in the reader\'s mind. *** Six-time Academy Award–nominee Peter Weir (Master and Commander, The Truman Show, and The Dead Poets Society) recently directed The Way Back, a much-anticipated film based on The Long Walk. Starring Colin Farrell, Jim Sturgess, and Ed Harris, it is due for release in 2011.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/48/9781592289448.jpg', 'title_long': 'Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom', 'edition': 'New edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.88 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.88}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2006-04-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'World War II', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Slavomir Rawicz'], 'title': 'Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom', 'isbn13': '9781592289448', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1592289444', 'isbn10': '1592289444'}}
