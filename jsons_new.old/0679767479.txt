The narrator is the elderly Victor Maskell, formerly of British intelligence, for many years art expert to the Queen. Now he has been unmasked as a Russian agent and subjected to a disgrace that is almost a kind of death. But at whose instigation?<br/><br/>As Maskell retraces his tortuous path from his recruitment at Cambridge to the airless upper regions of the establishment, we discover a figure of manifold doubleness: Irishman and Englishman; husband, father, and lover of men; betrayer and dupe. Beautifully written, filled with convincing fictional portraits of Maskell\'s co-conspirators, and vibrant with the mysteries of loyalty and identity, The Untouchable places John Banville in the select company of both Conrad and le Carre.<br/><br/>"Victor Maskell is one of the great characters in recent fiction.... The Untouchable is the best work of art in any medium on [its] subject." —Washington Post Book World<br/><br/>"As remarkable a literary voice as any to come out of Ireland; Joyce and Beckett notwithstanding." —San Francisco Chronicle', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/73/9780679767473.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Untouchable', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.16 Inches, Weight: 0.61 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.16}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.61}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 367, 'date_published': '1998-06-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'War', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['John Banville'], 'title': 'The Untouchable', 'isbn13': '9780679767473', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307560929'}, 'isbn': '0679767479', 'isbn10': '0679767479', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307560926', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
