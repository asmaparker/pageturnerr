{'book': {'publisher': 'Crossway', 'synopsis': 'John Barrett, anchorman for the city\'s most-watched newscast, is a man suddenly lost in a town he thought he owned. His comfortable world is being jarred to the breaking point.<br/>He\'s caught his producer fabricating a story and lying to cover her tracks-and she seems to be hiding something much bigger. His supposedly professional and objective colleagues have descended into a dogfight over the meaning of truth. His father\'s "accidental" death suddenly isn\'t looking so accidental. And John\'s estranged son, Carl, has returned to get the truth about the man behind the TV image. All of these events pale in comparison to the mysterious voices that John is hearing.<br/>Master storyteller Frank Peretti has woven a powerful tale. Prophet has all the hallmarks of Peretti\'s fast-paced blockbuster fiction, and his clear understanding of the vast spiritual struggle over moral authority marks every page.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/61/9781581345261.jpg', 'title_long': 'Prophet', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.84437046346 Pounds, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.84437046346}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2004-03-11', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Religious'], 'authors': ['Frank E.
