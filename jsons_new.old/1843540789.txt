{'book': {'publisher': 'Atlantic Books', 'synopsis': '"K is a famous writer living in Tokyo with his wife and three children, the oldest of whom was born with a brain anomaly that has left him mentally disabled. A highly cerebral man who often retreats from real life into abstraction - in this case, the poetry of William Blake - K is confronted by his wife with the reality that this child, Eeyore, has been saying and doing disturbing things - behaving aggressively, asserting that he\'s dead, even brandishing a knife at his mother. As the days pass, various events - K\'s hapless attempts to communicate with his son, Eeyore\'s near drowning during a father-son trip to the swimming pool, a terrible hurricane that nearly destroys the family\'s mountain cottage and the family inside it - K is forced to question his fitness as a father." K reconsiders his own life - his relationship with his father, his rural upbringing, his relationship with a well-known dissident writer who committed suicide, the responsibilities of artists and writers in Japan generally. In the end, in part through his obsessive rereading of Blake, K is able to see that things are not always what they seem, especially where his son is concerned, and to trust his heart as well as his mind.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/86/9781843540786.jpg', 'title_long': 'Rouse Up, O Young Men of the New Age', 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Kenzaburo Oe'], 'title': 'Rouse Up, O Young Men of the New Age', 'isbn13': '9781843540786', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1843540789', 'isbn10': '1843540789'}}
