{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': "Although Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) created a wide range of poetry, essays, and fairy tales (and one novel) in his brief, tragic life, he is perhaps best known as a dramatist. His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.<br/>An Ideal Husband revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards — providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.<br/>Like most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895 debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years later. An Ideal Husband is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless sophistication.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/32/9780486414232.jpg', 'title_long': 'An Ideal Husband (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.14991433816 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.14991433816}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '2001-02-05', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Parodies', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'United States', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Oscar Wilde'], 'title': 'An Ideal Husband (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)', 'isbn13': '9780486414232', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0486131203', 'eBook': '0486131203', 'ePub': '0486131203'}, 'isbn': '048641423X', 'isbn10': '048641423X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486131207', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
