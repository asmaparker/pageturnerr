{'book': {'publisher': 'Mariner Books', 'synopsis': 'In this daring and provocative literary parody which has captured the interest and imagination of a nation, Alice Randall explodes the world created in GONE WITH THE WIND, a work that more than any other has defined our image of the antebellum South. Taking sharp aim at the romanticized, whitewashed mythology perpetrated by this southern classic, Randall has ingeniously conceived a multilayered, emotionally complex tale of her own - that of Cynara, the mulatto half-sister, who, beautiful and brown and born into slavery, manages to break away from the damaging world of the Old South to emerge into full life as a daughter, a lover, a mother, a victor. THE WIND DONE GONE is a passionate love story, a wrenching portrait of a tangled mother-daughter relationship, and a book that "celebrates a people\'s emancipation not only from bondage but also from history and myth, custom and stereotype" (San Antonio Express-News).', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/63/9780618219063.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Wind Done Gone: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.616 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.616}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2002-04-08', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Alice Randall'], 'title': 'The Wind Done Gone: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780618219063', 'msrp': 12.51, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0547524935'}, 'isbn': '0618219064', 'isbn10': '0618219064', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547524931', 'binding': 'saleableprint'}]}}
