{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Amelia Cynster is stunned to hear these words from Lucien Ashford—the enigmatic sixth Viscount Calverton and the man she has always loved—just before the handsome rogue passes out at her feet. Dawn is breaking and she's already risked scandal by lying in wait for him just outside his London home. And though torn between indignant affront and astonished relief, she's nevertheless thrilled that Luc has agreed to her outrageous marriage proposal.<br/>However, rather than submitting to a hasty wedding as Amelia had planned, the exasperating lord insists on wooing her properly…in public and in private. She longs for their time alone, when she can learn all about seduction from a master, yet frustratingly, they all too often find themselves beneath the stifling gaze of the ton.<br/>But there is method behind the viscount's madness—he has a secret reason for wooing Amelia. And like all desirable things, his passion has a price.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/53/9780060002053.jpg', 'title_long': 'On a Wicked Dawn (Cynster Novels, 9)', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.44533376924 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.44533376924}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2002-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'American', 'Scottish', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Stephanie Laurens'], 'title': 'On a Wicked Dawn (Cynster Novels, 9)', 'isbn13': '9780060002053', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '006175384X', 'ePub': '006175384X'}, 'isbn': '0060002050', 'isbn10': '0060002050', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061753848', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
