And in 2004, five-time champion Lance Armstrong set out to achieve what no other cyclist in the 100-year history of the race had ever done: win a sixth Tour de France.Armstrong had four serious challengers who wanted nothing more than to deny the man the French call Le Boss from achieving his goal. The major threat among them was the only other former Tour de France champion in last year's race, Germany's Jan Ullrich- The Kaiser. But when the race was over, Lance Armstrong once again wore the yellow jersey of victory.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/56/9780306814556.jpg', 'title_long': "23 Days in July: Inside the Tour de France and Lance Armstrong's Record-Breaking Victory", 'edition': 'First Thus', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 344, 'date_published': '2005-06-15', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Individual Sports', 'Cycling'], 'authors': ['John Wilcockson'], 'title': "23 Days in July: Inside the Tour de France and Lance Armstrong's Record-Breaking Victory", 'isbn13': '9780306814556', 'msrp': 11.9, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0306814552', 'isbn10': '0306814552'}}
