{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "From the bestselling, award-winning author of The Year of Magical Thinking and Let Me Tell You What I Mean—a gorgeously written, bitterly funny look at the relationship between politics and personal life.<br/><br/>Moving deftly between romance, farce, and tragedy, from 1970s America to Vietnam to Jakarta, Democracy is a tour de force from a writer who can dissect an entire society with a single phrase.<br/><br/>Inez Victor knows that the major casualty of the political life is memory. But the people around Inez have made careers out of losing track. Her senator husband wants to forget the failure of his last bid for the presidency. Her husband's handler would like the press to forget that Inez's father is a murderer. And, in 1975, America is doing its best to lose track of its one-time client, the lethally hemorrhaging republic of South Vietnam.<br/><br/>As conceived by Joan Didion, these personages and events constitute the terminal fallout of democracy, a fallout that also includes fact-finding junkets, senatorial groupies, the international arms market, and the Orwellian newspeak of the political class.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/55/9780679754855.jpg', 'title_long': 'Democracy', 'edition': '1st Edition thus', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.15 Inches, Weight: 0.4739938633 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.15}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.61}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4739938633}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.98}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '1995-04-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Joan Didion'], 'title': 'Democracy', 'isbn13': '9780679754855', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307787370'}, 'isbn': '0679754857', 'isbn10': '0679754857', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307787378', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
