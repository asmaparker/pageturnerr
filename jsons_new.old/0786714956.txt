Following the tradition of Verne's original tales, Ian Watson tells of a journey deep into the center of the Earth, where Verne himself does battle with occultist Nazis, and Adam Roberts takes us to latter-day California, where a descendant of Verne's character Hector Servadac is preparing for the end of the world as we know it. These and many more compelling adventures add up to an anthology that will introduce a new generation to the wonder of Jules Verne and delight readers already familiar with the master.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/57/9780786714957.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Mammoth Book of New Jules Verne Adventures: Return to the Center of the Earth and Other Extraordinary Voyages, New Tales by the Heirs of Jules Verne', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.84 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.84}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 464, 'date_published': '2005-02-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Short Stories'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'The Mammoth Book of New Jules Verne Adventures: Return to the Center of the Earth and Other Extraordinary Voyages, New Tales by the Heirs of Jules Verne', 'isbn13': '9780786714957', 'msrp': 13.42, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0786714956', 'isbn10': '0786714956'}}
