Drawn into a netherworld of rituals and celebrations, Davis penetrated the vodoun mystique deeply enough to place zombification in its proper context within vodoun culture. In the course of his investigation, Davis came to realize that the story of vodoun is the history of Haiti—from the African origins of its people to the successful Haitian independence movement, down to the present day, where vodoun culture is, in effect, the government of Haiti’s countryside.<br/><br/>The Serpent and the Rainbow combines anthropological investigation with a remarkable personal adventure to illuminate and finally explain a phenomenon that has long fascinated Americans.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/95/9780684839295.jpg', 'title_long': "The Serpent and the Rainbow: A Harvard Scientist's Astonishing Journey into the Secret Societies of Haitian Voodoo, Zombis, and Magic", 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.60406659788 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.60406659788}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4375}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '1997-08-05', 'subjects': ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Occult & Paranormal', 'Magic Studies', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Botany', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'General', 'Sociology'], 'authors': ['Wade Davis'], 'title': "The Serpent and the Rainbow: A Harvard Scientist's Astonishing Journey into the Secret Societies of Haitian Voodoo, Zombis, and Magic", 'isbn13': '9780684839295', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1451628366'}, 'isbn': '0684839296', 'isbn10': '0684839296', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781451628364', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
