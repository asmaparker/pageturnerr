{'book': {'publisher': 'FisicalBook', 'synopsis': "Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/14/9781841932514.jpg', 'title_long': 'Paradise Lost', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.88 Inches, Length: 9.56 Inches, Weight: 1747.9 Grams, Width: 1.13 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.56}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.13}, 'weight': {'unit': 'grams', 'value': 1747.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.88}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Poetry', 'Themes & Styles'], 'authors': ['John Milton'], 'title': 'Paradise Lost', 'isbn13': '9781841932514', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1841932515', 'isbn10': '1841932515'}}
