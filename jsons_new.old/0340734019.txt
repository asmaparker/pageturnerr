But when the capture goes disastrously wrong, Lincoln and Amelia find themselves in a race to stop the Ghost before he can track down and murder the two surviving families who have vanished deep into the labyrinthine world of New York City's Chinese community. Over the next forty-eight hours the Ghost ruthlessly hunts for the families while Rhyme, aided by a policeman from mainland China, struggles to find them before they die and Sachs pursues a very different kind of policework - forming a connection with one of the immigrants that may have consequences going to the core of her relationship with her partner and lover, Lincoln Rhyme.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/18/9780340734018.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Stone Monkey', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.44881 Inches, Weight: 0.5952481074 Pounds, Width: 1.53543 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.44881}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.53543}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5952481074}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.00786}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Romance'], 'authors': ['Jeffery Deaver'], 'title': 'The Stone Monkey', 'isbn13': '9780340734018', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0340734019', 'isbn10': '0340734019'}}
