He can only "turn" one human in his lifetime, and most of his kind reserved that power for creating a life mate. He has to save Rachel Garrett. He doesn\'t know her very well, but the beautiful coroner had saved his life. To save hers he would make her immortal. Rachel Garrett awakes surprised. All she\'d wanted was to get off the night shift at the morgue; now here she is staggering to her feet naked and in a strange place. Then she sees the man of her dreams emerging from his...coffin? She just hopes he tastes as good as he looks.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/36/9780505525536.jpg', 'title_long': 'Love Bites (Argeneau Vampires, Book 2)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 1 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.43}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 373, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Vampires', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lynsay Sands'], 'title': 'Love Bites (Argeneau Vampires, Book 2)', 'isbn13': '9780505525536', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0505525534', 'isbn10': '0505525534'}}
