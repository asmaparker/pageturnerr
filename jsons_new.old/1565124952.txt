{'book': {'publisher': 'Algonquin Books', 'synopsis': "After ending a bad relationship, Casey Costello, an executive chef at a morning television show, swears off men. Who has the time anyway? She's busy overseeing a rambunctious food-prep crew in a kitchen the size of a closet; trying to please high-maintenance celebrity guest chefs; and dealing with her large extended Italian American family, who believe that the solutions to life's problems involve food. And in the midst of her high-energy, stress-inducing career―punctuated by a steady stream of parties and restaurant openings that must not be missed―she's trying to uncover why Sally Woods, a grand old dame of the culinary world and regular on the television show, is suddenly ready to jump ship and find a new station and a new executive chef.<br/><br/>When Danny O'Shea, a handsome chef from one of New York's hottest new restaurants, makes a guest appearance on the show, Casey smells trouble. But feelings ignite faster than a flambé dessert, especially when Danny whips up a few surprises during a television shoot in Italy.<br/><br/>Narrated in Casey's smart and refreshingly disarming voice, Last Bite is an irresistible culinary caper, with characters whose appetites are as big as their personalities.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/50/9781565124950.jpg', 'title_long': 'Last Bite: A Novel of Culinary Romance', 'edition': 'First Edition, 1st Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.76 Inches, Length: 5.62 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.21 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.62}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.21}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.76}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006-06-09', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Celebrities & TV Shows', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Nancy Verde Barr'], 'title': 'Last Bite: A Novel of Culinary Romance', 'isbn13': '9781565124950', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'Page Fidelity': '1616202831', 'eBook': '1616202831'}, 'isbn': '1565124952', 'isbn10': '1565124952', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781616202835', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
