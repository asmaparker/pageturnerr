The Boleyn Inheritance follows three women whose lives are forever changed because of the king’s decision, as they must balance precariously in an already shaky Tudor Court.<br/><br/>Anne of Cleves is to be married to Henry to form a political alliance, though the rocky relationship she has to the king does not bode well for her or for England.<br/><br/>Katherine Howard is the young, beautiful woman who captures Henry’s eye, even though he is set to marry Anne. Her spirit runs free and her passions run hot—though her affections may not be returned upon the King.<br/><br/>Jane Rochford was married to George Boleyn, and it was her testimony that sent her husband and infamous sister-in-law Anne to their deaths. Throughout the country, her name is known for malice, jealousy, and twisted lust.<br/><br/>The Boleyn Inheritance is a novel drawn tight as a lute string about three women whose positions brought them wealth, admirations, and power, as well as deceit, betrayal, and terror.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/06/9780743272506.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Boleyn Inheritance (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.2499815 Inches, Length: 6.2499875 Inches, Weight: 1.65 Pounds, Width: 1.499997 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.2499875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.499997}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.2499815}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '2006-12-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Philippa Gregory'], 'title': 'The Boleyn Inheritance (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels)', 'isbn13': '9780743272506', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0743272501', 'isbn10': '0743272501'}}
