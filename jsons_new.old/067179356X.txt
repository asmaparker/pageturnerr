{'book': {'publisher': 'Pocket Books', 'synopsis': "Inside a circle of trusted friends...one was a killer.<br/><br/>Jerry Harris was a self-made California millionaire who, at age forty-four, had it all: booming businesses, yachts, a mansion, a beautiful wife, and a voice to rival Elvis. No one who knew this well-liked, generous man could make sense of his sudden disappearance one autumn night. On a final phone call to his brother from his Mercedes, Jerry breathed a muffled oath -- then the line went dead. For Jerry's wife, Susan, it was just the beginning of an unwavering, eight-year search for the truth behind her husband's vanishing. Through exclusive access to an FBI agent inside the investigation, Ann Rule unmasks a man driven by malevolence and hidden jealousy to destroy Jerry Harris' magnificent business empire. She expertly profiles a criminal mind that stopped at nothing in a scheme of greed and violence. With the riveting power of a Greek tragedy, Rule reveals the dark underside of an all-American success story, and a wife's ultimate triumph of justice in the name of love. Including other unforgettable accounts of true crime, this is Ann Rule at her chilling best.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/62/9780671793562.jpg', 'title_long': "In the Name of Love: Ann Rule's Crime Files Volume 4 (4)", 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044933474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '1998-01-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Murder & Mayhem', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology'], 'authors': ['Ann Rule'], 'title': "In the Name of Love: Ann Rule's Crime Files Volume 4 (4)", 'isbn13': '9780671793562', 'msrp': 7.73, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '067179356X', 'isbn10': '067179356X'}}
