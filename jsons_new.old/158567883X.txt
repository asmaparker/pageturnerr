{'book': {'publisher': 'The Overlook Press', 'synopsis': "The Darkness That Comes Before, R. Scott Bakker's magnificent debut, drew thunderous acclaim from reviewers and fellow fantasy authors. Readers were invited into a darkly threatening, thrillingly imaginative universe as fully realized as that of any in modern fantasy and introduced to one of the genre's great characters: the powerful warrior-philosopher Anas√ªrimbor Kelhus, on whom the fate of a violently apocalyptic Holy War rests. Bakker's follow up to The Darkness That Comes Before, The Warrior Prophet enticed readers further into the richly imagined world of myth, violence, and sorcery. The startling and far-reaching answers to these questions are brought into thrilling focus in The Thousandfold Thought, the conclusion to The Prince of Nothing trilogy. Casting into question all the action that has taken place before, twisting readers' intuitions in unforeseen directions, remolding the fantasy genre to broaden the scope of intricacy and meaning, R. Scott Bakker has once again written a fantasy novel that defies all expectations and rewards the reader with an experience unlike any to be had in the canon of fantasy literature.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/39/9781585678839.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Thousandfold Thought (The Prince of Nothing, Book 3)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.999984 Inches, Length: 4.99999 Inches, Weight: 1.5 Pounds, Width: 0.999998 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.99999}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.999998}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.999984}}, 'pages': 560, 'date_published': '2007-01-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'Canadian', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Science Fiction', 'Short Stories'], 'authors': ['R.
