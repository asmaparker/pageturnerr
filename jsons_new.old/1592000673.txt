{'book': {'publisher': 'Cengage Learning PTR', 'synopsis': 'We�re entering a new era. Mini-DV filmmaking is the new folk, the new punk rock, the new medium where anyone can tell his story. $30 Film School is an alternative to spending four years and a hundred thousand dollars to learn the trade. It is influenced by punk rock�s Do-It-Yourself spirit of just learning the basics and then jumping up on a stage and making a point, and by the American work ethic back when it was pure, before it became all about corporations crushing the little guy. Throw in the hacker idea that information wants to be free (or at least very cheap) and you�ve got our deal. Inside you�ll find many interviews from insightful independent filmmakers and artists, as well as a host of practical advice, knowledge, and resources.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/78/9781592000678.jpg', 'title_long': '$30 Film School: How to write, direct, produce, shoot, edit, distribute, tour with, and sell your own no-budget DIGITAL movie', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.74014 Inches, Length: 7.24408 Inches, Weight: 1.90038469844 Pounds, Width: 0.98425 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.24408}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.98425}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.90038469844}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.74014}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '2003-05-13', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Graphic Design', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Direction & Production', 'Video'], 'authors': ['Michael W.
