Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018.<br/><br/>Coetzee grew up in a new development north of Cape Town, tormented by guilt and fear. With a father he despised, and a mother he both adored and resented, he led a double life—the brilliant and well-behaved student at school, the princely despot at home, always terrified of losing his mother\'s love. His first encounters with literature, the awakenings of sexual desire, and a growing awareness of apartheid left him with baffling questions; and only in his love of the high veld ("farms are places of freedom, of life") could he find a sense of belonging. Bold and telling, this masterly evocation of a young boy\'s life is the book Coetzee\'s many admirers have been waiting for, but never could have expected.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/68/9780140265668.jpg', 'title_long': 'Boyhood: Scenes from Provincial Life', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.1 Inches, Length: 0.5 Inches, Weight: 0.32 Pounds, Width: 0.43 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.43}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.32}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}}, 'pages': 166, 'date_published': '1998-09-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Historical', 'Africa', 'Memoirs', 'History', 'South Africa', 'Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'African', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['J.
