{'book': {'publisher': 'The New Press', 'synopsis': 'In this historic 1971 debate, two of the twentieth century’s most influential thinkers discuss whether there is such a thing as innate human nature.<br/><br/>In 1971, at the height of the Vietnam War and at a time of great political and social instability, two of the world’s leading intellectuals, Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault, were invited by Dutch philosopher Fons Elders to debate an age-old question: Is there such a thing as “innate” human nature independent of our experiences and external influences?<br/><br/>The resulting dialogue is one of the most original, provocative, and spontaneous exchanges to have occurred between contemporary philosophers. Above all, their discussion serves as a concise introduction to their two opposing theories. What begins as a philosophical argument rooted in linguistics (Chomsky) and the theory of knowledge (Foucault), soon evolves into a broader discussion encompassing a wide range of topics, from science, history, and behaviorism to creativity, freedom, and the struggle for justice in the realm of politics.<br/><br/>In addition to the debate itself, this volume features a newly written introduction by noted Foucault scholar John Rajchman and includes substantial additional texts by Chomsky and Foucault.<br/><br/>“[Chomsky is] arguably the most important intellectual alive.” ―The New York Times<br/><br/>“Foucault . . . leaves no reader untouched or unchanged.” ―Edward Said', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/41/9781595581341.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Chomsky-Foucault Debate: On Human Nature', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.26 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.26}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.56}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2006-09-18', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Applied Psychology', 'Reference', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Criticism', 'Logic & Language', 'Modern', 'Political', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science'], 'authors': ['Noam Chomsky', 'Michel Foucault'], 'title': 'The Chomsky-Foucault Debate: On Human Nature', 'isbn13': '9781595581341', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '1595586571'}, 'isbn': '1595581340', 'isbn10': '1595581340', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781595586575', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
