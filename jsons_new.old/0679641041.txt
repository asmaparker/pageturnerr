Seeming to preside over this nightmarish world is the diabolical Judge Holden, one of the most unforgettable characters in American fiction.<br/><br/>Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, Blood Meridian represents a genius vision of the historical West, one whose stature has only grown in the years since its publication.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/49/9780679641049.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West (Modern Library (Hardcover))', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.68 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.68}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.10010668738}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2001-01-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Westerns', 'Action & Adventure', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Cormac McCarthy'], 'title': 'Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West (Modern Library (Hardcover))', 'isbn13': '9780679641049', 'msrp': 23, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0679641041', 'isbn10': '0679641041'}}
