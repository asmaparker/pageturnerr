{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "The heartwarming and unforgettable story of a family and the wondrously neurotic dog who taught them what really matters in life. Now with photos and new material.<br/>Is it possible for humans to discover the key to happiness through a bigger-than-life, bad-boy dog? Just ask the Grogans.<br/>John and Jenny were just beginning their life together. They were young and in love, with not a care in the world. Then they brought home Marley, a wiggly yellow furball of a puppy. Life would never be the same.<br/>Marley grew into a barreling, ninety-seven-pound streamroller of a Labrador retriever. He crashed through screen doors, gouged through drywall, and stole women's undergarments. Obedience school did no good -- Marley was expelled.<br/>But just as Marley joyfully refused any limits on his behavior, his love and loyalty were boundless, too. Marley remained a model of devotion, even when his family was at its wit's end. Unconditional love, they would learn, comes in many forms.<br/>Marley & Me is John Grogan's funny, unforgettable tribute to this wonderful, wildly neurotic Lab and the meaning he brought to their lives.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/22/9780061238222.jpg', 'title_long': "Marley & Me Illustrated Edition: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog", 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.8 Pounds, Width: 1.06 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.06}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2006-10-31', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Dogs', 'Essays', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['John Grogan'], 'title': "Marley & Me Illustrated Edition: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog", 'isbn13': '9780061238222', 'msrp': 22.07, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061238228', 'isbn10': '0061238228'}}
