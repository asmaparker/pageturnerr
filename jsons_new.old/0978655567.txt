{'book': {'publisher': 'Firelight Press, Inc.', 'synopsis': 'Enter Alypium, a hidden world within our own where our old knowledge of magic is kept and strange and fantastical creatures abound. It is a beautiful and mystical place, but things are caving in. The king is hypnotized and his castle turned on its side. The very Substance that holds things together has gone awry, and whispers tell of evil plans to destroy everything. Twelve year old Erec Rex has been yanked out of the world as we know it and thrown unwillingly into this mess. As he learns how to get by in this strange world he also discovers some truths about himself ... and must learn the power of trust and love in order to save his mother, and all of Alypium. In this stunning tale packed with action, humor, a colorful cast of characters, and a riveting plot, debut author Kaza Kingsley brings us into a world of danger and excitement. For Erec, it is a world that is eerily familiar and inevitably intertwined with his future. To the reader, it is a fantastic escape that shall be taken again and again.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/63/9780978655563.jpg', 'title_long': "The Dragon's Eye (Erec Rex)", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 inches, Length: 6.25 inches, Weight: 1.41 Pounds, Width: 1.25 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 345, 'date_published': '2006-10-28', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic'], 'authors': ['Kaza Kingsley'], 'title': "The Dragon's Eye (Erec Rex)", 'isbn13': '9780978655563', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0978655567', 'isbn10': '0978655567'}}
