The survivors of that catastrophe now live on Earth, bereft of magic and hope, forbidden to return home.<br/><br/>Only Joram remains behind on the world ravaged by his Darksword. Although the magic weapon has been destroyed--and with it, Joram's power--rumors have risen that Joram has forged a second Darksword.<br/><br/>Now, as a merciless alien race threatens Earth with annihilation, Earth's desperate leaders look to Joram as their only hope. But even as his old friend Saryon begins the perilous journey to seek his aid, the embittered Joram has his own plans for the weapon.<br/><br/>And Joram is not the only one. Soon a new menace looms, foreshadowing betrayal, enslavement, and death to humans and Thimhallans alike.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/26/9780553578126.jpg', 'title_long': 'Legacy of the Darksword: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.76 Inches, Length: 4.18 Inches, Weight: 0.4739938633 Pounds, Width: 1.03 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.18}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.03}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4739938633}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.76}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '1998-06-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Action & Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Coming of Age', 'Romantic'], 'authors': ['Margaret Weis', 'Tracy Hickman'], 'title': 'Legacy of the Darksword: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780553578126', 'msrp': 8.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '055357812X', 'isbn10': '055357812X'}}
