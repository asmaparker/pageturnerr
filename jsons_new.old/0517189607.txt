{'book': {'publisher': "Children's Classics", 'synopsis': 'The Secret Garden, a classic loved for more than seventy-five years, is all that its title implies. It is, as one might imagine, a mystery. But it is also a love story and the love is as passionate and fervent as one could imagine. It is a story of the love of nature, of science and the scientific method, and of isolated and lonely human beings who learn to care not only for others, but equally important, for themselves. This deluxe Children’s Classic edition is produced with high-quality, leatherlike binding with gold stamping, full-color covers, colored endpapers with a book nameplate. Some of the other titles in this series include: Anne of Green Gables, Black Beauty, King Arthur and His Knights, Little Women, and Treasure Island.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/03/9780517189603.jpg', 'title_long': "The Secret Garden (Children's Classics)", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.52 Inches, Length: 5.61 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.83 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.61}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.83}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.89948602896}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.52}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1998-09-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Classics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Frances Hodgson Burnett'], 'title': "The Secret Garden (Children's Classics)", 'isbn13': '9780517189603', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0517189607', 'isbn10': '0517189607'}}
