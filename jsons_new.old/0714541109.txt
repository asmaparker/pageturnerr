{'book': {'publisher': 'Oneworld Classics', 'synopsis': 'This is the first volume of a collected edition of the complete plays of Luigi Pirandello, one of the major playwrights of the early 20th century. Henry IV (1922) has always been one of the most performed and popular of Pirandello’s works, both in Italy and in other countries. A study in the nature of reality and delusion, it has great dramatic impact and is intensely moving. The Man With the Flower (1923) is perhaps the best known of his shorter plays, poignant and devastating. Right You Are If You Think You Are (1917) is a major play that has had many successful productions and a strong message of live and let live. Lazarus (1929), although less known, remains one of Pirandello’s most haunting creations.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/05/9780714541105.jpg', 'title_long': 'Collected Plays Volume 1', 'edition': '1st US edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 230, 'date_published': '1987-07-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays'], 'authors': ['Luigi Pirandello'], 'title': 'Collected Plays Volume 1', 'isbn13': '9780714541105', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0714541109', 'isbn10': '0714541109'}}
