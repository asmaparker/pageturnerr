{'book': {'publisher': "Everyman's Library", 'synopsis': "From one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, the author of The Metamorphosis and The Trial—a collection of stories that represent the art of a modern master who had the gift of making our problematic spiritual life palpable and real.<br/><br/>Franz Kafka’s imagination so far outstripped the forms and conventions of the literary tradition he inherited that he was forced to turn that tradition inside out in order to tell his splendid, mysterious tales that are scrupulously naturalistic on the surface and uncanny in their depths.<br/><br/>This edition of his stories includes all his available shorter fiction in a collection edited, arranged, and introduced by Gabriel Josipovici in ways that bring out the writer’s extraordinary range and intensity of vision.<br/><br/>Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket. Contemporary Classics include an introduction, a select bibliography, and a chronology of the author's life and times.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/34/9780679423034.jpg', 'title_long': "Collected Stories (Everyman's Library)", 'edition': 'Revised Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.39 Inches, Length: 5.36 Inches, Weight: 1.27 Pounds, Width: 1.22 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.36}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.22}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.27}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.39}}, 'pages': 568, 'date_published': '1993-10-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'World Literature', 'European', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Franz Kafka'], 'title': "Collected Stories (Everyman's Library)", 'isbn13': '9780679423034', 'msrp': 16.49, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0375712690'}, 'isbn': '0679423036', 'isbn10': '0679423036', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780375712692', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
