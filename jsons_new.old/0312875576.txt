{'book': {'publisher': 'Tor Books', 'synopsis': 'Robert A. Heinlein, the dean of American SF writers, also wrote fantasy fiction throughout his long career, but especially in the early 1940s. The Golden Age of SF was also a time of revolution in fantasy fiction, and Heinlein was at the forefront. His fantasies were convincingly set in the real world, particularly those published in the famous magazine Unknown Worlds, including such stories as "Magic, Inc.," "\'They--,\'" and "The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag." Now all of Heinlein\'s best fantasy short stories, most of them long novellas, have been collected in one big volume for the first time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/72/9780312875572.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Fantasies of Robert A.
