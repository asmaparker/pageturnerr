{'book': {'publisher': 'Orion Pub Co', 'synopsis': "'Translation is always a shift,not between two languages but between two cultures. A translator must take into account rules that are not strictly linguistic but, broadly speaking, cultural.' Umberto Eco is of the world's most brilliant and entertaining writers on literature and language. In this accessible and dazzling study, he turns his eye on the subject of translations and the problems the differences between cultures can cause. The book is full of little gems about mistranslations and misunderstandings.For example when you put 'Studies in the logic of Charles Sanders Peirce' through an internet translation machine, it becomes 'Studies in the logic of the Charles of sandpaper grinding machines Peirce'. In Italian 'ratto' has no connotation of 'contemptible person' but denotes speed ('you dirty rat' could take on a whole new meaning!) What could be a weighty subject is never dull, fired by Eco's immense wit and erudition, providing an entertaining read that illuminates the process of negotation that all translators must make.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/88/9780753817988.jpg', 'title_long': 'Mouse or Rat : Translation As Negotiation', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.23621 Inches, Length: 7.874 Inches, Weight: 0.43651527876 Pounds, Width: 0.62992 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.874}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.62992}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.43651527876}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.23621}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'World Literature', 'European', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Umberto Eco'], 'title': 'Mouse or Rat : Translation As Negotiation', 'isbn13': '9780753817988', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1780226276', 'ePub': '1780226276'}, 'isbn': '0753817985', 'isbn10': '0753817985', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781780226279', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
