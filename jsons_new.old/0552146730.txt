Anyway, we do not live in a perfect world and it is foresighted and useful for a young woman to become proficient in those arts which will keep a weak-willed man from straying. Learning to cook is also useful.<br/><br/>Nanny Ogg, one of Discworld's most famous witches, here passes on some of her huge collection of tasty and interesting recipes. In addition to such dishes as Nobby's Mum's Distressed Pudding, Mrs. Ogg imparts her thoughts on such matters as life, death, and courtship, all in a refined style that should not offend the most delicate of sensibilities. Well, not much. Most of the recipes have been tried out on people who are still alive.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/39/9780552146739.jpg', 'title_long': "Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)", 'edition': 'Revised ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.40344593946 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.40344593946}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.9}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2001-11-01', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Cooking', 'Reference', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Terry Pratchett'], 'title': "Nanny Ogg's Cookbook: A Useful and Improving Almanack of Information Including Astonishing Recipes from Terry Pratchett's Discworld (Discworld Series)", 'isbn13': '9780552146739', 'msrp': 22.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0552146730', 'isbn10': '0552146730'}}
