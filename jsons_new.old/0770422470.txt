She was born and raised in the beautiful old-fashioned house on Prince Edward Island, "where things always seemed the same" and good things never changed. But things do change at Silver Bush--from her first day at school to the arrival of her new own first romance. Through it all, Pat shares her experiences with her beloved friends and discovers the one thing that truly never changes: the beauty and peace she will always find at Silver Bush--the house that remembers her whole life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/79/9780770422479.jpg', 'title_long': 'Pat of Silver Bush', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.85 Inches, Length: 4.15 Inches, Weight: 0.31305641204 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.15}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.31305641204}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.85}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1988-06-01', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['L.
