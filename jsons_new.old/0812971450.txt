He’s waiting for Dorothy, his fiancée, and tonight is the last night they’ll be meeting here, for it’s May 31st, and June 1st marks their wedding day. But she’s late, and Johnny soon learns of a horrible accident—an accident involving a group of drunken men, a low-flying charter plane, and an empty liquor bottle. In one short moment Johnny loses all that matters to him and his life is shattered. He vows to take from these men exactly what they took from him. After years of planning, Johnny begins his quest for revenge, and on May 31st of each year—always on May 31st—wives, lovers, and daughters are suddenly no longer safe.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/53/9780812971453.jpg', 'title_long': 'Rendezvous in Black (A Modern Library 20th Century Rediscovery)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.38 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.38}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2004-03-16', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Cornell Woolrich'], 'title': 'Rendezvous in Black (A Modern Library 20th Century Rediscovery)', 'isbn13': '9780812971453', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0812971450', 'isbn10': '0812971450'}}
