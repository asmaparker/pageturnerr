{'book': {'publisher': 'Hyperion', 'synopsis': 'One of our country\'s most acclaimed and beloved entertainers, Steve Martin has written a novella that is unexpectedly perceptive about relationships and life. Martin is profoundly wise when it comes to the inner workings of the human heart.<br/>Mirabelle is the "shopgirl" of the title, a young woman, beautiful in a wallflowerish kind of way, who works behind the glove counter at Neiman Marcus "selling things that nobody buys anymore..."<br/>Slightly lost, slightly off-kilter, very shy, Mirabelle charms because of all that she is not: not glamorous, not aggressive, not self-aggrandizing. Still there is something about her that is irresistible.<br/>Mirabelle captures the attention of Ray Porter, a wealthy businessman almost twice her age. As they tentatively embark on a relationship, they both struggle to decipher the language of love -- with consequences that are both comic and heartbreaking. Filled with the kind of witty, discerning observations that have brought Steve Martin critical success, Shopgirl is a work of disarming tenderness.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/78/9780786891078.jpg', 'title_long': 'Shopgirl: A Novella', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.5 Inches, Length: 4 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '2006-09-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Steve Martin'], 'title': 'Shopgirl: A Novella', 'isbn13': '9780786891078', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0786891076', 'isbn10': '0786891076'}}
