{'book': {'publisher': 'Bloomsbury Pub Ltd', 'synopsis': "He climbs a ladder to reach another man's wife and gives himself up to her beauty, but then Pilgermann descends into a mob of peasants inspired by the Pope to shed the blood of Jews. Alone on the cobblestones, mutilated and unmanned, he cries out to Israel, to the Lord his God, to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. He is answered instead by Jesus Christ: 'I'm the one you talk to from now on.' Every day is the Day of Reckoning and the judgement Christ brings is the start of straight action. Pilgermann hears a voice from within and becomes a pilgrim. Through time and war and Death itself, he makes his way along the road to Jerusalem, struggling to find God in the horror that surrounds him.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/04/9780747556404.jpg', 'title_long': 'Pilgermann', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.83463 Inches, Length: 5.9055 Inches, Weight: 0.3968320716 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.9055}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7874}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3968320716}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.83463}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2001-12-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Russell Hoban'], 'title': 'Pilgermann', 'isbn13': '9780747556404', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0747556407', 'isbn10': '0747556407'}}
