From his coming of age in America, to his formative war experiences, to his life as an artist, this is Vonnegut doing what he does best: Being himself. Whimsically illustrated by the author, A Man Without a Country is intimate, tender, and brimming with the scope of Kurt Vonnegut’s passions.<br/><br/>Praise for A Man Without a Country<br/><br/>“[This] may be as close as Vonnegut ever comes to a memoir.”–Los Angeles Times<br/><br/>“Like [that of] his literary ancestor Mark Twain, [Kurt Vonnegut’s] crankiness is good-humored and sharp-witted. . . . [Reading A Man Without a Country is] like sitting down on the couch for a long chat with an old friend.”–The New York Times Book Review<br/><br/>“Filled with [Vonnegut’s] usual contradictory mix of joy and sorrow, hope and despair, humor and gravity.”–Chicago Tribune<br/><br/>“Fans will linger on every word . . . as once again [Vonnegut] captures the complexity of the human condition with stunning calligraphic simplicity.”–The Australian<br/><br/>“Thank God, Kurt Vonnegut has broken his promise that he will never write another book. In this wondrous assemblage of mini-memoirs, we discover his family’s legacy and his obstinate, unfashionable humanism.”–Studs Terkel', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/63/9780812977363.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Man Without a Country', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.29 Pounds, Width: 0.42 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.42}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.29}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.98}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2007-01-16', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political', 'Reference & Collections', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Letters', 'United States', 'Anthologies', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Kurt Vonnegut'], 'title': 'A Man Without a Country', 'isbn13': '9780812977363', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0525510133'}, 'isbn': '081297736X', 'isbn10': '081297736X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780525510130', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
