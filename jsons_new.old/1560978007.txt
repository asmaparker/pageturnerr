{'book': {'publisher': 'Fantagraphics Books', 'synopsis': "From the creator of the 2005 hit graphic novel Black Hole comes this new softcover edition of his other masterpiece of modern horror. Big Baby is a particularly impressionable young boy named Tony Delmonte, who lives in a seemingly typical American suburb until he sneaks out of his room one night and becomes entangled in a horrific plot involving summer camp murders and backyard burials. Burns' clinical precision as an artist adds a sinister chill to his droll sense of humor, and his affection for 20th-century pulp fiction permeates throughout, creating a brilliant narrative that perfectly captures the unease and fear of adolescence.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/08/9781560978008.jpg', 'title_long': 'Big Baby', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.9 Inches, Length: 8.9 Inches, Weight: 1.11774366834 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.11774366834}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.9}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '2007-02-13', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Publishers', 'Fantagraphics'], 'authors': ['Charles Burns'], 'title': 'Big Baby', 'isbn13': '9781560978008', 'msrp': 15.27, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1560978007', 'isbn10': '1560978007'}}
