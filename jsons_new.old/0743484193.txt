When she becomes infatuated with fellow barrister Hale Allen, she isn't going to let a little thing like his being married get in the way. So, through the contacts of an ex-client, she hires professional killer Clara Rinker to get rid of his wife. Smart and attractive, Rinker is the best hitwoman in the business - but things go wrong; by an amazing coincidence there's a witness. It's the shooting of the witness, a cop, that brings Deputy Chief Lucas Davenport into the case.<br/><br/>Loan and Rinker must work together to clean up the loose ends - which includes getting Davenport off their backs by whatever means necessary.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/90/9780743484190.jpg', 'title_long': 'Certain Prey', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.01 Inches, Length: 4.37 Inches, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.37}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.01}}, 'pages': 438, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals'], 'authors': ['John Sandford'], 'title': 'Certain Prey', 'isbn13': '9780743484190', 'msrp': 14.45, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0743484193', 'isbn10': '0743484193'}}
