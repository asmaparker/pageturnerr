{'book': {'publisher': 'WildStorm', 'synopsis': 'Are we ready for yet another take on superhero morality?Let\'s hope so, because The Relentless retools old ideas for a new century. Warren Ellis has his heroes think globally as they kick butt locally, stopping or slowing down to consider how they can use their powers to "make the world a better place."How he can pull this off in our oh-so-ironic age is an artistic mystery, but the results are superheroes with believable personalities and community spirit. Two story arcs, each encompassing terror and evil on a global scale, pit the group of seven against armies of superhumans dispatched in scenes reminiscent of the best action movies. Many of the characters from the older Stormwatch series reappear here, and fans will be pleased to learn that Ellis has, if anything, improved his depth and storytelling prowess.Bryan Hitch\'s penciling, Paul Neary\'s inking, and Laura Depuy\'s coloring are all equally responsible for the gloriously lovely artwork--from interdimensional spaceships to dismembered spinal cords, they make saving the world beautiful. --Rob Lightner', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/66/9781563897566.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Authority Book 2: Under New Management', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.18 Inches, Length: 6.67 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.47 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.67}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.47}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.18}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2000-11-01', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Superheroes', 'Science & Math', 'Experiments, Instruments & Measurement', 'Experiments & Projects'], 'authors': ['Warren Ellis'], 'title': 'The Authority Book 2: Under New Management', 'isbn13': '9781563897566', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1563897563', 'isbn10': '1563897563'}}
