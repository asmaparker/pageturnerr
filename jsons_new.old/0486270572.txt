{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover', 'synopsis': 'Gogol\'s stories are admired for their skillful mingling of fantasy and reality, quiet good humor and use of mundane details — as Gogol put it — "to extract the extraordinary from the ordinary." Imaginative and timeless, they remain as fresh and significant today as they were to readers generations ago.<br/>This rich selection of four short stories by the great 19th-century Russian author of Dead Souls includes "The Nose," a savage satire of incompetent bureaucrats and the snobbery and complacency of the Russian upper classes; "Old-Fashioned Farmers," a sketch depicting an elderly couple who live a happy but simple life in rustic seclusion; "The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarrelled with Ivan Nikiforovich," and of Gogol\'s most famous comic stories; and "The Overcoat," an exceptionally moving tale — considered a masterpiece of the form — about a poor and much-ridiculed St. Petersburg official. Includes a selection from the Common Core State Standards Initiative: "The Nose."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/79/9780486270579.jpg', 'title_long': 'Overcoat and Other Short Stories', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.000625 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.000625}}, 'pages': 113, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Kindle Store', 'Categories', 'Kindle eBooks'], 'authors': ['Gogol Nikolai'], 'title': 'Overcoat and Other Short Stories', 'isbn13': '9780486270579', 'msrp': 3.47, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0486115178', 'ePub': '0486115178'}, 'isbn': '0486270572', 'isbn10': '0486270572', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486115177', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
