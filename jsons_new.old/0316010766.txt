{'book': {'publisher': 'Back Bay Books', 'synopsis': 'In the stories that make up Oblivion, David Foster Wallace joins the rawest, most naked humanity with the infinite involutions of self-consciousness -- a combination that is dazzlingly, uniquely his.<br/><br/>These are worlds undreamt of by any other mind. Only David Foster Wallace could convey a father\'s desperate loneliness by way of his son\'s daydreaming through a teacher\'s homicidal breakdown ("The Soul Is Not a Smithy"). Or could explore the deepest and most hilarious aspects of creativity by delineating the office politics surrounding a magazine profile of an artist who produces miniature sculptures in an anatomically inconceivable way ("The Suffering Channel"). Or capture the ache of love\'s breakdown in the painfully polite apologies of a man who believes his wife is hallucinating the sound of his snoring ("Oblivion").<br/><br/>Each of these stories is a complete world, as fully imagined as most entire novels, at once preposterously surreal and painfully immediate.<br/><br/>"Stunning...Wallace is an astonishing storyteller whose fiction reminds us why we learned to read in the first place." --San Francisco Chronicle', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/64/9780316010764.jpg', 'title_long': 'Oblivion: Stories', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-08-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['David Foster Wallace'], 'title': 'Oblivion: Stories', 'isbn13': '9780316010764', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0316010766', 'isbn10': '0316010766'}}
