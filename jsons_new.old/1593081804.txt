Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\x97biographical, historical, and literary\x97to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, \x93The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature.<br/>Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. \x93The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and \x93The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with \x93The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as \x93The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.<br/>Also included are \x93In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and \x93A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.<br/>Jason Baker is a writer of short stories living in Brooklyn, New York.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/05/9781593081805.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Metamorphosis and Other Stories (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.69 Inches, Length: 5.88 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.88}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.81}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.69}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2004-09-20', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories'], 'authors': ['Franz Kafka', 'Donna Freed'], 'title': 'The Metamorphosis and Other Stories (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)', 'isbn13': '9781593081805', 'msrp': 7.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1593081804', 'isbn10': '1593081804'}}
