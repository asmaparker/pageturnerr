{'book': {'publisher': 'City Lights Publishers', 'synopsis': 'Taboo and sacrifice, transgression and language, death and sensuality—Georges Bataille pursues these themes with an original, often startling perspective.<br/>Bataille challenges any single discourse on the erotic. The scope of his inquiry ranges from Emily Bronte to Sade,from St. Therese to Claude Levi-Strauss and Dr. Kinsey. The subjects he covers include prostitution, mythical ecstasy, cruelty, and organized war. Investigating desire prior to and extending beyond the realm of sexuality, he argues that eroticism is "a psychological quest not alien to death."<br/>" . . . one of the most original and unsettling of those thinkers who, in the wake of Sade and Nietzsche, have confronted the possibility of thought in a world that has lost its myth of transcendence."—Peter Brooks, New York Times Book Review<br/>"Bataille is one of the most important writers of the century."—Michel Foucault<br/>"[An] urgent, thrusting book about love, sex, death and spirituality by Georges Bataille."—Mark Price, Philosophy Now<br/>"A philosopher, essayist, novelist, pornographer and fervent Catholic who came to regard the brothels of Paris as his true \'churches\', Georges Bataille ranks among the boldest and most disturbing of twentieth-century thinkers. In this influential study he links the underlying sexual basis of religion to death, offering a dazzling array of insights into incest, prostitution, marriage, murder, sadism, sacrifice and violence, as well as including comments on Freud, Sade and Saint Theresa. Everywhere, Eroticism argues, sex is surrounded by taboos, which we must continually transgress in order to overcome the sense of isolation that faces us all."—The Book Depository<br/>Georges Bataille (1897-1962) was a French intellectual and literary icon who wrote essays, novels, and poems exploring philosophical and sociological subjects such as eroticism and surrealism. City Lights published more of Bataille\'s works including The Impossible, The Tears of Eros, and Story of the Eye.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/09/9780872861909.jpg', 'title_long': 'Erotism: Death and Sensuality', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.81 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.81}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 280, 'date_published': '1986-01-01', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Sexuality', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Modern', 'Social Sciences', 'Folklore & Mythology', 'Pornography', 'Human Sexuality'], 'authors': ['Georges Bataille'], 'title': 'Erotism: Death and Sensuality', 'isbn13': '9780872861909', 'msrp': 11.49, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0872861902', 'isbn10': '0872861902'}}
