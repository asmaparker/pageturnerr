{'book': {'publisher': 'Aegypan', 'synopsis': "Verne's 1865 tale of a trip to the moon is (as you'd expect from Verne) great fun, even if bits of it now seem, in retrospect, a little strange. Our rocket ship gets shot out of a cannon? To the moon? Goodness! But in other ways it's full of eerie bits of business that turned out to be very near reality: he had the cost, when you adjust for inflation, almost exactly right. There are other similarities, too. Verne's cannon was named the Columbiad; the Apollo 11 command module was named Columbia. Apollo 11 had a three-person crew, just as Verne's did; and both blasted off from the American state of Florida. Even the return to earth happened in more-or-less the same place. Coincidence -- or fact!? We say you'll have to read this story yourself to judge.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/49/9781598184549.jpg', 'title_long': 'From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, Fiction, Fantasy & Magic', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.4629707502 Pounds, Width: 0.32 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.32}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4629707502}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 136, 'date_published': '2006-10-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic'], 'authors': ['Jules Verne'], 'title': 'From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne, Fiction, Fantasy & Magic', 'isbn13': '9781598184549', 'msrp': 10.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1598184547', 'isbn10': '1598184547'}}
