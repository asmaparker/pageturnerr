{'book': {'publisher': 'VIZ Media LLC', 'synopsis': "Part-time student, full-time Soul Reaper, Ichigo is one of the chosen few guardians of the afterlife.<br/><br/>Ichigo Kurosaki never asked for the ability to see ghosts—he was born with the gift. When his family is attacked by a Hollow—a malevolent lost soul—Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper, dedicating his life to protecting the innocent and helping the tortured spirits themselves find peace. Find out why Tite Kubo’s Bleach has become an international manga smash-hit!<br/><br/>Ichigo Kurosaki has always been able to see ghosts, but this ability doesn't change his life nearly as much as his close encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper and member of the mysterious Soul Society. While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia--who is slowly regaining her powers--it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/18/9781591164418.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bleach, Vol. 1', 'edition': '10th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.38801358112 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.38801358112}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2004-07-06', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Action & Adventure', 'Media Tie-In', 'Shonen', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Tite Kubo'], 'title': 'Bleach, Vol. 1', 'isbn13': '9781591164418', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1591164419', 'isbn10': '1591164419'}}
