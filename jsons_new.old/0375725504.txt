Suddenly, he can't remember which stop is his, where he works, or even who he is. The only thing he can remember is his corporate motto: the maximum information in the minimum time.<br/><br/>Bill’s memory returns, but a strange numbness afflicts him. As he attempts to find a diagnosis for his deteriorating illness, he descends into a nightmarish tangle of inconclusive results, his company’s manic frenzy, and his family’s disbelief. Ultimately, Bill discovers that he is fighting not just for his body but also for his soul.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/00/9780375725500.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Diagnosis: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.9 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.9}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2002-02-19', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Alan Lightman'], 'title': 'The Diagnosis: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780375725500', 'msrp': 18, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0375725504', 'isbn10': '0375725504'}}
