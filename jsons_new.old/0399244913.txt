{'book': {'publisher': "G.P. Putnam's Sons Books for Young Readers", 'synopsis': 'Punctuation play is at its finest in this New York Times #1 bestseller!<br/><br/>Illuminating the comical confusion the lowly comma can cause, this new edition of Eats, Shoots & Leaves uses lively, subversive illustrations to show how misplacing or leaving out a comma can change the meaning of a sentence completely. You might want to eat a huge hot dog, but a huge, hot dog would run away pretty quickly if you tried to take a bite out of him. And a sign saying "Eat here and get gas" would hint at a very different odor than "Eat here, and get gas."<br/>This picture book is sure to elicit gales of laughter—and better punctuation—from all who read it.<br/>#1 New York Times Bestseller<br/>Book Sense Book of the Year Honor Book<br/>KidsReads.com Best Book of the Year', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/19/9780399244919.jpg', 'title_long': 'Eats, Shoots & Leaves: Why, Commas Really Do Make a Difference!', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.31 Inches, Length: 10.88 Inches, Weight: 0.69 Pounds, Width: 0.35 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.88}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.35}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.69}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.31}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '2006-07-25', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Education & Reference', 'Reading & Writing', 'Humor', 'General', 'Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Grammar', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lynne Truss'], 'title': 'Eats, Shoots & Leaves: Why, Commas Really Do Make a Difference!', 'isbn13': '9780399244919', 'msrp': 0.16, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0399244913', 'isbn10': '0399244913'}}
