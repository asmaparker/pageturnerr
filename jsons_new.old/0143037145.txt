{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Books', 'synopsis': "A #1 New York Times bestseller by Kim Edwards, The Memory Keeper’s Daughter is a brilliantly crafted novel of parallel lives, familial secrets, and the redemptive power of love<br/><br/>Kim Edwards’s stunning novel begins on a winter night in 1964 in Lexington, Kentucky, when a blizzard forces Dr. David Henry to deliver his own twins. His son, born first, is perfectly healthy, but the doctor immediately recognizes that his daughter has Down syndrome. Rationalizing it as a need to protect Norah, his wife, he makes a split second decision that will alter all of their lives forever. He asks his nurse, Caroline, to take the baby away to an institution and never to reveal the secret. Instead, she disappears into another city to raise the child herself. So begins this beautifully told story that unfolds over a quarter of a century—in which these two families, ignorant of each other, are yet bound by the fateful decision made that winter night long ago.<br/><br/>A family drama, The Memory Keeper’s Daughter explores every mother's silent fear: What would happen if you lost your child and she grew up without you? It is also an astonishing tale of love and how the mysterious ties that hold a family together help us survive the heartache that occurs when long-buried secrets are finally uncovered.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/71/49/9780143037149.jpg', 'title_long': "The Memory Keeper's Daughter: A Novel", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.67 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.67}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 401, 'date_published': '2006-05-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Psychological', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Mothers & Children', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Kim Edwards'], 'title': "The Memory Keeper's Daughter: A Novel", 'isbn13': '9780143037149', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1101010940'}, 'isbn': '0143037145', 'isbn10': '0143037145', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101010945', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
