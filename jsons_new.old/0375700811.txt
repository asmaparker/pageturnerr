{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize<br/><br/>In what is arguably his greatest book, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows<br/>the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's<br/>prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then<br/>killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on<br/>dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on<br/>keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<br/><br/>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his<br/>procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a<br/>restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The<br/>Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of<br/>American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/11/9780375700811.jpg', 'title_long': "The Executioner's Song", 'edition': '1st Vintage International ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.8 Pounds, Width: 2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 1072, 'date_published': '1998-04-28', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology'], 'authors': ['Norman Mailer'], 'title': "The Executioner's Song", 'isbn13': '9780375700811', 'msrp': 18, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0375700811', 'isbn10': '0375700811'}}
