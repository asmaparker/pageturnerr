{'book': {'publisher': 'Modern Library', 'synopsis': 'Eudora Welty was one of the twentieth century’s greatest literary figures. For as long as students have been studying her fiction as literature, writers have been looking to her to answer the profound questions of what makes a story good, a novel successful, a writer an artist. On Writing presents the answers in seven concise chapters discussing the subjects most important to the narrative craft, and which every fiction writer should know, such as place, voice, memory, and language. But even more important is what Welty calls “the mystery” of fiction writing—how the writer assembles language and ideas to create a work of art.<br/><br/>Originally part of her larger work The Eye of the Story but never before published in a stand-<br/>alone volume, On Writing is a handbook every fiction writer, whether novice or master, should keep within arm’s reach. Like The Elements of Style, On Writing is concise and fundamental, authoritative and timeless—as was Eudora Welty herself.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/01/9780679642701.jpg', 'title_long': 'On Writing (Modern Library)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2002-09-24', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Creativity', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Publishing & Books', 'Writing'], 'authors': ['Eudora Welty'], 'title': 'On Writing (Modern Library)', 'isbn13': '9780679642701', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0307786773'}, 'isbn': '0679642706', 'isbn10': '0679642706', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307786777', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
