{'book': {'publisher': 'Whitaker House', 'synopsis': 'Visions of Hell...<br/>In A Divine Revelation of Hell, over a period of thirty nights, God gave Mary K. Baxter visions of hell and commissioned her to tell people still alive on earth to reject sin and evil, and to choose life in Christ. Here is an account of the place and beings of hell contrasted with the glories of heaven. Follow Mary in her supernatural journey as she enters with Jesus into a gateway to hell and encounters the sights, sounds, and smells of that dark place of torment, including its evil spirits, cells, pits, jaws, and heart. Be an eyewitness to the various punishments of lost souls and hear their shocking stories. This book is a reminder that each of us needs to accept the miracle of salvation before it is too late—and to intercede for those who do not yet know Christ. Time is running out.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/91/9780883682791.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Divine Revelation Of Hell', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 0.49 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.49}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59965735264}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '1997-09-01', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Protestantism', 'Pentecostal & Charismatic', 'Theology', 'Angelology & Demonology', 'Eschatology', 'Mysticism', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Other Religions, Practices & Sacred Texts'], 'authors': ['Mary Baxter'], 'title': 'A Divine Revelation Of Hell', 'isbn13': '9780883682791', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0883682796', 'isbn10': '0883682796'}}
