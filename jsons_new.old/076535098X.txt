A thousand years have passed in service to his master, the dark god Satoris. The world view Satoris as Evil Prime and the name of Tanaros is the byword for treachery.<br/><br/>The races have united in their quest to rid the world of the Dark God and his minions. The key to the prophecy is the beautiful Elvish princess Cerelindeâ€•and Satoris has captured her.<br/><br/>Yet not all tales told are true and evil may have another face. Satoris refuses to act like the monster that he is made out to be for he recognizes in Cerelinde a spark of the love that he once bore for his fellow gods. But this spark of light might prove to be a danger to Satoris...and a greater danger for Tanaros and all that he holds dear. For Cerelinde might remind him that the heart that he willed to iron an eon ago is still very much mortal.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/85/9780765350985.jpg', 'title_long': 'Godslayer (Volume Two of The Sundering)', 'edition': 'paperback / softback', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.000625 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.000625}}, 'pages': 404, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic'], 'authors': ['Carey Jacqueline'], 'title': 'Godslayer (Volume Two of The Sundering)', 'isbn13': '9780765350985', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '076535098X', 'isbn10': '076535098X'}}
