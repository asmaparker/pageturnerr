Thinking of the egg she is about to lay she manages to extract herself and fly to the nearest port.<br/>Exhausted, she lands on a balcony where Zorba the cat is sunning himself. Zorba wants to get help, but the gull knows it's too late and she extracts three promises from him: 1) That he won't eat the egg, 2) that he'll take care of the chick until it hatches, and 3) that he'll teach it to fly.<br/>The first two are hard enough, but the third one is surely impossible.
