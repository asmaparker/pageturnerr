{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': 'Summoned to the country estate of his wealthy uncle Colonel Yegor Rostanev, the young student Sergey Aleksandrovich finds himself thrown into a startling bedlam. For as he soon sees, his meek and kind-hearted uncle is wholly dominated by a pretentious and despotic pseudo-intellectual named Opiskin, a charlatan who has ingratiated himself with Yegor’s mother and now holds the entire household under his thumb. Watching the absurd theatrics of this domestic tyrant over forty-eight explosive hours, Sergey grows increasingly furious - until at last, he feels compelled to act. A compelling comic exploration of petty tyranny, The Village of Stepanchikovo reveals a delight in life’s wild absurdities that rivals even Gogol’s. It also offers a fascinating insight into the genesis of the characters and situations of many of Dostoyevsky’s great later novels, including The Idiot, Devils and The Brothers Karamazov.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/86/9780140446586.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Village of Stepanchikovo: And its Inhabitants: From the Notes of an Unknown (Penguin Classics)', 'edition': 'Subsequent', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.58 Inches, Length: 7.8 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 5.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.440924524}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.58}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1995-12-01', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Regional & Cultural', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Fyodor Dostoyevsky'], 'title': 'The Village of Stepanchikovo: And its Inhabitants: From the Notes of an Unknown (Penguin Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780140446586', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0140446583', 'isbn10': '0140446583'}}
