{'book': {'publisher': 'University of California Press', 'synopsis': "Exiled in Paris provides a compelling look at the personalities who fueled the literary and philosophical dramas of postwar Paris: James Baldwin, Alexander Trocchi, Boris Vian, Maurice Girodias, and many others. James Campbell provides a fresh look at Samuel Beckett's early career; reveals the facts behind the publication of the scandalous best-seller The Story of O; and tells the poignant story of Richard Wright's years in exile. He captures the sense of deliverance that Wright, so accustomed to daily humiliations in his own country, experienced during his sojourn on the Left Bank, where, for the first time in his life, he was treated as a great man of letters. Here, too, are all the circumstances surrounding Wright's mysterious death, which many close to him regarded as suspicious.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/13/9780520234413.jpg', 'title_long': 'Exiled in Paris: Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Samuel Beckett, and Others on the Left Bank', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 300, 'date_published': '2003-02-03', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Europe', 'Latin America', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Science & Math', 'Earth Sciences', 'Geography', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Gender Studies', 'Ethnic Studies', 'LGBTQ+ Demographic Studies'], 'authors': ['James Campbell'], 'title': 'Exiled in Paris: Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Samuel Beckett, and Others on the Left Bank', 'isbn13': '9780520234413', 'msrp': 29.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0520234413', 'isbn10': '0520234413'}}
