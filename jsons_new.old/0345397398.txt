Lestat, c\'est moi. I want you to love all of my characters. I am, in the writing of these and other novels, as ambitious as Dickens. I want everybody to cry when Claudia dies, just like they did for Little Nell."<br/><br/>-- Anne Rice<br/><br/>February 8, 1995<br/><br/>Interview with the Vampire. The Vampire Lestat.
