{'book': {'publisher': 'Univ Of Minnesota Press', 'synopsis': "Originally published in 1976, Christopher and His Kind covers the most memorable ten years in the writer's life - from 1929, when Isherwood left England to spend a week in Berlin and decided to stay there indefinitely, to 1939, when he arrived in America.<br/>What most impressed the first readers of this memoir was the candor with which he describes his life in gay Berlin of the 1930s and his struggles to save his companion, Heinz, from the Nazis. An engrossing and dramatic story and a fascinating glimpse into a little-known world, Christopher and His Kind remains one of Isherwood's greatest achievements.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/35/9780816638635.jpg', 'title_long': 'Christopher And His Kind', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2001-09-18', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'LGBTQ+ Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction'], 'authors': ['Christopher Isherwood'], 'title': 'Christopher And His Kind', 'isbn13': '9780816638635', 'msrp': 18.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0816638632', 'isbn10': '0816638632'}}
