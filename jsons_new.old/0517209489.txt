But while it appears to be a paradise, nothing is what it seems.<br/><br/>They soon discover the terrifying truth: On this world humans are savage beasts, and apes rule as their civilized masters. In an ironic novel of nonstop action and breathless intrigue, one man struggles to unlock the secret of a terrifying civilization, all the while wondering: Will he become the savior of the human race, or the final witness to its damnation? In a shocking climax that rivals that of the original movie, Boulle delivers the answer in a masterpiece of adventure, satire, and suspense.<br/><br/>From the Paperback edition.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/86/9780517209486.jpg', 'title_long': 'Planet of the Apes (Cinema Classics (Gramercy Books (Firm)).)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.89948602896 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.89948602896}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 191, 'date_published': '2000-06-06', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations'], 'authors': ['Pierre Boulle'], 'title': 'Planet of the Apes (Cinema Classics (Gramercy Books (Firm)).)', 'isbn13': '9780517209486', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0517209489', 'isbn10': '0517209489'}}
