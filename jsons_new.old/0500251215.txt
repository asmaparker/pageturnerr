{'book': {'publisher': 'Thames & Hudson', 'synopsis': 'A full, authoritative, and wholly engaging account of these endlessly fascinating tales and of the ancient society in which they were created. Greek myths are among the most complex and influential stories ever told. From the first millennium BC until today, the myths have been repeated in an inexhaustible series of variations and reinterpretations. They can be found in the latest movies and television shows and in software for interactive computer games. This book combines a retelling of Greek myths with a comprehensive account of the world in which they developed―their themes, their relevance to Greek religion and society, and their relationship to the landscape. "Contexts, Sources, Meanings" describes the main literary and artistic sources for Greek myths, and their contexts, such as ritual and theater. "Myths of Origin" includes stories about the beginning of the cosmos, the origins of the gods, the first humans, and the founding of communities. "The Olympians: Power, Honor, Sexuality" examines the activities of all the main divinities. "Heroic exploits" concentrates on the adventures of Perseus, Jason, Herakles, and other heroes. "Family sagas" explores the dramas and catastrophes that befall heroes and heroines. "A Landscape of Myths" sets the stories within the context of the mountains, caves, seas, and rivers of Greece, Crete, Troy, and the Underworld. "Greek Myths after the Greeks" describes the rich tradition of retelling, from the Romans, through the Renaissance, to the twenty-first century.<br/>Complemented by lavish illustrations, genealogical tables, box features, and specially commissioned drawings, this will be an essential book for anyone interested in these classic tales and in the world of the ancient Greeks. 250 illustrations, 120 in color', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/18/9780500251218.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Complete World of Greek Mythology', 'edition': '1st Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.4 Inches, Length: 7.9 Inches, Weight: 2.645547144 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.645547144}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.4}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2004-06-28', 'subjects': ['History', 'Ancient Civilizations', 'Greece', 'World', 'Religious', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Mythology & Folk Tales', 'Mythology', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Folklore & Mythology', 'Archaeology'], 'authors': ['Richard Buxton'], 'title': 'The Complete World of Greek Mythology', 'isbn13': '9780500251218', 'msrp': 39.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0500251215', 'isbn10': '0500251215', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780500776407', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
