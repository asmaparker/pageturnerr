{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': "Now in Penguin Classics Deluxe: a treasure trove of Jane Austen's novels<br/>Few novelists have conveyed the subtleties and nuances of their own social milieu with the wit and insight of Jane Austen. Here in one volume are her seven great novels: Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, and Lady Susan. Through her vivacious and spirited heroines and their circle, Austen vividly portrays English middle-class life as the eighteenth century came to a close and the nineteenth century began. Each of the novels is a love story and a story about marriage—marriage for love, for financial security, for social status. But they are not romances; ironic, comic, and wise, they are masterly evocations of the society Jane Austen observed. This beautiful volume covers the literary career of one of England’s finest prose stylists of any century.<br/><br/>•<br/>A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition with French flaps and luxurious packaging<br/>•<br/>Features the definitive Penguin Classics texts recommended by the Jane Austen Society<br/>•<br/>New introduction by bestselling author of The Jane Austen Book Club Karen Joy Fowler<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
