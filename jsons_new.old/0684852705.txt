{'book': {'publisher': 'Scribner', 'synopsis': 'The true story of a boy whose life was saved by literature, Hamlet\'s Dresser is a portrait of a person made whole by art. Bob Smith\'s childhood was a fragile and lonely one, spent largely caring for his handicapped sister, Carolyn. But at age ten, his local librarian gave him a copy of Shakespeare\'s The Merchant of Venice, and it transformed him. In Bob\'s first look at Shakespeare\'s penetrating language -- "In sooth I know not why I am so sad" -- he had found a window through which to view the world. Years later, when the American Shakespeare Festival moved into Stratford and Smith was hired as Hamlet\'s dresser, his life\'s passion took shape.<br/>Blending tragedy and comedy, Smith gracefully weaves together his childhood memories with his experiences backstage and teaching the plays. The result is a gorgeous, tender, infectious book about the restorative powers of literature and art.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/06/9780684852706.jpg', 'title_long': "Hamlet's Dresser: A Memoir", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.58}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2003-02-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Educators', 'Regional U.S.', 'New England', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Bob Smith'], 'title': "Hamlet's Dresser: A Memoir", 'isbn13': '9780684852706', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0684852705', 'isbn10': '0684852705'}}
