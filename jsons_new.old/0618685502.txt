{'book': {'publisher': 'Southern Poverty Law Center', 'synopsis': "Where do dreams come from? What stealthy nighttime messengers are the guardians of our most deeply hidden hopes and our half-forgotten fears? Drawing on her rich imagination, two-time Newbery winner Lois Lowry confronts these questions and explores the conflicts between the gentle bits and pieces of the past that come to life in dream, and the darker horrors that find their form in nightmare. In a haunting story that tiptoes between reality and imagination, two people—a lonely, sensitive woman and a damaged, angry boy—face their own histories and discover what they can be to one another, renewed by the strength that comes from a tiny, caring creature they will never see.<br/><br/>Gossamer is perfect for readers not quite ready for Lois Lowry's Newbery-Award winner The Giver and also for readers interested in dreams, nightmares, spirits and the dream world.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/09/9780618685509.jpg', 'title_long': 'Rhinos & Raspberries: Tolerance Tales For The Early Grades', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.45 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.45}}, 'pages': 80, 'date_published': '2006-06', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic'], 'authors': ['Lois Lowry'], 'title': 'Rhinos & Raspberries: Tolerance Tales For The Early Grades', 'isbn13': '9780618685509', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0547345003'}, 'isbn': '0618685502', 'isbn10': '0618685502', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547345000', 'binding': 'saleableprint'}]}}
