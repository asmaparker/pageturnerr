A talented architect, she's just beginning to savor the fruits of her success when she meets a man who will change everything.<br/><br/>Mayor-Elect Taylor MacKensie is handsome, charming, and charismatic. Still, Ria never imagines that she'll leave a Christmas party with him, or that, caught up in the magic of a snowfall and a bottle of champagne, she'll give in to desire. Eight weeks later, Ria knows she's carrying Taylor's child.<br/><br/>To give their baby a name, Ria persuades Taylor to marry her—at least temporarily. But while Ria soon feels a surprising tenderness—and passion—for Taylor, she fears his prime concern is protecting his career. Ria vows to keep her distance from the man who holds the key to her heart...until life teaches them both a lesson in miracles—and love.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/09/9780553576009.jpg', 'title_long': 'Tidings of Great Joy: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.33730686 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.33730686}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '1999-11-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Holidays'], 'authors': ['Sandra Brown'], 'title': 'Tidings of Great Joy: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780553576009', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0553576003', 'isbn10': '0553576003'}}
