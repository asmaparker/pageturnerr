{'book': {'publisher': 'VIZ Media LLC', 'synopsis': 'Part man, but mostly machine, Batou is the toughest son of a bitch employed by a mysterious agency known as Section 9. When terrorists come to town, Batou straps on a battery of high-tech weaponry and goes to work.<br/><br/>But even a hulking cyborg like Batou has a sensitive side. After all these years, he still mourns the loss of his partner, Maj. Motoko Kusanagi. And now his beloved basset hound Gabriel has mysteriously disappeared. To complicate matters even further, he’s having reoccurring dreams about a son he never had. Combating violent insurgents is one thing; getting in touch with your feelings is totally different. Suddenly, Batou must grapple with the thing he understands the least: his own humanity!<br/><br/>Expanding on the concepts explored in the movie, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, Masaki Yamada’s novel also stands as a wholly original piece of work not tethered directly to any Ghost in the Shell continuity. Say hello to After The Long Goodbye—highly recommended for readers looking for science fiction with a soul.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/42/9781421513942.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence: After the Long Goodbye', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 200, 'date_published': '2007-07-17', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Science Fiction', 'Media Tie-In', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Masaki Yamada'], 'title': 'Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence: After the Long Goodbye', 'isbn13': '9781421513942', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1421513943', 'isbn10': '1421513943'}}
