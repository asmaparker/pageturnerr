{'book': {'publisher': 'Thomas Nelson Inc', 'synopsis': 'In Searching for God Knows What, Donald Miller\'s provocative and funny book, he shows readers that the greatest desire of every person is the desire for redemption. Every person is constantly seeking redemption (or at least the feeling of it) in his or her life, believing countless gospels that promise to fix the brokenness. Typically their pursuits include the desire for fulfilling relationships, successful careers, satisfying religious systems, status, and escape. Miller reveals how the inability to find redemption leads to chaotic relationships, self-hatred, the accumulation of meaningless material possessions, and a lack of inner peace. Readers will learn to identify in themselves and within others the universal desire for redemption. They will discover that the gospel of Jesus is the only way to find meaning in life and true redemption. Mature believers as well as seekers and new Christians will find themselves identifying with the narrative journey unfolded in the book, which is simply the pursuit of redemption.<br/>"Miller . . . writes on faith with candor and passion reminiscent of Frederick Buechner and Anne Lamott." -The Oregonian<br/>"Like a shaken snow globe, Donald Miller\'s newest collection of essays creates a swirl of ideas about the Christian life that eventually crystallize into a lovely landscape . . . [He] is one of the evangelical book market\'s most creative writers." -Christianity Today<br/>"For fans of Blue Like Jazz, I doubt you will be disappointed. Donald Miller writes with the wit and vulnerability that you expect. Sharing stories of his upbringing and his journey in more recent years, he perfectly illustrates important themes in a genuine and humorous manner .. . For those who would be reading Miller for the first time, this would be a great start. -Relevant<br/>"Whenever people ask me about Donald Miller, I notice the first thing I say is, \'That guy can write.\' Having met Don, I also know he seeks to live what he writes, or better said, he writes what he lives. That, I think, is the top credential for a person who writes about ultimate concerns-spirituality, meaning, purpose, life, God, and joy. In Searching for God Knows What, you\'ll find more of his great writing, honest feeling, and spiritual insight to help you on your journey. -Brian McLaren Pastor, Author-www.anewkindofchristian.com', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/15/9780785263715.jpg', 'title_long': 'Searching for God Knows What', 'edition': 'Later Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 246, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Spiritual Growth', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'Memoirs', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Donald Miller'], 'title': 'Searching for God Knows What', 'isbn13': '9780785263715', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1418529958'}, 'isbn': '0785263713', 'isbn10': '0785263713', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781418529956', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
