{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': 'Where there is light, there must always be shadow… The fifth volume in Janny Wurts’s spectacular epic fantasy, now re-released with a striking new cover design along with the rest of the series.<br/>The wars began when two half-brothers, gifted of light and shadow, stood shoulder to shoulder to defeat the Mistwraith. Their foe cast a lifelong curse of enmity between them that has so far woven three bitter conflicts and uncounted deadly intrigues.<br/>It is a time of political upheavel, fanaticism and rampaging armies. Distrust of sorcery has set off a purge of the talented mageborn – none reviled more than Arithon, Master of Shadow. Through clever manipulation of events at the hands of his half-brother Lysaer, Lord of Light, Arithon’s very name has become anathema. Now the volatile hatreds that spearheaded the campaign against Shadow have overtaken all reason.<br/>Those that still stand in Arithon’s desperate defence are downtrodden, in retreat and close to annihilation. The stage is set for the ultimate betrayal.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/28/9780007102228.jpg', 'title_long': 'Alliance of light, book two: Grand conspiracy', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.5 Inches, Weight: 0.771617917 Pounds, Width: 1.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.771617917}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 656, 'date_published': '2000', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'War', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Traditional Detectives', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Military'], 'authors': ['Janny WURTS'], 'title': 'Alliance of light, book two: Grand conspiracy', 'isbn13': '9780007102228', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0007102224', 'isbn10': '0007102224'}}
