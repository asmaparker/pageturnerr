{'book': {'publisher': 'Univ Of Minnesota Press', 'synopsis': 'This book is not only a major twentieth-century contribution to Dostoevsky’s studies, but also one of the most important theories of the novel produced in our century. As a modern reinterpretation of poetics, it bears comparison with Aristotle.“Bakhtin’s statement on the dialogical nature of artistic creation, and his differentiation of this from a history of monological commentary, is profoundly original and illuminating. This is a classic work on Dostoevsky and a statement of importance to critical theory.” Edward Wasiolek“Concentrating on the particular features of ‘Dostoevskian discourse,’ how Dostoevsky structures a hero and a plot, and what it means to write dialogically, Bakhtin concludes with a major theoretical statement on dialogue as a category of language. One of the most important theories of the novel in this century.” The Bloomsbury Review', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/84/9780816612284.jpg', 'title_long': 'Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics (Volume 8) (Theory and History of Literature)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.17 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.17}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '1984-06-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy'], 'authors': ['Mikhail Bakhtin'], 'title': 'Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics (Volume 8) (Theory and History of Literature)', 'isbn13': '9780816612284', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0816612285', 'isbn10': '0816612285'}}
