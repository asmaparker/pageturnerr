In clear, practical terms, this primer explains how early childhood educators of young children up to the age of nine can support the efforts of non-English-speaking children in nursery schools, infant schools, day care centers and classrooms to use - and learn - English as a second language. Loaded with original ideas and down-to-earth, practical advice, this book - widely revised and considerably expanded in this, its second edition - is an essential guide to developing a sensitive, caring and welcoming program for all the world's children.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/27/9780887511127.jpg', 'title_long': "Teaching the World's Children: ESL For Ages Three to Seven (Pippin Teacher's Library)", 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.98 Inches, Length: 6.02 Inches, Weight: 0.3968320716 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.02}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3968320716}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.98}}, 'pages': 102, 'date_published': '2004-05-13', 'subjects': ['Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Reading Skills', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Instruction Methods'], 'authors': ['Mary Ashworth', 'H.
