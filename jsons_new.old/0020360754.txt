{'book': {'publisher': 'Scribner', 'synopsis': 'Before she wrote the bestselling Brokeback Mountain, Annie Proulx was already producing some of the finest short fiction in the country. Here are her collected stories, including two new works never before anthologized.<br/><br/>These stories reverberate with rural tradition, the rites of nature, and the rituals of small town life. The country is blue collar New England; the characters are native families and the dispossessed working class, whose heritage is challenged by the neorural bourgeoisie from the city; and the themes are as elemental as the landscape: revenge, malice, greed, passion. Told with skill and profundity and crafted by a master storyteller, these are lean, tough tales of an extraordinary place and its people.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/59/9780020360759.jpg', 'title_long': 'Heart Songs and Other Stories', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.4850169764 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.52}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4850169764}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1995-03-17', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Annie Proulx'], 'title': 'Heart Songs and Other Stories', 'isbn13': '9780020360759', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1416588906'}, 'isbn': '0020360754', 'isbn10': '0020360754', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416588900', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
