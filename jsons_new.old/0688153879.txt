{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Do you think you have a "bad memory"?<br/>Impossible, says Kevin Trudeau, the world\'s foremost authority on memory improvement training. There are no bad memories, only untrained memories. In order to release our natural memory, Trudeau says, we just need to learn to retrieve what we already know. As founder of the American Memory Institute, Kevin Trudeau has already helped more than one million people do just that.<br/>Each Mega Memory lesson in this book takes no more than thirty minutes per day and uses pictures, rather than the laborious word-association techniques of other memory systems, to activate our inborn memory. With this easy-to-follow system, you\'ll be able to instantly remember names, phone numbers, addresses, financial data, speeches, and schoolwork. Even better, Trudeau\'s system ensures instant recall and long-term Mega Memory. All you need is the desire to unleash your Mega Memory, and you can reap all these incredible rewards!<br/>Labeled with a learning disability at an early age, Kevin Trudeau was convinced his problem was an inability to recall information. He read everything he could on memory improvement. Eventually, he developed his own program for memory retrieval and formed the American Memory Institute. His Mega Memory home study system is the most utilized self-improvement series of all time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/78/9780688153878.jpg', 'title_long': "Kevin Trudeau's Mega Memory: How to Release Your Superpower Memory in 30 Minutes Or Less a Day", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.88625829324 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.88625829324}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2005-08-16', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Memory Improvement', 'Success', 'Time Management', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cognitive Psychology'], 'authors': ['Kevin Trudeau'], 'title': "Kevin Trudeau's Mega Memory: How to Release Your Superpower Memory in 30 Minutes Or Less a Day", 'isbn13': '9780688153878', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0688153879', 'isbn10': '0688153879'}}
