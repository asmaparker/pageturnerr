Betrayed by those she most trusted, she would be lured into a deadly game of power, only to lose to her envious and unforgiving cousin, Elizabeth I. Here is her story, a queen who lost a throne for love, a monarch pampered and adored even as she was led to her beheading, the unforgettable woman who became a legend for all time.<br/><br/>Praise for Mary Queen of Scots<br/><br/>“She was sometimes reviled as a scheming whore, sometimes revered as a misunderstood martyr.
