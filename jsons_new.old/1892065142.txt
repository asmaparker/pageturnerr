This edition is out of print but a new paperback edition, with identical text except for the Afterword, is available as of April 2012.<br/><br/>Noren knew that his world was not as it should be--it was wrong that only the Scholars, and their representatives the Technicians, could use metal tools and Machines. It was wrong that only they had access to the mysterious City, which he had always longed to enter. Above all, it was wrong for the Scholars to have sole power over the distribution of knowledge. The High Law imposed these restrictions and many others, though the Prophecy promised that someday knowledge and Machines would be available to everyone. Noren was a heretic. He defied the High Law and had no faith in the Prophecy's fulfillment. But the more he learned of the grim truth about his people's deprivations, the less possible it seemed that their world could ever be changed. It would take more drastic steps than anyone imagined to restore their rightful heritage.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/48/9781892065148.jpg', 'title_long': 'Children Of The Star', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.84967837818 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.84967837818}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 728, 'date_published': '2000-01-24', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['Sylvia Engdahl'], 'title': 'Children Of The Star', 'isbn13': '9781892065148', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1892065142', 'isbn10': '1892065142'}}
