{'book': {'publisher': 'Granta Books', 'synopsis': "David Rodinsky lived above a synagogue in the heart of the old Jewish East End of London, and sometime in the late 1960s he disappeared. His room, a chaos of writings, annotated books and maps, gramophone records and clothes, was left undisturbed for 20 years. Rodinsky's world captured the imagination of a young artist, Rachel Lichtenstein, whose grandparents had escaped Poland in the 30s, and over a period of years she began to document the bizarre collection of artifacts that were found in his room, and make installations using images from his enigmatic bequest. She became obsessed with this mysterious man: Who was he? Where did he come from? Where did he go? Now Lichtenstein and Iain Sinclair have written an extraordinary book that weaves together Lichenstein's quest for Rodinsky. Part mystery story, part memoir, part travelogue, Rodinsky's Room is a testament to a world that has all but vanished and the celebration of the life of a unique man.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/96/9781862073296.jpg', 'title_long': "Rodinsky's Room", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.661386786 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.661386786}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 362, 'date_published': '2000', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'History', 'Great Britain', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors': ['Rachel Lichtenstein', 'Iain Sinclair'], 'title': "Rodinsky's Room", 'isbn13': '9781862073296', 'msrp': 14.25, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1862073295', 'isbn10': '1862073295'}}
