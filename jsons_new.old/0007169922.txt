{'book': {'publisher': 'Harpercollins Childs', 'synopsis': '"A plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street grows into a story that no one can beat!" In this delightful tale, Young Marco allows his imagination to run riot as he travels home from school one day, to the extent that a horse and cart is soon transformed into a chaotic carnival of colourful creatures. This delightful book forms part of the second stage in HarperCollins\' major Dr. Seuss rebrand programme. With the relaunch of 10 more titles in August 2003, such all-time favourites as How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You? and Dr. Seuss\' Sleep Book boast bright new covers that incorporate much needed guidance on reading levels: Blue Back Books are for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books are for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books are for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street belongs to the Green Back Book range.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/24/9780007169924.jpg', 'title_long': 'And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street Green Back Book', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.85825 Inches, Length: 6.41731 Inches, Weight: 0.1984160358 Pounds, Width: 0.15748 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.41731}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.15748}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.1984160358}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.85825}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Dr Seuss'], 'title': 'And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street Green Back Book', 'isbn13': '9780007169924', 'msrp': 10.35, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0007169922', 'isbn10': '0007169922'}}
