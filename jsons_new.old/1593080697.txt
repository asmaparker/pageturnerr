The first major fictional work published by Tolstoy after a mid-life psychological crisis, this novella reflects the author’s struggle to find meaning in life, a challenge Tolstoy resolved by developing a religious philosophy based on brotherly love, mutual support, and charity. These guiding principles are the dominant moral themes in &&LI&&RThe Death of Ivan Ilych&&L/I&&R, an account of the spiritual conversion of a judge―an ordinary, unthinking, vulgar man―in the face of his terrible fear about death. &&L/P&&R&&LP&&RAlso included in this volume are &&LI&&RFamily Happiness&&L/I&&R, an early work that traces the arc of a marriage; &&LI&&RThe Kreutzer Sonata&&L/I&&R, a frank tale of sexual love that shocked readers when it first appeared; and &&LI&&RHadji Murád&&L/I&&R, Tolstoy’s final masterpiece about power politics, intrigue, and colonial conquest. &&L/P&&R&&LP&&R&&LB&&RDavid Goldfarb&&L/B&&R teaches Polish, Russian, and Comparative Literature at Barnard College and Columbia University.
