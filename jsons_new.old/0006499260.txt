{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins Publishers Canada, Limited', 'synopsis': "Jack Aubrey returns from his duties protecting whalers off the South American coast and is persuaded by a casual acquaintance to make investments in the City on the strength of supposedly certain information. From there he is led into the half-worlds of the London criminal underground and of government espionage -- the province of his friend Stephen Maturin.<br/><br/>Devoted readers of Patrick O'Brian will find here all the brilliance of characterisation and all the sparkle of dialogue they have come to expect from a novelist often described as 'Jane Austen sur mer'. For those who will read him for the first time there will be the pleasure of discovering a novelist of unique character.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/68/9780006499268.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Reverse of the Medal', 'edition': '7th Impression', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.76 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.4629707502 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4629707502}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.76}}, 'pages': 286, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Sea Stories', 'British & Irish', 'Historical'], 'authors': ["Patrick O'Brian"], 'title': 'The Reverse of the Medal', 'isbn13': '9780006499268', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0006499260', 'isbn10': '0006499260'}}
