{'book': {'publisher': 'Warner Books', 'synopsis': 'When she catches the eye of a wealthy businessman, Jordan Hadlock\'s future is all planned out . . . until a hunky photographer ignites a new passion in her one stormy night.<br/><br/>Jordan Hadlock seems to have it all: a great job and Helmut Eckherdt, a rich industrialist intent on marrying her -- even though she hasn\'t said yes. What more could she want? A clap of thunder and a pounding on her door soon give her an answer.<br/><br/>Reeves Grant appears seeking shelter from a sudden downpour, but the real storm is inside Jordan and the passion they share. And the timing couldn\'t be worse: soon after that fateful night, Helmut publicly announces his plans to marry Jordan -- at the very same moment she spies Reeves snapping pictures of her new "fianc√©."<br/><br/>Now Jordan is moving toward the altar with a man she likes but doesn\'t love, with Reeves only a few inches away. Soon, she\'ll have to choose between them -- or risk losing both.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/13/9780446612913.jpg', 'title_long': 'Not Even for Love', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.21 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.21}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 200, 'date_published': '2004-04-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Billionaires'], 'authors': ['Sandra Brown'], 'title': 'Not Even for Love', 'isbn13': '9780446612913', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '044661291X', 'isbn10': '044661291X'}}
