{'book': {'publisher': 'Wiley', 'synopsis': 'A clever, thought-provoking guide that attacks common astronomical misconceptions<br/>What is Bad Astronomy? Anything that accidentally or intentionally mangles the basic principles of astronomy. And who is on the lookout for good examples of Bad Astronomy? The Bad Astronomer, of course, a/k/a professional astronomer Phil Plait. In Bad Astronomy, Plait clears up misconceptions and malarkey relating to our Earth, moon, and the wider Universe. Ranging from commonly misunderstood notions such as why the sky is blue and the reason we have seasons, to large-scale shenanigans such as the so-called moon landing hoax and UFO sightings, Bad Astronomy wipes the stardust from readers\' eyes to reveal just how the Universe works. Not only does Plait clearly explain the principles behind major concepts like the Big Bang, he leads readers to understand basics such as what makes the Moon look big when it rises and why the planets -- and astrology-- cannot directly influence our lives. Here is a fascinating and enlightening read for amateurs and experts alike. Bad Astronomy is the first volume in Wiley\'s "Bad Science" series; forthcoming titles will look at common misconceptions related to biology, weather, and the Earth.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/62/9780471409762.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Astrology to the Moon Landing "Hoax"', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.901557 Inches, Length: 5.999988 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 0.999998 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.999988}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.999998}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7495716908}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.901557}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2002-03-01', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Astronomy & Space Science', 'Astronomy', 'History & Philosophy', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching'], 'authors': ['Philip C.
