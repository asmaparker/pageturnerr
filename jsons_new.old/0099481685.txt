{'book': {'publisher': 'Arrow Books', 'synopsis': "Imagine a year without Christmas. No crowded shops, no corny office parties, no fruitcakes, no unwanted presents. That's just what Luther and Nora Krank have in mind when they decide that, just this once, they'll skip the holiday altogether. Theirs will be the only house on the street without a rooftop Frosty the snowman; they won't be hosting their annual Christmas Eve bash; they aren't even going to have a tree. They won't need one, because come December 25 they're setting sail on a Caribbean cruise. But, as this weary couple is about to discover, skipping Christmas brings enormous consequences - and isn't half as easy as they'd imagined.<br/><br/>A classic tale for modern times, Skipping Christmas offers a hilarious look at the chaos and frenzy that has become part of our holiday tradition.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/83/9780099481683.jpg', 'title_long': 'Skipping Christmas', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.00786 Inches, Length: 4.3307 Inches, Weight: 0.29321480846 Pounds, Width: 0.62992 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.3307}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.62992}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.29321480846}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.00786}}, 'pages': 200, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['John Grisham'], 'title': 'Skipping Christmas', 'isbn13': '9780099481683', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099481685', 'isbn10': '0099481685'}}
