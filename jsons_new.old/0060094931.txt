They have made their homes beneath the floorboards for generations and no longer remember—or even believe in—life beyond the Store walls.<br/>Until the day a small band of nomes arrives at the Store from the Outside. Led by a young nome named Masklin, the Outsiders carry a mysterious black box (called the Thing), and they deliver devastating news: In twenty-one days, the Store will be destroyed.<br/>Now all the nomes must learn to work together, and they must learn to think -- and to think BIG.<br/>Part satire, part parable, and part adventure story par excellence, master storyteller Terry Pratchett’s engaging trilogy traces the nomes’ flight and search for safety, a search that leads them to discover their own astonishing origins and takes them beyond their wildest dreams.<br/>Praise for the Bromeliad trilogy: “Witty, funny, wise, and altogether delightful.”—Locus Magazine<br/>Meet more of Sir Terry Pratchett’s tiny-but-fierce heroes in the Discworld novel The Wee Free Men!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/35/9780060094935.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Bromeliad Trilogy: Truckers, Diggers, and Wings', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.56 Pounds, Width: 1.53 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.53}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.56}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2003-09-30', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Humorous', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Terry Pratchett'], 'title': 'The Bromeliad Trilogy: Truckers, Diggers, and Wings', 'isbn13': '9780060094935', 'msrp': 15.13, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060094931', 'isbn10': '0060094931', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062193810', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}, {'isbn': '9780062193827', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
