If so, First Things First can help you understand why we so often prioritize things that are unimportant to both our larger goals and our inner happiness. From the author that brought you the New York Times bestseller The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People comes a guide to building your work on the principles of effectiveness so that your life can spent cultivating genuine relationships, investing in pursuits you enjoy, and achieving balance in both your personal and professional lives.<br/><br/>In First Things First, Stephen M. R. Covey advocates categorizing tasks by urgency and importance so that you can focus on what actually needs to be done in the limited amount of time that you have. Using personal examples and insight from years of business experience, he argues for a new way of looking at your “to-do” list. Rather than offering you another clock, First Things First provides you with a compass, because where you're headed is more important than how fast you're going.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/39/9780684802039.jpg', 'title_long': 'First Things First: To Live, to Love, to Learn, to Leave a Legacy', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.7495716908 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7495716908}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4375}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Skills', 'Time Management'], 'authors': ['Stephen R.', 'A.
