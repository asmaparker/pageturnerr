{'book': {'publisher': 'Dark Horse Manga', 'synopsis': "Eden Volume One is both a brilliant love song to the post-apocalyptic survival genre and the beginning of a deep exploration on man's role in the natural order. In the near future, a large portion of humanity is wiped out by a brutal, new virus that hardens the skin while dissolving internal organs. Those who aren't immune are either severely crippled or allowed to live with cybernetically enhanced bodies. Taking advantage of a world in chaos, a paramilitary force known as the Propater topples the United Nations and seeks world domination. Elia, a young survivor searching for his mother, travels towards the Andes Mountains with an artificially intelligent combat robot. When he encounters a group of anti-Propater freedom fighters, a maelstrom of unique characters unfolds. Graphic, cyberpunk, and philosophical, Eden is a place where endearing heroes face a constant struggle for survival and violent surprises wait around every corner!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/67/9781593074067.jpg', 'title_long': "Eden: It's An Endless World!, Vol. 1", 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.3 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.3}}, 'pages': 216, 'date_published': '2005-11-15', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Dystopian', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse'], 'authors': ['Hiroki Endo'], 'title': "Eden: It's An Endless World!, Vol. 1", 'isbn13': '9781593074067', 'msrp': 11.67, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1593074069', 'isbn10': '1593074069'}}
