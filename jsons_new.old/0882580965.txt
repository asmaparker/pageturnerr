{'book': {'publisher': 'Howard Univ Pr', 'synopsis': "The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one’s will by any means available. In relations between peoples, the question of power determines maneuverability in bargaining, the extent to which a people survive as a physical and cultural entity. When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society, that in itself is a form of underdevelopment.<br/>Before a bomb ended his life in the summer of 1980, Walter Rodney had created a powerful legacy. This pivotal work, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, had already brought a new perspective to the question of underdevelopment in Africa. his Marxist analysis went far beyond the heretofore accepted approach in the study of Third World underdevelopment. How Europe Underdeveloped Africa is an excellent introductory study for the student who wishes to better understand the dynamics of Africa’s contemporary relations with the West.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/68/9780882580968.jpg', 'title_long': 'How Europe Underdeveloped Africa', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 312, 'date_published': '1981', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic Conditions', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Human Geography', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Walter Rodney'], 'title': 'How Europe Underdeveloped Africa', 'isbn13': '9780882580968', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0882580965', 'isbn10': '0882580965'}}
