{'book': {'publisher': 'The MIT Press', 'synopsis': 'One of our most daring intellectuals offers a Lacanian interpretation of religion, finding that early Christianity was the first revolutionary collective.<br/>Slavoj Žižek has been called "an academic rock star" and "the wild man of theory"; his writing mixes astonishing erudition and references to pop culture in order to dissect current intellectual pieties. In The Puppet and the Dwarf he offers a close reading of today\'s religious constellation from the viewpoint of Lacanian psychoanalysis. He critically confronts both predominant versions of today\'s spirituality—New Age gnosticism and deconstructionist-Levinasian Judaism—and then tries to redeem the "materialist" kernel of Christianity. His reading of Christianity is explicitly political, discerning in the Pauline community of believers the first version of a revolutionary collective. Since today even advocates of Enlightenment like Jurgen Habermas acknowledge that a religious vision is needed to ground our ethical and political stance in a "postsecular" age, this book—with a stance that is clearly materialist and at the same time indebted to the core of the Christian legacy—is certain to stir controversy.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/58/9780262740258.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity (Short Circuits)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.44 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.44}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.54}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044933474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 196, 'date_published': '2003-08-29', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Bible Study & Reference', 'Criticism & Interpretation', 'Theology', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies', 'Philosophy', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology'], 'authors': ['Slavoj Zizek'], 'title': 'The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity (Short Circuits)', 'isbn13': '9780262740258', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0262261308', 'ePub': '0262261308'}, 'isbn': '0262740257', 'isbn10': '0262740257', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780262261302', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
