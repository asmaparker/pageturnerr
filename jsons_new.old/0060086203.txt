{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperEntertainment', 'synopsis': "The starship Oberon is searching for its AWOL pilot when it crash-lands on an unknown planet, leaving all but a handful of its crewmembers dead. And those who remain are not alone in this strange, inhospitable world. A savage insectile race waits just below the surface, massing to obliterate the unwanted invaders. And the Oberon's last human survivors must look to unlikely allies for help: the apes they carried onboard. Using controversial gene technology, the starship's scientists hope to transform the primates into a powerful army -- strong, agile, subservient...and intelligent. But the consequences of playing God promise to be more devastating than anyone could have ever anticipated, ushering in a dark and terrifying future that will pit slave against master, ape against Man.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/06/9780060086206.jpg', 'title_long': 'Planet of the Apes: The Fall', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2002-06-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['William T Quick'], 'title': 'Planet of the Apes: The Fall', 'isbn13': '9780060086206', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060086203', 'isbn10': '0060086203'}}
