Is she a sweet distraction from his serious duties—or the answer to his lonely heart?<br/><br/>Now that he has found his twin brother, all Tristan Saint-Laurent wants is to be a peaceful rancher. What he gets is Emily Starbuck, a determined package of trouble from back East. Tristan knows he should tell Emily and her aggravating sheep to move along, but he doesn’t have the heart.
