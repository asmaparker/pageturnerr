{'book': {'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'synopsis': "Peter Singer's remarkably clear and comprehensive Practical Ethics has become a classic introduction to applied ethics since its publication in 1979 and has been translated into many languages. For this second edition the author has revised all the existing chapters, added two new ones, and updated the bibliography. He has also added an appendix describing some of the deep misunderstanding of and consequent violent reaction to the book in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where the book has tested the limits of freedom of speech. The focus of the book is the application of ethics to difficult and controversial social questions.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/18/9780521439718.jpg', 'title_long': 'Practical Ethics', 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}}, 'pages': 395, 'date_published': '1993', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['SINGER P.'], 'title': 'Practical Ethics', 'isbn13': '9780521439718', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '052143971X', 'isbn10': '052143971X'}}
