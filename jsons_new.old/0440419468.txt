{'book': {'publisher': 'Yearling', 'synopsis': 'Stanley Yelnats is under a curse. A curse that began with his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnats. Now Stanley has been unjustly sent to a boys\' detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the warden makes the boys "build character" by spending all day, every day, digging holes: five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn\'t take long for Stanley to realize there\'s more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is looking for something. Stanley tries to dig up the truth in this inventive and darkly humorous tale of crime and punishmentâ€”and redemption.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/64/9780440419464.jpg', 'title_long': 'Holes', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2003-03-11', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Louis Sachar'], 'title': 'Holes', 'isbn13': '9780440419464', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0440419468', 'isbn10': '0440419468'}}
