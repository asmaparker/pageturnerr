{'book': {'publisher': 'University of Chicago Press', 'synopsis': "One of the most important figures of the American civil rights movement, Bayard Rustin taught Martin Luther King Jr. the methods of Gandhi, spearheaded the 1963 March on Washington, and helped bring the struggle of African Americans to the forefront of a nation's consciousness. But despite his incontrovertibly integral role in the movement, the openly gay Rustin is not the household name that many of his activist contemporaries are. In exploring history's Lost Prophet, acclaimed historian John D'Emilio explains why Rustin's influence was minimized by his peers and why his brilliant strategies were not followed, or were followed by those he never meant to help.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/92/9780226142692.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lost Prophet: The Life and Times of Bayard Rustin', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.73 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.73}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 592, 'date_published': '2004-10-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Historical', 'United States', 'History', 'Africa', 'Americas', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Communication & Media Studies', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science', 'Elections & Political Process', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ["John D'Emilio"], 'title': 'Lost Prophet: The Life and Times of Bayard Rustin', 'isbn13': '9780226142692', 'msrp': 31, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0226142698', 'isbn10': '0226142698'}}
