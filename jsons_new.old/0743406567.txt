{'book': {'publisher': 'Scribner', 'synopsis': "Empirically proving that—no matter where you are—kids wanna rock, this is Chuck Klosterman's hilrious memoir of growing up as a shameless metalhead in Wyndmere, North Dakotoa (population: 498).<br/><br/>With a voice like Ace Frehley's guitar, Klosterman hacks his way through hair-band history, beginning with that fateful day in 1983 when his older brother brought home Mötley Crüe's Shout at the Devil. The fifth-grade Chuck wasn't quite ready to rock—his hair was too short and his farm was too quiet—but he still found a way to bang his nappy little head. Before the journey was over, he would slow-dance to Poison, sleep innocently beneath satanic pentagrams, lust for Lita Ford, and get ridiculously intellectual about Guns N' Roses. C'mon and feel his noize.", 'language': 'es', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/67/9780743406567.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fargo rock city', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.57 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.57}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2014', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'History & Criticism', 'Musical Genres', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Composers & Musicians', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Journalists', 'Regional U.S.', 'Midwest', 'History', 'Americas', 'United States'], 'authors': ['Chuck Klosterman'], 'title': 'Fargo rock city', 'isbn13': '9780743406567', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '141658952X'}, 'isbn': '0743406567', 'isbn10': '0743406567', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416589525', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
