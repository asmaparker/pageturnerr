{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': '"Kundera, master of the twosome, finds erotic and existential threads everywhere in daily behavior. Like his previous books, Identity is a cluster of jeweled observations. . . . But Identity has a special charm: suspense. . . . [It] gets us turning the pages in excitement and alarm, and Kundera\'s wit keeps us turning them to the very end." — San Francisco Chronicle<br/>In a narrative as intense as it is brief, a moment of confusion sets in motion a complex chain of events which forces the reader to cross and recross the divide between fantasy and reality.<br/>Sometimes—perhaps only for an instant—we fail to recognize a companion; for a moment their identity ceases to exist, and thus we come to doubt our own. The effect is at its most acute in a couple, where our existence is given meaning by our perception of a lover, and theirs of us.<br/>With his astonishing skill at building on and out from the significant moment, Milan Kundera has placed such a situation and the resulting wave of panic at the core of this novel. Hailed as a "a fervent and compelling romance, a moving fable about the anxieties of love and separateness" (Baltimore Sun), it is not to be missed.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/41/9780060175641.jpg', 'title_long': 'Identity: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.73}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '1998-04-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Milan Kundera'], 'title': 'Identity: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060175641', 'msrp': 23, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060175648', 'isbn10': '0060175648'}}
