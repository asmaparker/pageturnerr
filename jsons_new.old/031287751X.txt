Kidd to create a startling look at the ethics of bioengineering<br/><br/>Lovelock is a capuchin monkey engineered to be the perfect servant--intelligent, agile, pliant, and devoted to his owner. He is a Witness--privileged to spend his days and nights observing the life of one of Earth's most brilliant scientists through digital recording devices behind his eyes. In his heart is the desire to please, not just to avoid the pain his owner can inflict with a word, but because he loves her.<br/><br/>Lovelock is on a voyage he did not choose. What human would consider the feelings of a capuchin monkey, no matter how enhanced? But Lovelock is something special among Witnesses--he's a little smarter than most humans; smart enough to break through some of his conditioning. Smart enough to feel the bonds of slavery, and want freedom.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/14/9780312877514.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lovelock (The Mayflower Trilogy Book 1)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.1401452 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.6039358 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.1401452}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6039358}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.21}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2001-02-10', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Animals', 'Science & Math', 'Evolution', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Colonization', 'Exploration'], 'authors': ['Orson Scott Card', 'Kathryn H.
