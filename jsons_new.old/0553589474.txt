But she is about to discover that fame is no protection at all when someone wants you dead.<br/><br/>All Emma has to do is close her eyes and she remembers the day Brian McAvoy swept into her life. A frightened toddler, she didn’t know then that she was his illegitimate daughter or that he was pop music’s rising new star. All she knew was that with Brian, his band mates, and his new wife, she felt safe. And when her baby brother arrived, Emma thought she was the luckiest girl in the world—until the night a botched kidnapping attempt shattered all their lives . . . and destroyed Emma’s happiness.<br/><br/>Yet now, even though Emma is still haunted by flashes of memory from that fateful night, she has survived. She’s carved out a thrilling career and even dared to fall rapturously in love. But the man who will become her husband isn’t all that he seems. And Emma is about to awaken to the chilling knowledge that the darkest secret of all is the one buried in her mind—a secret that someone may kill to keep.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/74/9780553589474.jpg', 'title_long': 'Public Secrets', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.88 Inches, Length: 4.16 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 1.11 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.16}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.11}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.88}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2012-03-27', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Romantic Suspense'], 'authors': ['Nora Roberts'], 'title': 'Public Secrets', 'isbn13': '9780553589474', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0553589474', 'isbn10': '0553589474'}}
