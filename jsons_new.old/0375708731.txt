{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "For readers who can’t get enough of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, Gore Vidal’s stunning novel about Aaron Burr, the man who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel—and who served as a successful, if often feared, statesman of our fledgling nation.<br/><br/>Here is an extraordinary portrait of one of the most complicated—and misunderstood—figures among the Founding Fathers. In 1804, while serving as vice president, Aaron Burr fought a duel with his political nemesis, Alexander Hamilton, and killed him. In 1807, he was arrested, tried, and acquitted of treason. In 1833, Burr is newly married, an aging statesman considered a monster by many. But he is determined to tell his own story, and he chooses to confide in a young New York City journalist named Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler. Together, they explore both Burr's past—and the continuing civic drama of their young nation.<br/><br/>Burr is the first novel in Gore Vidal's Narratives of Empire series, which spans the history of the United States from the Revolution to post-World War II. With their broad canvas and sprawling cast of fictional and historical characters, these novels present a panorama of American politics and imperialism, as interpreted by one of our most incisive and ironic observers.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/32/9780375708732.jpg', 'title_long': 'Burr: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.73 Pounds, Width: 0.91 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.91}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.73}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2000-02-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Political', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Gore Vidal'], 'title': 'Burr: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780375708732', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307798410', 'ePub': '0307798410'}, 'isbn': '0375708731', 'isbn10': '0375708731', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307798411', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
