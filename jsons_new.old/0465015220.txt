{'book': {'publisher': 'Basic Books', 'synopsis': 'In When Smoke Ran Like Water, the world-renowned epidemiologist Devra Davis confronts the public triumphs and private failures of her lifelong battle against environmental pollution. She documents the shocking toll of a public-health disaster-300,000 deaths a year in the U.S. and Europe from the effects of pollution-and asks why we remain silent. For Davis, the issue is personal: Pollution is what killed many in her family and forced some of the others, survivors of the 1948 smog emergency in Donora, Pennsylvania, to live out their lives with impaired health. She describes that episode and also makes startling revelations about how the deaths from the London smog of 1952 were falsely attributed to influenza; how the oil companies and auto manufacturers fought for decades to keep lead in gasoline, while knowing it caused brain damage; and many other battles. When Smoke Ran Like Water makes a devastating case for change.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/21/9780465015221.jpg', 'title_long': 'When Smoke Ran Like Water: Tales Of Environmental Deception And The Battle Against Pollution', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.7936641432 Pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.89}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7936641432}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 353, 'date_published': '2003-12-25', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Environmental Economics', 'Processes & Infrastructure', 'Green Business', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Civil & Environmental', 'Science & Math', 'Earth Sciences', 'Environmental Science', 'History & Philosophy', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Conservation', 'Environment', 'Environmentalism', 'Medical Books', 'Administration & Medicine Economics', 'Health Care Delivery', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'General', 'Sociology', 'Social Theory', 'Politics & Government', 'Public Affairs & Policy'], 'authors': ['Devra Davis'], 'title': 'When Smoke Ran Like Water: Tales Of Environmental Deception And The Battle Against Pollution', 'isbn13': '9780465015221', 'msrp': 18.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0465015220', 'isbn10': '0465015220'}}
