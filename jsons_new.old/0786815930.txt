His best friend, Alex, is trying to score vicariously through him; his brother is a giant pain; and his father keeps bugging him to get motivated. There is just one thing that really sets him apart for other kidsæhis father happens to be the head of a powerful crime organization. Needless to say, while Vince's family's connections can be handy for certain things-like when teachers are afraid to give him a bad grade as they can put a serious crimp in his dating life. How is he supposed to explain to a girl what his father does for a living? But when Vince finally meets one who seems to be worth the trouble, her family turns out to be the biggest problem of all. Because her father is an FBI agent-the one who wants to put his father away for good.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/37/9780786815937.jpg', 'title_long': 'Son of the Mob', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.625 Inches, Length: 5.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.625}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2004-09-01', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Gordon Korman'], 'title': 'Son of the Mob', 'isbn13': '9780786815937', 'msrp': 8.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0786815930', 'isbn10': '0786815930'}}
