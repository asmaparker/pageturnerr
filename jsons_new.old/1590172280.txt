{'book': {'publisher': 'NYRB Classics', 'synopsis': 'On the outskirts of Paris, a prostitute is found murdered in a vacant lot. In a seedy apartment house nearby lives pasty, fat Mr. Hire. Mr. Hire, who earns his living through a petty postal scam, is a convicted pornographer, a peeping Tom, and, once a week, the unlikely star of a Parisian bowling club, where people think he works for the police. He is a faceless man of regular habits who keeps to himself and gives his neighbors the creeps. After the murder, Mr. Hire’s concierge points a finger at him: he was out late the night of the crime. The police have the suspect under 24-hour surveillance. They are only waiting for him to make the inevitable mistake and give himself away.<br/><br/>Except that creepy Mr. Hire is in fact an innocent man, whose only mistake is to have fallen head-over-heels in love with the wrong girl.<br/><br/>One of the most chilling and compassionate of Simenon’s extraordinary psychological novels, The Engagement explores the mystery of a blameless heart in a compromised soul.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/85/9781590172285.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Engagement (New York Review Books Classics)', 'edition': 'Ex-Library', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.23 Inches, Weight: 0.33730726086 Pounds, Width: 0.36 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.23}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.36}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.33730726086}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.95}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Georges Simenon'], 'title': 'The Engagement (New York Review Books Classics)', 'isbn13': '9781590172285', 'msrp': 10.44, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1590172280', 'isbn10': '1590172280'}}
