{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': "Nobody knows more about the differences between the sexes than John Gray, Ph.D. He is the man America turns to for help in deciphering the myriad complexities men and women face daily in their interactions with each other. The author of nine bestsellers--including the history-making Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus--John Gray expands on the expert advice touched upon in his previous books and distills each message into a powerful, inspiring daily meditation in this newest volume.<br/>There's no doubt about it: The relationship between men and women is extremely complex. We often forget just how different the sexes are, and become frustrated and confused by a loved one's behavior. Every day we need to be reminded of these differences and realize that it's okay to be different as long as we recognize and understand the behavior of the opposite sex. In Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days, John Gray provides us with daily inspirations that lovingly and insightfully remind us of the contrasts between Mars and Venus, allowing us to solve conflicts in our relationships.<br/>Each month is devoted to a single theme, with the daily meditations enlarging on the particular subject at hand. The topics correlate with the very traits of the month itself: January, an exhilarating time of new beginnings, inspires resolve and the desire to excel. In February, when we find ourselves deep in winter's grip and challenged by constant emotional upheaval, we seek reminders of the importance of commitment and the need for patience. May concentrates on such springtime issues as harmony and appreciation. The topics discussed are as diverse as relationships are.<br/>Inside you'll find comforting and helpful advice on:<br/>The true meaning of equality<br/>Improving communication<br/>Giving and receiving emotional support<br/>The awakening of our inner qualities<br/>Needing time alone<br/>Keeping the passion alive<br/>Reacting to stress<br/>Whether you need the thoughtful reminders yourself or know a friend or loved one who will benefit from these beautiful reflections, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days is a classic that no bookshelf should be without.<br/>The Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days contains 365 inspirations to remind you each day of the basic differences between men and women<br/>Women love a man with a plan; men love a woman with a smile.<br/>A woman is like a wave. When she feels loved, her self-esteem rises and falls like a wave in motion. When she is feeling really good, she will reach a peak, but then suddenly her mood may change and her wave crashes down. This crash is temporary. After she reaches bottom, her mood will shift suddenly, and she will again feel good about herself. Automatically, her wave begins to rise back up...By recognizing this pattern, a man doesn't take it personally. When he doesn't feel as if he is being blamed for her downs, he can be more supportive.<br/>A rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle, which involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again...Most women are surprised to realize that even when a man loves a woman, periodically he needs to pull away before he can get closer. Men instinctively feel this urge to pull away. It is not a decision or a choice. It just happens. It is neither his fault nor her fault. It is a natural cycle.<br/>Romance for women is when a man does things without her having to ask; romance for men is when a woman appreciates the things he does.<br/>Showing interest is one of the most important secrets to opening a woman's heart.<br/>A man is free to be the best he can be when he feels accepted just the way he is.<br/>Women need to work on trusting, while men need to work on caring.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/78/9780060192778.jpg', 'title_long': 'Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days: 365 Inspirations to Enrich Your Relationships', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.22136093148 Pounds, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.22136093148}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '1998-10-21', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Love & Romance', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences'], 'authors': ['John Gray'], 'title': 'Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days: 365 Inspirations to Enrich Your Relationships', 'isbn13': '9780060192778', 'msrp': 23, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060192771', 'isbn10': '0060192771'}}
