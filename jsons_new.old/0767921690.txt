{'book': {'publisher': 'Crown', 'synopsis': 'For those intimidated by the complexity of personal interaction, or those simply looking to polish their speaking skills, The Art of Civilized Conversation is a powerful guide to communicating in an endearing way.<br/><br/>In our fast-paced, electronic society, the most basic social interaction—talking face-to-face—can be a challenge for even the most educated and self-assured individuals. And yet making conversation is a highly practical skill: those who do it well shine at networking parties, interviews, and business lunches. Good conversation also opens doors to a happier love life, warmer friendships, and more rewarding time with family.<br/><br/>In The Art of Civilized Conversation, author Margaret Shepherd offers opening lines, graceful apologies, thoughtful questions, and, ultimately, the confidence to take conversations beyond hello. From the basics—first impressions, appropriate subject matter, and graceful exits—to finding the right words for difficult situations and an insightful discussion of body language, Shepherd uses her skilled eye and humorous anecdotes to teach readers how to turn a plain conversation into an engaging encounter.<br/><br/>Filled with common sense and fresh insight, The Art of Civilized Conversation is the perfect inspiration not only for what to say but for how to say it with style.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/95/9780767921695.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Art of Civilized Conversation: A Guide to Expressing Yourself With Style and Grace', 'edition': 'NO-VALUE', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.44 Inches, Length: 5.26 Inches, Weight: 0.63713593718 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.26}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.85}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63713593718}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.44}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2005-12-27', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Reference', 'Etiquette', 'Etiquette Guides & Advice', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Communication', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Communication & Media Studies'], 'authors': ['Margaret Shepherd'], 'title': 'The Art of Civilized Conversation: A Guide to Expressing Yourself With Style and Grace', 'isbn13': '9780767921695', 'msrp': 11.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0307419339'}, 'isbn': '0767921690', 'isbn10': '0767921690', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307419330', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
