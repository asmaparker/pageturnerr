Soon Susan finds herself in a race against time, for not only does the killer stalk these lonely women, but he seems intent on eliminating anyone who can possibly further Susan’s investigation.<br/><br/>As her search intensifies, Susan finds herself confronted with the realization that one of the men who have become important figures in her life might actually be the killer. And as she gets closer to uncovering his identity, she realizes almost too late that the hunter has become the hunted. Is she the next one marked for murder?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/45/9780671004545.jpg', 'title_long': 'You Belong To Me', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.000881849048 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.000881849048}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 373, 'date_published': '1999-04-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'Psychological', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Mary Higgins Clark'], 'title': 'You Belong To Me', 'isbn13': '9780671004545', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0743206290'}, 'isbn': '0671004549', 'isbn10': '0671004549', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780743206297', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
