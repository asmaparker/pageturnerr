{'book': {'publisher': 'Yale University Press', 'synopsis': "First published in 1516, Saint Thomas More's Utopia is one of the most important works of European humanism. Through the voice of the mysterious traveler Raphael Hythloday, More describes a pagan, communist city-state governed by reason. Addressing such issues as religious pluralism, women's rights, state-sponsored education, colonialism, and justified warfare, Utopia seems remarkably contemporary nearly five centuries after it was written, and it remains a foundational text in philosophy and political theory.<br/>Preeminent More scholar Clarence H. Miller does justice to the full range of More's rhetoric in this new translation. Professor Miller includes a helpful introduction that outlines some of the important problems and issues that Utopia raises, and also provides informative commentary to assist the reader throughout this challenging and rewarding exploration of the meaning of political community.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/90/9780300084290.jpg', 'title_long': 'Utopia: Thomas More', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 4.75 Inches, Weight: 0.3527396192 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3527396192}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2001-03-01', 'subjects': ['History', 'World', 'Civilization & Culture', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Medieval Thought', 'Movements', 'Political'], 'authors': ['Thomas More'], 'title': 'Utopia: Thomas More', 'isbn13': '9780300084290', 'msrp': 8.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0300084293', 'isbn10': '0300084293'}}
