Tolkien's enthralling account of the writing of the Book of the Century which contains many additional scenes and includes the unpublished Epilogue in its entirety.<br/>The Return of the Shadow is the story of the first part of the history of the creation of The Lord of the Rings, a fascinating study of Tolkien’s great masterpiece, from its inception to the end of the first volume, The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/>In The Return of the Shadow (the abandoned title of the first volume of The Lord of the Rings) we see how Bilbo’s magic ring evolved into the supremely dangerous Ruling Ring of the Dark Lord; and the precise, and astonishingly unforeseen, moment when a Black Rider first rode in to the Shire. The character of the hobbit called Trotter (afterwards Strider or Aragorn) is developed, and Frodo’s companions undergo many changes of name and personality.<br/>The book comes complete with reproductions of the first maps and facsimile pages from the earliest manuscripts.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/72/9780618083572.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Return of the Shadow: The History of The Lord of the Rings, Part One (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 6) (History of Middle-earth, 6)', 'edition': '1ST HOUGHT', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.94125 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.94125}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 497, 'date_published': '2000-09-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Literary', 'Mythology & Folk Tales', 'Folklore', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'History & Criticism', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Dragons & Mythical Creatures'], 'authors': ['J.
