{'book': {'publisher': 'WestBow Press Oct - 2004', 'synopsis': "From before the time of Christ, there have been rumors of a secret society called The Illuminati...a vicious tribe of Druids with mystical, supernatural powers. Many saw them as demons or gods. Those who opposed them simply disappeared...or met an even worse fate.<br/>Unknown to all but the very few, this group slowly infiltrated world organizations and financial institutions with a singular goal--to control the world's economic system.<br/>Now fast-forward to the year 2020. The Illuminati has succeeded in placing one of their people in the office of the presidency of the United States. With the worldwide launch of a financial system known as Data-Net, they suddenly have the power to single out groups of people and control their money, fuel, and food supply. How do you escape an unknown enemy operating at the highest levels who can track your every move? And how do you defeat a society that practices ancient rituals and appears to have power beyond the grave?<br/>The Illuminati<br/>is a futuristic thriller tied to ancient mysticism that will appeal to fans of The DaVinci Code and the Left Behind series. It will also leave readers wondering where fact ends and fiction begins.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/10/9781595540010.jpg', 'title_long': '[ [ [ The Illuminati [ THE ILLUMINATI ] By Burkett, Larry ( Author )Oct-06-2004 Paperback', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.80027801106 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.80027801106}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '1692', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['Larry Burkett'], 'title': '[ [ [ The Illuminati [ THE ILLUMINATI ] By Burkett, Larry ( Author )Oct-06-2004 Paperback', 'isbn13': '9781595540010', 'msrp': 10.19, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1418512656'}, 'isbn': '1595540016', 'isbn10': '1595540016', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781418512651', 'binding': 'saleableprint'}]}}
