Then, one cold spring morning, Cory and his father witness a car plunge into a lake—and a desperate rescue attempt brings his father face-to-face with a terrible vision of death that will haunt him forever.<br/><br/>As Cory struggles to understand his father’s pain, his eyes are slowly opened to the forces of good and evil that are manifested in Zephyr. From an ancient, mystical woman who can hear the dead and bewitch the living, to a violent clan of moonshiners, Cory must confront the secrets that hide in the shadows of his hometown—for his father’s sanity and his own life hang in the balance.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/55/9780671743055.jpg', 'title_long': "Boy's Life", 'edition': '1st Pocket Books Ppbk Printing, May 1992', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.59965735264 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59965735264}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 608, 'date_published': '1992-05-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Metaphysical & Visionary', 'Coming of Age', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Supernatural', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['Robert McCammon'], 'title': "Boy's Life", 'isbn13': '9780671743055', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0671743058', 'isbn10': '0671743058'}}
