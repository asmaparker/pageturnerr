{'book': {'publisher': 'Aladdin', 'synopsis': "In this quintessential adventure story, Jack London takes readers on an arduous journey through the forbidding Alaskan landscape during the gold rush of the 1890s. Buck, a rangy mixed breed used to a comfortable, sun-filled life as a family dog, is stolen by a greedy opportunist and sold to dog traffickers. In no time, Buck finds himself on a team of sled dogs run ragged in the harsh winter of the Klondike. In a climate where every day is a savage struggle for survival, the last traces of Buck's soft, pampered existence are erased as his dormant primordial urges - deeply embedded for generations - are brutally awakened. The superb detail, taken from London's firsthand knowledge of Alaskan frontier life, makes this classic tale as gripping today as it was almost a hundred years ago. No other novel has so clearly shown the fragile separation between tame and wild, between man and beast. Now, paired with master illustrator Wendell Minor's exquisite paintings, this timeless story is available in a handsome new addition to the Scribner Illustrated Classics collection.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/63/9780689818363.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Call of the Wild (Scribner Classics)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.8046872563 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8046872563}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '1999-10-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors': ['Jack London'], 'title': 'The Call of the Wild (Scribner Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780689818363', 'msrp': 29, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '068981836X', 'isbn10': '068981836X'}}
