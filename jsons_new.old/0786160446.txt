{'book': {'publisher': 'Blackstone Audio', 'synopsis': "The preeminent popular history of civilization's rebirth after the Dark Ages<br/>From tales of chivalrous knights to the barbarity of trial by ordeal, no era has been a greater source of awe, horror, and wonder than the Middle Ages. In handsomely crafted prose and with the grace and authority of his extraordinary gift for narrative history, William Manchester leads us from a civilization tottering on the brink of collapse to the grandeur of its rebirth, the Renaissance, a dense explosion of energy that spawned some of history's greatest poets, philosophers, and painters, as well as some of its most spectacular villains.<br/>One of the most volatile periods of western history witnessed the passing of the Dark Ages and the dawning of the Renaissance, illuminated by magnificent scientific and artistic achievements and spectacular leaps of thought and imagination. Manchester's narrative weaves together extraordinary figures, varied elements, and accomplishments of the period.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/40/9780786160440.jpg', 'title_long': 'A World Lit Only By Fire: The Medieval Mind and the Renaissance; Portrait of an Age', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.76 Inches, Length: 5.3 Inches, Weight: 0.67 Pounds, Width: 1.45 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.45}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.67}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.76}}, 'date_published': '2007-03-01', 'subjects': ['History', 'Ancient Civilizations', 'Europe'], 'authors': ['William Manchester'], 'title': 'A World Lit Only By Fire: The Medieval Mind and the Renaissance; Portrait of an Age', 'isbn13': '9780786160440', 'msrp': 29.95, 'binding': 'Audio CD', 'isbn': '0786160446', 'isbn10': '0786160446'}}
