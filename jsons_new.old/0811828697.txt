{'book': {'publisher': 'Chronicle Books', 'synopsis': "Designed as a naturalist's sketch book (with a genuine dewback hide cover) and featuring the meticulous illustrations of Star Wars' artist Terryl Whitlatch, The Wildlife of Star Wars is truly the definitive guide to the creatures of George Lucas's mega creation. With simple pen and ink, the artist captures the unusual anatomy, the extraordinary behavior, and the rainbow hues of the most interesting wildlife on Naboo, Hoth, Endor, and the other planets of Star Wars. Detailed field notes scrawled in the margins describe the mysterious graveyard of the banthas, the mating patterns of the prolific female shaaks, the skittish nature of the rontos, and how the eopies spit stomach contents when irritated. Thorough, precise, and totally entertaining, The Wildlife of Star Wars is the reference book to the nonsentient inhabitants of this galaxy. While the reader can't hear the booming thunder of the bantha stampede or smell the rancid breath of the bellowing falumpaset, he or she can observe these creatures as they exist in their strange and wonderful homes, in a galaxy far, far away.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/97/9780811828697.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 12.3 inches, Length: 10.3 inches, Weight: 3.12615487516 Pounds, Width: 1 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.12615487516}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 12.3}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2001-09-01', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'History & Criticism', 'Pop Culture', 'Art', 'Reference'], 'authors': ['Terryl Whitlatch', 'Bob Carrau'], 'title': 'The Wildlife of Star Wars: A Field Guide', 'isbn13': '9780811828697', 'msrp': 40, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0811828697', 'isbn10': '0811828697'}}
