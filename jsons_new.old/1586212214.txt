{'book': {'publisher': 'Grand Central Publishing', 'synopsis': 'In David Sedaris\' world, no one is safe and no cow is sacred. A manic cross between Mark Leyner, Fran Lebowitz, and the National Enquirer, Sedaris\' collection of essays is a rollicking tour through the national Zeitgeist: a do-it-yourself suburban dad saves money by performing home surgery; a man who is loved too much flees the heavyweight champion of the world; a teenage suicide tries to incite a lynch mob at her funeral; a bitter Santa abuses the elves.<br/><br/>David Sedaris made his debut on NPR\'s Morning Edition with "SantaLand Diaries", recounting his strange-but-true experiences as an elf at Macy\'s, and soon became one of the show\'s most popular commentators. With a perfect eye and a voice infused with as much empathy as wit, Sedaris writes stories and essays that target the soulful ridiculousness of our behavior. Barrel Fever is like a blind date with modern life, and anything can happen.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/16/9781586212216.jpg', 'title_long': 'Barrel Fever and Other Stories', 'edition': 'Abridged', 'dimensions': 'height: 146 mm, length: 133 mm, width: 19 mm, weight: 91 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 133}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 19}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 91}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 146}}, 'pages': 3, 'date_published': '2001-10-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous'], 'authors': ['David Sedaris'], 'title': 'Barrel Fever and Other Stories', 'isbn13': '9781586212216', 'msrp': 21.35, 'binding': 'Audio CD', 'isbn': '1586212214', 'isbn10': '1586212214'}}
