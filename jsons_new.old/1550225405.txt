Four years later, the show is still a smash hit and a critical darling; Angel has returned and then gone on to his own eponymous spin-off show; Buffy has graduated from high school, entered university, found a sister, lost her mother, and died only to be resurrected in the sixth season by her friends. Now on UPN, the former WB show is the top-rated non-WWF show on the network. It has appeared in almost every critics year-end top 10 list, and every time Emmy season rolls around and Buffy is snubbed again, critics use their column space to lambaste the academy for its shallow vision. Bite Me! includes: all the cast bios and episode guides from the original book updated bios of new cast members who have become major characters on the show an episode guide that features all six seasons of Buffy capsule reviews of the full first three seasons of Angel, with more emphasis put on the crossover episodes between the two shows.It will also look at how the show has affected popular culture, making its way onto university courses in the United States and spawning a book of academic essays.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/02/9781550225402.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bite Me!: An Unofficial Guide to the World of Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.79897205792 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.79897205792}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 450, 'date_published': '2002-09-01', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Television', 'Guides & Reviews', 'Shows'], 'authors': ['Nikki Stafford'], 'title': 'Bite Me!: An Unofficial Guide to the World of Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'isbn13': '9781550225402', 'msrp': 17.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1550225405', 'isbn10': '1550225405'}}
