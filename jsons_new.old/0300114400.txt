{'book': {'publisher': 'Yale University Press', 'synopsis': 'The first collection of Mark Rothko’s writings, which range the entire span of his career<br/><br/>While the collected writings of many major 20th-century artists, including Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell, and Ad Reinhardt, have been published, Mark Rothko’s writings have only recently come to light, beginning with the critically acclaimed The Artist’s Reality: Philosophies of Art. Rothko’s other written works have yet to be brought together into a major publication. Writings on Art fills this significant void; it includes some 90 documents—including short essays, letters, statements, and lectures—written by Rothko over the course of his career. The texts are fully annotated, and a chronology of the artist’s life and work is also included.<br/><br/>This provocative compilation of both published and unpublished writings from 1934--69 reveals a number of things about Rothko: the importance of writing for an artist who many believed had renounced the written word; the meaning of transmission and transition that he experienced as an art teacher at the Brooklyn Jewish Center Academy; his deep concern for meditation and spirituality; and his private relationships with contemporary artists (including Newman, Motherwell, and Clyfford Still) as well as journalists and curators.<br/><br/>As was revealed in Rothko’s The Artist’s Reality, what emerges from this collection is a more detailed picture of a sophisticated, deeply knowledgeable, and philosophical artist who was also a passionate and articulate writer.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/09/9780300114409.jpg', 'title_long': 'Writings on Art', 'edition': 'Annotated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.72 Inches, Length: 9.3 Inches, Weight: 1.04940036712 Pounds, Width: 6.32 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.32}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04940036712}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}}, 'pages': 172, 'date_published': '2006-04-28', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Individual Artists', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism', 'History'], 'authors': ['Mark Rothko'], 'title': 'Writings on Art', 'isbn13': '9780300114409', 'msrp': 32, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0300114400', 'isbn10': '0300114400'}}
