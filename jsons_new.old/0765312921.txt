{'book': {'publisher': 'Tor Books', 'synopsis': "Hunters of Dune and the concluding volume, Sandworms of Dune, bring together the great story lines and beloved characters in Frank Herbert's classic Dune universe, ranging from the time of the Butlerian Jihad to the original Dune series and beyond. Based directly on Frank Herbert's final outline, which lay hidden in a safe-deposit box for a decade, these two volumes will finally answer the urgent questions Dune fans have been debating for two decades.<br/><br/>At the end of Chapterhouse: Dune--Frank Herbert's final novel--a ship carrying the ghola of Duncan Idaho, Sheeana (a young woman who can control sandworms), and a crew of various refugees escapes into the uncharted galaxy, fleeing from the monstrous Honored Matres, dark counterparts to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. The nearly invincible Honored Matres have swarmed into the known universe, driven from their home by a terrifying, mysterious Enemy. As designed by the creative genius of Frank Herbert, the primary story of Hunters and Sandworms is the exotic odyssey of Duncan's no-ship as it is forced to elude the diabolical traps set by the ferocious, unknown Enemy. To strengthen their forces, the fugitives have used genetic technology from Scytale, the last Tleilaxu Master, to revive key figures from Dune's past--including Paul Muad'Dib and his beloved Chani, Lady Jessica, Stilgar, Thufir Hawat, and even Dr. Wellington Yueh. Each of these characters will use their special talents to meet the challenges thrown at them.<br/><br/>Failure is unthinkable--not only is their survival at stake, but they hold the fate of the entire human race in their hands.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/21/9780765312921.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hunters of Dune', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.24 Inches, Length: 6.42 Inches, Weight: 1.75 Pounds, Width: 1.49 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.42}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.49}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.24}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '2006-08-22', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Opera'], 'authors': ['Kevin J Anderson', 'Brian Herbert'], 'title': 'Hunters of Dune', 'isbn13': '9780765312921', 'msrp': 27.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0765312921', 'isbn10': '0765312921'}}
