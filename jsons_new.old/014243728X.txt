{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': '“A real contribution to the study of Faulkner’s work.” —Edmund Wilson<br/><br/>A Penguin Classic<br/><br/>In prose of biblical grandeur and feverish intensity, William Faulkner reconstructed the history of the American South as a tragic legend of courage and cruelty, gallantry and greed, futile nobility and obscene crimes. He set this legend in a small, minutely realized parallel universe that he called Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi.<br/><br/>No single volume better conveys the scope of Faulkner’s vision than The Portable Faulkner. The book includes self-contained episodes from the novels The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, and Sanctuary; the stories “The Bear,” “Spotted Horses,” “A Rose for Emily,” and “Old Man,” among others; a map of Yoknapatawpha County and a chronology of the Compson family created by Faulkner especially for this edition; and the complete text of Faulkner’s 1950 address upon receiving the Nobel Prize in literature. Malcolm Cowley’s critical introduction was praised as “splendid” by Faulkner himself.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
