{'book': {'publisher': 'Bantam Skylark', 'synopsis': 'When James was a small boy, his parents died, and he had to go and live with his wicked aunts. For years he dreamed of getting away from them...until a strange little man gave James some magic green things and scurried away. James accidentally spilled the green things under the peach tree and resigned himself to permanent misery. Then a huge peach appeared on top of the tree! It grew until it was the size of a small house. Crawling inside, James met some other creatures who had been transformed by the magic, like the Grasshopper, the Ladybug, and the grumpy Centipede, whose razor-sharp jaws severed the peach stem and sent them all rolling down the hill into the sea. And then the adventure really began.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/22/9780553150322.jpg', 'title_long': 'James and the Giant Peach', 'edition': '3d ptg.', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.45 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}}, 'pages': 154, 'date_published': '1978', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'British & Irish', 'Action & Adventure'], 'authors': ['Ronald Dahl'], 'title': 'James and the Giant Peach', 'isbn13': '9780553150322', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0553150324', 'isbn10': '0553150324'}}
