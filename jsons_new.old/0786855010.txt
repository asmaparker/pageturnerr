They've heard all about the gas-powered spud gun she keeps hidden under her desk-make so much as a sound in her library and you could get spudded with soggy potatoes. Laugh out loud and you may never be seen again . . . And now, in a major coup of parental injustice, Will and his older brother, Marty, have been ordered to spend their summer vacation in Spud's library! Will brothers Will and Marty survive a summer marooned on the carpet of Spud's children's section, under the watchful eye of this terrifying librarian? Or will they discover a new interest that surprises even them?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/18/9780786855018.jpg', 'title_long': "The Legend of Spud Murphy (Eoin Colfer's Legend Of...)", 'edition': 'First Editiion', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.63 Pounds, Width: 0 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '2004-09-13', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Chapter Books & Readers', 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Eoin Colfer'], 'title': "The Legend of Spud Murphy (Eoin Colfer's Legend Of...)", 'isbn13': '9780786855018', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0786855010', 'isbn10': '0786855010'}}
