{'book': {'publisher': 'Merrill', 'synopsis': 'Based on the idea that childhood professionals, like physicians, should first, do no harm, this popular, reader-friendly book exemplifies a positive, constructivist approach to guidance that respects, protects, and helps children become self-responsible, competent, independent, cooperative people who like themselves and have strong values. Content is organized around three styles of caregiving: authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive; and based on a solid understanding of child development. The author never mandates a cookbook of techniques for guiding children; but, encourages readers to use the Decision-Making Model of Child Guidance, a model that evolves from an understanding of a variety of child guidance theories, including those of Piaget, Vygotsky, Rogers, and Adler. For individuals employed and involved, in any capacity, in the guidance and management of young children.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/17/9780023760617.jpg', 'title_long': 'Guidance of Young Children', 'edition': 'Fourth Edition First Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 0.75 Inches, Weight: 1.10892517786 Pounds, Width: 7.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.10892517786}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 307, 'date_published': '1995', 'subjects': ['Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Child Psychology', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Counseling', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Marian Marion'], 'title': 'Guidance of Young Children', 'isbn13': '9780023760617', 'msrp': 35.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0023760613', 'isbn10': '0023760613'}}
