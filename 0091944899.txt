{'book': {'publisher': 'Ebury Press', 'synopsis': 'From the star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding comes a heartwarming memoir of an everyday girl who falls in love with and marries a gypsy boy<br/>"I felt like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and all the other fairy-tale princesses, and Pat was my Prince Charming."<br/>Sam Skye Lee had often thought about getting married, but never imagined that her dress would be bright pink with flashing lights and weigh a staggering 20-stone. But then she didn\'t count on having a gypsy wedding. It\'s rare for a "gorger," or nontraveler, to marry into the gypsy community, but after a shocking childhood tragedy, Sam found the comfort she needed from an unexpected sourceâ€”Patrick and his family of travelers. This is a true story of how an ordinary girl finds herself discovering an extraordinary world, one where "grabbing" is a sign a boy fancies you, six-year-olds get spray tans, and christenings, weddings, and funerals are jaw-droppingly flamboyant. More than "boy meets girl," this love story is about a girl who falls in love with a whole race of people and their wonderful ways.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/96/9780091944896.jpg', 'title_long': 'gypsy-bride', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2012', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Memoirs'], 'authors': ['lee-sam-skye'], 'title': 'gypsy-bride', 'isbn13': '9780091944896', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0091944899', 'isbn10': '0091944899'}}
