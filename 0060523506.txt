{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "For decades, the oppressive North Korean beast has been secretly building up its arsenal of destruction, waiting for the right opportunity to launch a second full-scale assault on its wary neighbor to the south. That time is now. War looms on the horizon. And all that stands in the way is a small team of U.S. Recon Marines ready to dive into the abyss, weapons blazing. Making their jump just moments before their C-130 transport is obliterated by a missile strike, Team Dogma is stranded in a land of enemiesâ€”dogged by the crack-commando squads of the Axis of Evil's most dangerous arm and forced to make split-second life-or-death choices every step of the way. Because only Dogma can prevent the deployment of a devastating weapon that is, even now, locked, loaded . . . and aimed at the heart of Seoul.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/03/9780060523503.jpg', 'title_long': 'Force 5 Recon: Deployment: North Korea', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2004-02-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'War', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'War & Military', 'United States', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics'], 'authors': ['P.
