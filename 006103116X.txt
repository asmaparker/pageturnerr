With unapologetic honesty, and inimitable style, The Rock tells his story from his boyhood days traveling around the world with his father (professional wrestler Rocky Johnson) to his years as a football player at the University of Miami and his less than glamorous professional days in Canada, to his meteoric rise through the ranks of the Federation. The Rock also takes fans on a guided tour of big-time wrestling, and provides a breathtaking, minute-by-minute account of WrestleMania, the Super Bowl of pro wrestling, including an intimate backstage look at rehearsals with his opponent, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and discusses in heartfelt detail the loss of his friend and coworker, Owen Hart.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/68/9780061031168.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Rock Says...', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.52 Pounds, Width: 0.86 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.52}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2000-11-07', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Biographies', 'Boxing, Wrestling & MMA', 'Individual Sports', 'Wrestling'], 'authors': ['The Rock', 'Joe Layden'], 'title': 'The Rock Says...', 'isbn13': '9780061031168', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '006103116X', 'isbn10': '006103116X'}}
