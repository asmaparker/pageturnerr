{'book': {'publisher': 'ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute', 'synopsis': 'What is being done to counter threats of maritime terrorism and how effective are the safeguards? The author presents evidence that Al-Qaeda aims to disrupt the seaborne trading system, the backbone of the model global economy, and would use a crude nuclear explosive device or radiological bomb to do so if it could obtain one and position it to go off in a port-city, shipping strait or waterway that plays a key role in international trade. Improving maritime trade is especially important for the US and Canada, member states of the EU, Australia and New Zealand and for China, Japan and South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and other East Asian economies that have extensive direct seaborne trade. It is doubly vital for places like Singapore, Hong Kong and Rotterdam that are not only very large global seaports but also giant giant container transshipment hubs. This book discusses some major threats to seaborne trade and its land links in the global supply chain, their potential impact and the new security measures in place or pending for ships, ports and cargo containers, and recommendations for preventing or handling a catastrophic terrorist attack designed to disrupt world trade.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/65/9789812302465.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Time Bomb for Global Trade: Maritime-Related Terrorism in an Age of Weapons of Mass Destruction', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 0.41 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.41}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2004-03-05', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Michael Richardson'], 'title': 'A Time Bomb for Global Trade: Maritime-Related Terrorism in an Age of Weapons of Mass Destruction', 'isbn13': '9789812302465', 'msrp': 23.16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9812302468', 'isbn10': '9812302468'}}
