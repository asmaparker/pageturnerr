{'book': {'publisher': 'Allyn & Bacon', 'synopsis': 'As its title implies, this book deals with revising, not with original composition. Stressing the importance of the single sentence, The Paramedic Method of revision provides an easily learned method of revision to combat the obscurities of meaning that plague The Official Style, and demonstrates how to revise this stilted, dense prose into plain English. This book has been used with success wherever extensive writing is required, and also at every level of higher education. Addresses the specific stylistic patterns that characterize most bad writing and gives an eight-step revision method called The Paramedic Method to break those patterns and improve writing. Helps with writing tasks in business, government, and the university, where The Official Style is rampant, and provides an indispensable guide to revising in every writing context. For anyone interested in revising, specifically at the sentence level.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/57/9780023674457.jpg', 'title_long': 'Revising Prose', 'edition': '3', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 0.25 Inches, Weight: 0.3417165061 Pounds, Width: 5.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3417165061}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 85, 'date_published': '1991', 'subjects': ['Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Richard Lanham'], 'title': 'Revising Prose', 'isbn13': '9780023674457', 'msrp': 28, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0023674458', 'isbn10': '0023674458'}}
