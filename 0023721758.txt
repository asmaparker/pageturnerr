{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall College Div', 'synopsis': "This fascinating volume goes beyond historical information and puts readers in the place of the people who live by each religion, viewing their unique world through sacred stories, worldviews, rituals and ethical values, and notions of quality of life. To accomplish this, author Theodore M. Ludwig combines discussion of historical matters with a thematic approach based on general questions that arise out of human experience such as personal identity, human existence, wholeness, and the right way to live. Thoroughly revised and updated, The Sacred Paths, Second Edition, incorporates additional material on artistic expressions in the different religions; features an increased awareness of women's experiences and leadership roles as they pertain to the various religious traditions; includes a chapter-length treatment devoted to the rise of new religious movement; and provides definitions of key terms with the discussion of each religion. Maps, timelines, discussion questions, and suggestions for further readings are just a few of the study features included in this volume to help students understand the highly complex nature of the various religions under discussion.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/55/9780023721755.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sacred Paths, The: Understanding the Religions of the World', 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 1.25 Inches, Weight: 1.543235834 Pounds, Width: 8.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.543235834}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 574, 'date_published': '1995-11-20', 'subjects': ['History', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies'], 'authors': ['Theodore M.
