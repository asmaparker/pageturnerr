{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "There's something about almost dying that makes a girl rethink her priorities. Take Nicki Styx--she was strictly goth and vintage, until a brush with the afterlife leaves her with the ability to see dead people.<br/><br/>Before you can say boo, Atlanta's ghosts are knocking on her door. A friend foolishly sells her soul to the Devil, then winds up dead, and Nicki's dubious new gift of talking with the spirits lands her in some very deep voodoo. The doctor who saved Nicki's life seems to think she may have suffered brain damage, yet still seems eager for one-on-one anatomy lessons... what in the world is a newly-minted psychic ghoul to do?<br/><br/>Nicki always thought that death was the end, but she learns that for some, it's only the beginning.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/53/9780061136153.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dead Girls Are Easy (Nicki Styx, Book 1)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.3968320716 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3968320716}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2007-08-28', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Paranormal'], 'authors': ['Terri Garey'], 'title': 'Dead Girls Are Easy (Nicki Styx, Book 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061136153', 'msrp': 4.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061136158', 'isbn10': '0061136158'}}
