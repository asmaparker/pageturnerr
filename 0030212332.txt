{'book': {'publisher': 'Brooks Cole', 'synopsis': '"This Solutions Manual supplements the textbook, General Chemistry, sixth edition, by Kenneth W. Whitten, Raymond E. Davis and M. Larry Peck. The solutions of the 1317 even-numbered problems at the end of the chapters have been worked out in a detailed, step-by-step fashion...The problems at the end of the chapters are a review, a practice and, in some cases, a challenge to your scientific problem-solving abilities. It is the fundamental spirit of this Solution Manual to help you to understand the scientific deductive process involved in each problem. In this manual, we provide you with a solution and an answer to the numerical problems, but our emphasis lies on providing the step-by-step reasoning behind the mathematical manipulatioins. In some cases, we present as many as three different approaches to solve the same problem, since we understand that each of you has your own unique learning style. In stoichiometry as well as in many other types of calculations, the \'unit factor\' method is universally emphasized in general chemistry textbooks. We think that the over-emphasis of this method may train you to regard chemistry problems as being simply mathematical manipulations in which the only objective is to cancel units and get the answer. Our goal is for you to understand the principles behind the calculations and hopefully to visualize with your mind\'s eye the chemical processes and the experimental techniques occurring as the problem is being worked out on paper. And so we have dissected the \'unit factor\' method for you and introduced chemial meaning into each of the steps."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/38/9780030212338.jpg', 'title_long': 'General Chemistry Student Solution Manual', 'edition': '6', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.9 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 4.90308070688 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 4.90308070688}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.9}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '1999-08-19', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Chemistry', 'General & Reference', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['WHITTEN'], 'title': 'General Chemistry Student Solution Manual', 'isbn13': '9780030212338', 'msrp': 84.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0030212332', 'isbn10': '0030212332'}}
