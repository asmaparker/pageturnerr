{'book': {'publisher': 'Organization for Economic', 'synopsis': 'The 1996 edition of "World Energy Outlook" adds to the IEA\'s ongoing analysis of global energy markets to the year 2010. In this year\'s "Outlook," changes in the background of the global energy market have led to changes in some key assumptions. As in the 1995 edition, two alternative cases are examined: one which sees capacity constraints arising early next century that will put upward pressure on energy prices, and a second which examines the potential for energy saving to reduce the growth rate of energy demand. In both cases, world energy demand will grow over the next 15 years, but not as quickly as the rate of economic growth. This edition also includes a study of the global iron and steel industry, in-depth regional analysis of the longer-term energy prospects in the countries of the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and OECD Europe, as well as an examination of the investment requirements of the power generation industry. The regional studies complete the IEA\'s analytical tour of the world which commenced in the 1994 edition and continued in the 1995 edition.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/61/9789264148161.jpg', 'title_long': 'World Energy Outlook, 1996', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 310, 'date_published': '1996', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics'], 'authors': ['Iea'], 'title': 'World Energy Outlook, 1996', 'isbn13': '9789264148161', 'msrp': 86, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9264148167', 'isbn10': '9264148167'}}
