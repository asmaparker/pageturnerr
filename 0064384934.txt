Architecture is examined as a cultural phenomenon as well as an artistic and technological achievement. The book is divided into two parts: Part One, \x93The Elements of Architecture,” deals with the basic properties of architecture in chapters that explain function, structural principles, and elements of design, including examples in the text and illustrations from all periods and styles. Part Two, \x93The History and Meaning of Architecture,” is a chronological survey of Western architectural development from prehistoric times to the present. The approach is selective in terms of buildings and architects included; the examples are chosen for their importance and significance and are fully explained. Each chronological chapter begins with a concise, historical outline giving the social and cultural background. The illustrations (photographs, drawings, maps, and plans) are integrated with the text and there are notes, suggested readings, a glossary, chronological chart, and index.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/33/9780064384933.jpg', 'title_long': 'Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, And Meaning', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.51 Inches, Length: 0.63 Inches, Width: 5.53 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.63}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.53}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.51}}, 'pages': 576, 'date_published': '1993-05-04', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Architecture', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Reference', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Leland Roth'], 'title': 'Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, And Meaning', 'isbn13': '9780064384933', 'msrp': 50, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0064384934', 'isbn10': '0064384934'}}
