Uninterested in marriage, his driving passion is to paint the fabled gardens of Lord Tregonning's Hellebore Hall -- an opportunity that is now at hand...if Gerrard agrees to create an honest portrait of Tregonning's daughter as well.<br/>Gerrard chafes at wasting his talents on some simpering miss, only to discover that Jacqueline Tregonning stirs him as no other. Certainly, she is beautiful, but it is her passionate nature that strikes sparks with Gerrard's own, igniting desire and sweeping them into each other's arms, convincing Gerrard that he has found his ideal soul mate -- the lady he must have as his wife.<br/>But something is horribly wrong at Hellebore Hall. Evil and lies are reaching out to ensnare Jacqueline -- and Gerrard will have to move Heaven and Earth to protect the remarkable woman who, for him, personifies the truth about love...", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/69/9780060505769.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Truth About Love (Cynster Novels, 12)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2006-01-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'British & Irish', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Stephanie Laurens'], 'title': 'The Truth About Love (Cynster Novels, 12)', 'isbn13': '9780060505769', 'msrp': 7.5, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061754838'}, 'isbn': '0060505761', 'isbn10': '0060505761', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061754838', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
