{'book': {'publisher': 'Oxford University Press', 'synopsis': "Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister of Malaysia since 1981, is one of Asia's most successful politicians. Once feared by some as an ideologue of state intervention to restructure Malaysian society, Mahathir is now admired by many for his vision of industrializing his nation into Asia's 'fifth tiger.'<br/>Paradoxes of Mahathirism is the first full-length scholarly examination of the enigma of Mahathir. As a study of political ideology, it explores Mahathir's ideas on nationalism, capitalism, Islam, populism, and authoritarianism--the core of Mahathirism. Within the context of Malaysia's recent political history, it charts the evolution of Mahathir's complex world-view to reveal paradoxes, alternating patterns of consistency and contradiction, which help us understand his politics, policies, and personality.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/43/9789676530943.jpg', 'title_long': 'Paradoxes of Mahathirism: An Intellectual Biography of Mahathir Mohamad', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 408, 'date_published': '2003-08-07', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political', 'Presidents & Heads of State', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Khoo Boo Teik'], 'title': 'Paradoxes of Mahathirism: An Intellectual Biography of Mahathir Mohamad', 'isbn13': '9789676530943', 'msrp': 9.85, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9676530948', 'isbn10': '9676530948'}}
