{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "For as long as she can remember, Lady Adriana Sutton has adored Colton Wyndham, to whom she has been promised by an agreement of courtship and betrothal since childhood. As a young girl, she was wounded by Colton's stubborn refusal to comply with his father's wishes and by his angry departure. He was too proud and too stubborn to accept a future not of his own choosing. Rather than submit, he fled from his ancestral home for a life of adventure and danger as an officer in the British army.<br/>The years have been immensely kind to Lady Adriana. No longer the plain, thin tomboy Colton had spurned, she has blossomed into an uncommon beauty desired by nearly every eligible bachelor in the land. Yet the only man she desires is the decorated hero who has finally come home to claim his rightful title. Arrogant, unmoved, and seductive as ever, he remains averse to the idea of their betrothal in spite of his growing desire for her.<br/>To demonstrate his belief that love cannot be forced, Colton agrees to court Lady Adriana for ninety days, after which time he will be allowed to keep his precious freedom if he so wishes. But much has changed since he balked at his father's plans. Forced into a courtship with this stunning, spirited woman, who is as different today from the young chit he left behind as spring is to winter, the heroic heart that was once closed to Adriana is moved by her charm, her grace, and her sensuality ... and begins to yield. But a secret from Colton's past may doom their burgeoning love ... even as the treacherous schemes of a sinister rival threaten to steal the remarkable lady from his arms forever.<br/>A lush and spellbinding story of passion and betrayal that grandly sweeps the reader into the magnificent ballrooms and intimate boudoirs of Regency England, The Reluctant Suitor is romance as only the incomparable Kathleen Woodiwiss can deliver it -- a love story that will dwell in the reader's heart and memory forever and stand proudly as one of the author's very best.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/33/9780061031533.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Reluctant Suitor', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.62611282408 Pounds, Width: 1.18 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.18}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.62611282408}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 592, 'date_published': '2007-09-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Romance', '20th Century', 'Regency', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Military'], 'authors': ['Kathleen E Woodiwiss'], 'title': 'The Reluctant Suitor', 'isbn13': '9780061031533', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061753750'}, 'isbn': '0061031534', 'isbn10': '0061031534', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061753756', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
