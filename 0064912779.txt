{'book': {'publisher': 'Barnes & Noble Imports', 'synopsis': "Aquinas (1224-74) lived at a time when the Christian West was opening up to a wealth of Greek and Islamic philosophical speculation. An embodiment of the thirteenth-century ideal of a unified interpretation of reality (in which philosophy and theology work together in harmony), Aquinas was remarkable for the way in which he used and developed this legacy of ancient thought - an achievement which led his contemporaries to regard him as an advanced thinker. Father Copleston's lucid and stimulating book examines this extraordinary man - whose influence is perhaps greater today than in his own lifetime - and his thought, relating his ideas wherever possible to problems as they are discussed today.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/78/9780064912778.jpg', 'title_long': 'Thomas Aquinas', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.05 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '1976', 'subjects': ['Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Frederick Charles Copleston'], 'title': 'Thomas Aquinas', 'isbn13': '9780064912778', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0064912779', 'isbn10': '0064912779'}}
