{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Never let it be said that a Cynster male can't face up to the one unassailable truth: A successful marriage gives life its fullest meaning. To all of English society, Simon Frederick Cynster has a perfect life -- one of enormous wealth and impeccable social status. His lean handsomeness turns the heads of na√Øve debutantes, while his sensual allure ensures he never lacks for more sophisticated partners for a night, or more, of pleasure. Yet despite all of this, Simon knows that there is something -- or rather someone -- missing in his life.<br/>To achieve true contentment, Simon must find a lady accomplished enough to be his wife, someone who will spend her days as a member of one of England's most influential families ... and her nights pursuing duties of a more private -- and personal -- nature.<br/>But Simon knows what to expect if he reveals his intention to choose a bride; nothing could be more tiresome than having every blushing miss on the marriage mart thrust upon him. So he discreetly begins his search at a house party at Glossup Hall ... and is astonished that the lady who immediately captures his interest is Portia Ashford.<br/>Simon has never considered Portia as a potential wife. He's known the raven-haired beauty since childhood; she's willfully independent and has always claimed to be uninterested in marriage. But an unexpectedly heated kiss abruptly alters the rules of their decade-long interaction. Soon they begin to long for the moments they can spend in each other's arms.<br/>But all is not as it seems at Glossup Hall. As Simon and Portia begin to explore the depths of their mutual passion, a shocking murder is committed ... and it appears that the next victim will be Portia herself. And even more shocking than the fact that a murderer secretly walks among them is the realization that all of Simon's considerable strength and influence may not be enough to protect Portia -- his once and always perfect lover ...", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/14/9780060505714.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Perfect Lover', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2003-02-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'World Literature', 'European', 'United States', 'Romance', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Stephanie Laurens'], 'title': 'The Perfect Lover', 'isbn13': '9780060505714', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060505710', 'isbn10': '0060505710'}}
