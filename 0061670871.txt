Truly modern women’s fiction at its finest, this is the unforgettable tale of a remarkable friendship that ended abruptly, only to be resurrected in great need years later at a college reunion, launching three formerly devoted companions and reluctant family members alike on a sobering, enlightening journey across the world and through the past. Brimming with the author’s trademark wit, vivid prose, and captivating characterizations, Falling Together brilliantly explores our deepest human connections and confirms Marisa de los Santos as one of America’s most exciting contemporary novelists.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/79/9780061670879.jpg', 'title_long': 'Falling Together: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2011-10-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Friendship', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Dysfunctional Families'], 'authors': ['Marisa de los Santos'], 'title': 'Falling Together: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780061670879', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061670871', 'isbn10': '0061670871'}}
