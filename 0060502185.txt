{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "From the moment she first saw tall, dashing Eric Ford, Camille's heart was lost. In her most cherished fantasy she is standing by his side, exchanging sacred wedding vows with her beloved. But Eric seems content to be no more than her unofficial protector, watching over the younger sister of his dear friend—and, despite her every attempt to open his eyes, it appears Camille's dream of wedded bliss might never come true.<br/>Eric knows a spirited and passionate beauty like Camille deserves much better than him, an ex-military man who has no patience for the games of the ton. Still, he aches each time a potential suitor approaches her, or when he sees her dancing in another man's arms. Eric knows he will never be complete until Camille is his. With each lingering glance and caressing touch he must tempt the lady to be his bride. But when danger and betrayal threaten, will it destroy a secret love…or bind two hearts for all eternity?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/88/9780060502188.jpg', 'title_long': 'To Tempt a Bride', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-10-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Edith Layton'], 'title': 'To Tempt a Bride', 'isbn13': '9780060502188', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061754277'}, 'isbn': '0060502185', 'isbn10': '0060502185', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061754272', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
