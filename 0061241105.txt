He destroyed her life.<br/>How difficult could killing him be?<br/>Madeline Piatro devoted four years of her life to her boyfriend Carlton—and, in return, got romance, flowers, and the best sex she'd ever had. But then he dumped her—by e-mail, no less! He used her, he broke her heart...and he even cost her the marketing job she dearly loved. Now Maddy's on a mission. She wants revenge and she wants her career back.<br/>But Maddy's about to discover that getting even, no matter how justifiable, isn't as easy as it might at first appear—even with a batch of arsenic brownies, the help of a professional (if bumbling) hit man, and the advice and best wishes of her very best friends.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/09/9780061241109.jpg', 'title_long': 'This Is How It Happened (not a love story)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2008-01-22', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Humorous', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Jo Barrett'], 'title': 'This Is How It Happened (not a love story)', 'isbn13': '9780061241109', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061842834'}, 'isbn': '0061241105', 'isbn10': '0061241105', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061842832', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
