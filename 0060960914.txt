They note the Oscar\'s origins, list nominees, both winners and losers, and recall classic Oscar moments (such as the 1974 streaker). The authors also examine various scandals, attempts to woo judges\' votes and efforts to engineer Oscar victories. A chapter considers the "Oscar Curse" on careers, and equal space is devoted to Oscar politics during the blacklist years. Brown and Pinkston also attack their least favorite honorees and offer an "Ultimate Oscar Quiz." Including 185 photos and many facts and figures, the book steers clear of the Hollywood Babylon approach, but the highly opinionated, campy writing rarely rises above chatty, fan-magazine style.<br/>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.<br/><br/>From Library Journal<br/><br/>Most of Oscar Dearest has been taken verbatim from Brown\'s The Real Oscar: the story behind the Academy Awards ( LJ 3/15/81), so this new book is virtually an updated edition. Here, the authors have added coverage for recent events concerning the Oscars, including a chapter giving an explanation for Steven Spielberg\'s failure to win an award. The book\'s new packaging cannot conceal the fact that, as with its progenitor, stylistic shortcomings and overzealous muckraking limit its appeal and value. John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.
