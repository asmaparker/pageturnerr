{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "On a stormy November night in 1848, a ship carrying more than a hundred Irish emigrants ran aground twenty miles off the coast of Maine. Many were saved, but some were not -- including a young girl who died crying out the name of her brother.<br/>In the present day, the artist Oisin MacDara lives in self-imposed exile on Tiranogue -- the small island where the shipwrecked Irish settled. The past is Oisin's curse, as memories of the twin sister who died tragically when he was a boy haunt him still.<br/>Then on a quiet All Hallows' Eve, a restless spirit is beckoned into his home by a candle flickering in the window: the ghost of the girl whose brief life ended on Tiranogue's shore more than a century earlier. In Oisin's house she seeks comfort and warmth, and a chance at the life that was denied her so long ago.<br/>For a lonely man chained by painful memories, nothing will ever be the same again.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/44/9780060937744.jpg', 'title_long': 'In the Country of the Young', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.79 Inches, Length: 8.01 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 5.36 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.01}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.36}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.79}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2002-03-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Magical Realism', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lisa Carey'], 'title': 'In the Country of the Young', 'isbn13': '9780060937744', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061895741'}, 'isbn': '0060937742', 'isbn10': '0060937742', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061895746', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
