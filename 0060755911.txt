{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'There\'s something going on in this Great Land of ours––more and more people are famous for being famous. Now, one of the Avon Trade program\'s brightest young voices examines what happens to an ordinary young woman who ends up in some pretty wild circumstances.<br/>When a Hollywood heartthrob moves in next door, Julie finds herself thrust into the spotlight and becomes a bona fide celebrity for no good reason at all! But the man known as "The Sexiest Man in Hollywood" is living in her somewhat shoddy building so he can "learn to live like the little people" while preparing for a new role. When Julie is caught by the paparazzi leaving his apartment, clad only in a bathrobe, the publicity machine takes over. Suddenly, Julie is the "new and normal" girlfriend. So fresh! She works as a waitress... So normal! She\'s a whopping size 10. Amazing, Julie and, by extension, her friends, even her mom, become famous simply for being, well, famous.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/11/9780060755911.jpg', 'title_long': 'My 15 Minutes', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2005-08-23', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Humorous', 'Romantic'], 'authors': ['Sara Faith Alterman'], 'title': 'My 15 Minutes', 'isbn13': '9780060755911', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006175000X'}, 'isbn': '0060755911', 'isbn10': '0060755911', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061750007', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
