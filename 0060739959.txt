A city of hope and hardship has caught the attention of the world -- and a maniacal killer has made it his hunting ground.<br/>Inspector Alastair Ransom carries the burden of the dead on his shoulders. But a demon far worse than Ransom's own is loose -- a bloodthirsty killer who preys on Chicago's most vulnerable citizens, his grisly handiwork masked by the glitter and frenzy of the World's Fair.
