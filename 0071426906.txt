{'book': {'publisher': 'McGraw-Hill Education', 'synopsis': 'An inspiring look at the heroism and heartbreak of the 1975 World Series In a year when the nation sorely needed a diversion from the harsh news of the day, it arrived in the form of a Fall Classic that would live up to its name and never be forgotten. The Boys of October takes the reader back to those 12 exhilarating days in 1975, when the field was guarded by greatness--Carl Yastrzemski, Carlton Fisk, Pete Rose, Johnny Bench--as the ragtag Boys from Beantown faced Cincinnati\'s "Big Red Machine." Their triumphs and tribulations are all here, from Fisk\'s historic winning homer in the wee hours of Game Six, to the series\' nail-biting finale, decided by a single, heart-stopping run. Through it all, the Boston Red Sox embodied the spirit of the game, in victory and defeat, to give us the series we needed-- and one we\'ll never forget. Against the backdrop of one turbulent summer, The Boys of October celebrates baseball and the heroes who made it what it is.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/09/9780071426909.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Boys of October', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Page Fidelity', 'pages': 282, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['General', 'Essays & Writings', 'SPO000000', 'cs.hlth.activ', 'cs.hlth.physc_ed', 'cs.kins.ftnss_wllns', 'cs.kins.hst_of_sprt', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Health -> Activities & Sports'], 'authors': ['Doug Hornig'], 'title': 'The Boys of October', 'isbn13': '9780071426909', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Kindle Edition', 'related': {'Hardcover': '0071402470'}, 'isbn': '0071426906', 'isbn10': '0071426906', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780071402477', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
