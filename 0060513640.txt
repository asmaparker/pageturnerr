{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Proper decorum has never come easily to Carlotta Anne Fairleigh—not even tonight, when the lovely, impetuous miss is finally making her debut. As she waits to make her entrance, she can\'t help wondering about the darkened house next door, the supposedly abandoned home of Hayden St. Clair, the man society has dubbed the "Murderous Marquess." Certainly one small peek through his window before the festivities would be harmless . . .<br/>And, naturally, this latest "adventure" ends in disaster, thoroughly compromising the budding debutante\'s reputation and leaving her suddenly, unthinkably . . . betrothed! Soon she\'s en route to the wilds of Cornwall in the company of the handsome, mysterious marquess whose name the ton whisper with fear and loathing.<br/>Yet there is something thrilling—and surprisingly tender—about her dark, unreachable groom, and the desire in his eyes is undeniable. But before Lottie will surrender to the yearnings in her heart, she must unlock the secrets of Hayden\'s past, no matter how scandalous—or perilous—they may be.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/41/9780060513641.jpg', 'title_long': 'One Night of Scandal (Fairleigh Sisters, 2)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.07 Inches, Length: 6.79 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 4.18 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.79}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.18}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.07}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-07-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Teresa Medeiros'], 'title': 'One Night of Scandal (Fairleigh Sisters, 2)', 'isbn13': '9780060513641', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061796026'}, 'isbn': '0060513640', 'isbn10': '0060513640', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061796029', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
