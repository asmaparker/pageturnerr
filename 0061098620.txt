Praised as "the direct heir to Patrick O\'Brian" (Agincourt, The Fort), Cornwell has brilliantly captured the fury, chaos, and excitement of battle as few writers have ever done—perhaps most vividly in his phenomenally popular novels following the illustrious military career of British Army officer Richard Sharpe during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Chronicling Sharpe\'s involvement in the famous Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, Sharpe\'s Trafalgar finds the young ensign captive on a French warship and in gravest peril on the eve of the one of the most spectacular naval confrontations in history. Perhaps the San Francisco Chronicle said it best: "If only all history lessons could be as vibrant."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/28/9780061098628.jpg', 'title_long': "Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, October 21, 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)", 'edition': 'Repack', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.720721 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.720721}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.56}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 293, 'date_published': '2012', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Sea Stories', 'War', 'Action & Adventure', 'Sea Adventures', 'War & Military', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Bernard Cornwell'], 'title': "Sharpe's Trafalgar: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Trafalgar, October 21, 1805 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)", 'isbn13': '9780061098628', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0061098620', 'isbn10': '0061098620', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061751738', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
