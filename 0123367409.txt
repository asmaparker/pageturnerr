{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Atmospheric Chemistry is a comprehensive treatment of atmospheric chemistry and covers topics ranging from the structure of the atmosphere to the chemistry of the upper atmosphere and the ionosphere. Atmospheric pollutants, hydrocarbon oxidation, and photochemical smog are also discussed, along with the reactions of O8 and singlet O2, the chemistry of SO2 and aerosols, and methods for controlling atmospheric pollution.<br/>This book is comprised of 10 chapters and begins with an overview of the composition and chemistry of the atmosphere as well as its physical characteristics and the chemistry of meteors. The next two chapters deal with the chemistry of the upper atmosphere and the ionosphere, with emphasis on neutral oxygen atmosphere, carbon-hydrogen-oxygen cycle, and the D region. The chemistry of atmospheric pollutants is also examined, along with hydrocarbon oxidation and photochemical smog. The remaining chapters focus on the reactions of O8 and singlet O2, the chemistry of SO2 and aerosols, and methods for controlling atmospheric pollution.<br/>This monograph should be useful to graduate students and scientists who wish to study atmospheric chemistry.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/02/9780123367402.jpg', 'title_long': 'Atmospheric chemistry', 'edition': 1, 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.9400679056 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.9400679056}}, 'pages': 406, 'date_published': '1976', 'subjects': ['Meteorology & Climatology', 'General', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Geology -> Mineralogy', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Physics -> General'], 'authors': ['Julian Heicklen'], 'title': 'Atmospheric chemistry', 'isbn13': '9780123367402', 'msrp': 72.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0123367409', 'isbn10': '0123367409', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780323151108', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
