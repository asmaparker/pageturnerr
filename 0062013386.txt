{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins e-books', 'synopsis': "Discovering the Body is a gripping novel filled with psychological suspense, sensitivity, and emotional complexity. With this stunning debut, Mary Howard has crafted an electrifying and hauntingly evocative novel of truth and perception, of the ties we tell others-and the lies we tell ourselves. Two years ago Linda Garbo left her graphic design job in Minneapolis to open a printmaking studio in a small town in Iowa with the encouragement of Luci Cole, a weaver and an old friend from art school. Arriving in Linden Grove for good, Linda agrees to stay with Luci and her boyfriend, Charlie, in their old farmhouse outside of town until the renovations to her new studio space are completed. But the following afternoon as she is driving down the long winding road toward Luci's house, Linda sees Luci's neighbor, Peter Garvey, walking out the front door-and when Linda enters the house a few minutes later, she discovers her friend's lifeless body on the kitchen floor. Now, two years later, Peter Garvey has been convicted of Luci's murder. Linda is married to Charlie and living in the very house where Luci died. And she is convinced someone is following her. As she begins to confront her fears-approaching the man she believes is spying on her, visiting Peter Garvey in prison-she finally faces the cause for her frequent panic attacks: she was too traumatized by her discovery of Luci's body to be a reliable witness. And if she's identified the wrong man, the killer may still be close by, ready to react if she admits she might have made a mistake. Compelled to unravel the mystery surrounding Luci's final days, Linda finds that Luci was a master at weaving her true colors into a complex tapestry, preferring involvements that required secrecy. A beautifully crafted tour de force of significant depth, passion, and power, Discovering the Body is a completely beguiling meditation on perception, loss, memory, and redemption whose conclusion proves to be as significantly haunting as it is satisfying.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/85/9780062013385.jpg', 'title_long': 'Discovering the Body: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'ePub', 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2010', 'subjects': ['Suspense', 'Literary', 'Psychological', 'Technological', 'Contemporary Women', 'Crime', 'General', 'English & College Success -> English -> Fiction'], 'authors': ['Mary Howard'], 'title': 'Discovering the Body: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780062013385', 'msrp': 10.4, 'binding': 'Kindle Edition', 'related': {'Paperback': '0060937173'}, 'isbn': '0062013386', 'isbn10': '0062013386', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780060937171', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
