Written as a series of free-verse poems from Jack\'s point of view, and with classic poetry included in the back matter, this novel is perfect for kids and teachers, too.<br/>Jack hates poetry. Only girls write it and every time he tries to, his brain feels empty. But his teacher, Miss Stretchberry, won\'t stop giving her class poetry assignmentsâ€”and Jack can\'t avoid them. But then something amazing happens. The more he writes, the more he learns that he does have something to say.<br/>"I guess it does<br/>look like a poem<br/>when you see it<br/>typed up<br/>like that."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/99/9780064409599.jpg', 'title_long': 'Love That Dog', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.62 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.32 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.32}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.62}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2001-03-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Sharon Creech'], 'title': 'Love That Dog', 'isbn13': '9780064409599', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061961337', 'ePub': '0061961337'}, 'isbn': '0064409597', 'isbn10': '0064409597', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061961335', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
