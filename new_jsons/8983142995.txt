Only by knowing the gospel of the water and the Spirit, the real substance of the Tabernacle, can we correctly understand and know the answer to this question. In fact, the blue, purple, and scarlet thread and the fine woven linen manifested in the gate of the Tabernacle`s court show us the works of Jesus Christ in the New Testament`s time that have saved the mankind. In this way, the Old Testament`s Word of the Tabernacle and the Word of the New Testament are closely and definitely related to each other, like fine woven linen. But, unfortunately, this truth has been hidden for a long time to every truth seeker in Christianity. Coming to this earth, Jesus Christ was baptized by John and shed His blood on the Cross. Without understanding and believing in the gospel of the water and the Spirit, none of us can ever find out the truth revealed in the Tabernacle. We must now learn this truth of the Tabernacle and believe in it. We all need to realize and believe in the truth manifested in the blue, purple, and scarlet thread and the fine woven linen of the gate of the Tabernacle`s court.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/93/9788983142993.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Tabernacle: A Detailed Portrait of Jesus Christ I', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.25 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.25}}, 'pages': 369, 'date_published': '2003-02-15', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['Paul C.
