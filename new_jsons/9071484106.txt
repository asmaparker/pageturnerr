{'book': {'publisher': 'Share Intl USA', 'synopsis': 'Humanity is guided from behind the scenes by a highly evolved and illumined group of men Who have preceded us along the path of evolution. These Masters of Wisdom, as They are called, seldom appear openly, but usually work through Their disciples - men and women who influence society through their work in science, education, art, religion, politics, and in every department of life. British artist Benjamin Creme is a disciple of a Master with Whom he is in close telepathic contact. Since the launching of Share International, the magazine of which Benjamin Creme is editor, his Master has contributed to every issue an inspiring article on a wide range of subjects: reason and intuition; the new civilization; health and healing; the art of living; the need for synthesis; justice is divine; the Son of Man; human rights; the law of rebirth; the end of hunger; sharing for peace; the rise of people power; the brightest future; co-operation - and many more. The major purpose of these articles is to draw attention to the needs of the present and the immediate future time, and to give information about the teachings of Maitreya, the Master of all the Masters. This third edition contains all 223 articles from the first 22 volumes of Share International.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/00/9789071484100.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Master Speaks', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 0.75 Inches, Width: 5.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '1993-12-31', 'subjects': ['Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Benjamin Creme'], 'title': 'A Master Speaks', 'isbn13': '9789071484100', 'msrp': 11, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9071484106', 'isbn10': '9071484106'}}
