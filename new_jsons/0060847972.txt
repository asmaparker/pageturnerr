{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Henry's got it good. He's a semi-successful, if not yet famous novelist. He's got a good job and good buds. Best of all, he's got Layla, his long-time, live-in lover, a fast-track associate at a New Jersey law firm. Henry loves Layla and she loves him. Life is a banquet, until . . . The Ultimatum!<br/>In a week, Henry and Layla are off to Maine for a friend's wedding. And if Henry hasn't proposed marriage by the time the bride tosses the bouquet, Layla swears they're finished. For good. Henry thinks if it's not broke, don't fix it. But Layla needs proof of his love and devotion. And she's not kidding.<br/>So who can he turn to for advice? Jake, his despondent divorced brother? His marriage-junkie golf friend, Big John? His outsized Peter Pan pal Pete, who simply won't grow up? Meanwhile Layla's got her two best girlfriends, tough-talking Gloria and sensitive Susan, giving helpful, contradictory advice.<br/>Time is ticking away on the most important decision of Henry's life. But it'll take a mad, high-speed road trip and some bizarre behavior—perhaps even an impromptu kidnapping—to point him in the right, life-changing direction.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/75/9780060847975.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Ultimatum', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044933474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 291, 'date_published': '2007-07-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Psychological', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Dan Graziano'], 'title': 'The Ultimatum', 'isbn13': '9780060847975', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061754943'}, 'isbn': '0060847972', 'isbn10': '0060847972', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061754944', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
