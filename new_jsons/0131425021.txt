Read it and learn!"<br/>Drea Zigarmi Author of The Leader Inside: Learning Enough About Yourself To Lead Others and co-author of Leadership and the One Minute Manager<br/>"We like to say, \'See it with your mind\'s eye.\' Wind and Crook show us that our mind is our eye. What we think is what we see, and what we see directs how we act. Not only do the authors make this paradigm clear, but they offer concrete and practical ways to change our mind\'s eye and as a consequence change our actions and the results we get. The value of that is hard to top."<br/>J. Stewart Black, Ph.D. co-author of Leading Strategic Change and Professor, University of Michigan Business School<br/>"I have been trying to explain why Japan has fallen into a pitfall and cannot come out of even the simplest problems. One can call it an innovators dilemma, but that does not solve the problem. This book suggests we have to go back to the basics of reviewing our underlying \'mental models\' now and then, and only then, have to construct a new model, perhaps plural, and move onto exploring the new terrain."<br/>Kenichi Ohmae Author of the international bestseller, The Borderless World<br/>"While most of us may recognize that the world we respond to is more in our mind than in any physical reality, often we don\'t have a clue why this is so. This very important book clearly explains how our mental models work to construct these distinct inner worlds. And more importantly it offers empowering advice on how we can use this knowledge to work for us rather than against us in creating a better outer world for ourselves, our organizations, and our societies."<br/>Charles C. Manz Best-selling author of SuperLeadership, Fit to Lead, and Temporary Sanity<br/>"This is an important book that \'makes sense of how we make sense.\' The authors provide a thorough, fresh, and compelling exploration into the dimensions of mental models. All leaders who want to be more effective in their actions would be served well to leverage the principles in this book to learn about how they think and make sense of the world around them."<br/>Nick Pudar Director of Strategic Initiatives, General Motors', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/26/9780131425026.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Power Of Impossible Thinking: Transform The Business Of Your Life & The Life Of Your Business', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.35363828868 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35363828868}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 274, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Management'], 'authors': ['Yoram (Jerry) Wind', 'Colin Crook', 'Robert Gunther'], 'title': 'The Power Of Impossible Thinking: Transform The Business Of Your Life & The Life Of Your Business', 'isbn13': '9780131425026', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0131425021', 'isbn10': '0131425021'}}
