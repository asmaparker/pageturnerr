{'book': {'publisher': 'Potomac Books', 'synopsis': "Confederate Raider is the enthralling story of the Civil War as fought on the high seas by Raphael Semmes, the Confederacy's most famous and revered naval officer. Yet many of his Northern contemporaries considered the Yankee-hating Semmes nothing more than a pirate. In either guise, Semmes commanded the most successful sea raider of all time - the C.S.S. Alabama. During a two-year cruise, she took nearly a hundred Federal merchant vessels out of the war and became a household word on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line. Her final battle, off the coast of France against the U.S.S. Kearsarge, was an epic clash befitting the last one-on-one duel of wooden ships. A commander who carried out his mission without being able to bring his ship into a Southern port and whose crew had no allegiance to the Confederacy, Semmes is a brilliant and compelling figure in American military history.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/67/9780028810867.jpg', 'title_long': 'Confederate Raider: Raphael Semmes of the Alabama', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.44182319348 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.44182319348}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '1994', 'subjects': ['History', 'Military', 'Naval'], 'authors': ['John M.
