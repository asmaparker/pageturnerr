{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'This volume surveys the chemistry and heterocyclic syntheses of aminomethylenemalonates and their cyclic sters. Early reviews in this field merely touched on certain aspects of the related chemistry. This is the first in-depth systematic treatment of the subject. The material is of particular importance in medicinal chemistry as derivatives of aminomethylene malonates are key intermediates in the synthesis of antimalarial agents. The literature reviewed has led to the discovery of nalidixic acid and its derivatives, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, as well as the new quinolones that are active against AIDS-related Legionella spp.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/41/9780120207541.jpg', 'title_long': 'Aminomethylenemalonates and Their Use in Heterocyclic Synthesis (Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, Volume 54)', 'edition': 2, 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.77913045434 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.77913045434}}, 'pages': 451, 'date_published': '1992-09-23', 'subjects': ['Organic', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Chemistry -> Organic Chemistry'], 'authors': ['Istvan Hermecz', 'Geza Kereszturi', 'Lelle Vasvari-Debreczy'], 'title': 'Aminomethylenemalonates and Their Use in Heterocyclic Synthesis (Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, Volume 54)', 'isbn13': '9780120207541', 'msrp': 72.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0120207540', 'isbn10': '0120207540', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780080576411', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
