{'book': {'publisher': 'Armour Publishing Pte Ltd', 'synopsis': 'This is an honest biography of an extraordinary man. No attempt is made either to conceal or to camourflage the idiosyncrasies and spiritual defects in John Sung\'s personality. At first sight it is almost surprising that God should have been pleased to prosper his ministry so greatly. He had a strong will and a hot temper. He was independent to the point of being sometimes stubborn. A rebel as a boy, he remined an individualist all his life. He could be abrupt and even rude. His wife and family must at times have felt neglected. He was certainly a scholar, with remarkable academic attainments, but his Biblical preaching was never "scholarly" and could be grotesque. Is there any explanation of John Sung\'s great power? Why did God bring salvation to so many sinners, fullness of life to so many believers and revival to so many churches through his comparatively brief ministry of only 15 years (1929 - 1944)? Can we learn from his experience what are the conditions of divine blessing? This book will make every reader ask, "Why did God honour the ministry of John Sung?" It will lead the reader to ponder carefully the qualities of the worker whom God blesses and the character of the work that He prospers. And it will show the relevance that John Sung\'s story still has for us in 21st Century Asia.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/92/9789814138192.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Biography of John Sung', 'dimensions': 'weight: 340 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 340}}, 'pages': 312, 'date_published': '2004-01-01', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['Leslie T.
