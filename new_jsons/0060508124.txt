{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "It is whispered behind the fans of London's dowagers and in the corners of fashionable ballrooms that scandal follows willfully wild Lady Beatrix Lennox wherever she goes.<br/>Three years before, the debutante created a sensation by being found in a distinctly compromising position. Now, the ton has branded her as unmarriageable, her family has called her a vixen, and Beatrix sees no reason not to go after what -- and who -- she wishes.<br/>And she wants Stephen Fairfax-Lacy, the handsome Earl of Spade. Beatrix, with her brazen suggestions and irresistibly sensuous allure, couldn't be more different from the earl's ideal future bride. Yet Beatrix brings out a wildness in the earl he has tried to deny far too long. Still, he's not about to play love's game by Lady Beatrix's rules. She may be used to being on top in affairs of the heart, but that will soon change.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/28/9780060508128.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Wild Pursuit (Duchess in Love, 3)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2004-02-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Eloisa James'], 'title': 'A Wild Pursuit (Duchess in Love, 3)', 'isbn13': '9780060508128', 'msrp': 4.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '006180195X', 'ePub': '006180195X'}, 'isbn': '0060508124', 'isbn10': '0060508124', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061801952', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
