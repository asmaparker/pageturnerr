While Jane's planning the wedding of her dreams—with no overbearing mother-in-law to steamroll the entire event and tell her what to wear—Mel convinces her and her best friend Shelley to take a women's self-defense class. But before Jane and Shelley can learn the karate kicks and mean moves to fight off even the perfect purse-snatcher, their class is cut brutally short . . . when two participants are murdered.<br/>Between her new writing project, an addition to the house, and battling mothers-in-law, she's got her hands full. But she'll have to make time to help Mel find the killer if she wants to walk happily—and safely—down the aisle.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/61/9780060528461.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Accidental Florist (Jane Jeffry Mysteries)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.24912235606 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.24912235606}}, 'pages': 219, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths'], 'authors': ['Jill Churchill'], 'title': 'The Accidental Florist (Jane Jeffry Mysteries)', 'isbn13': '9780060528461', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '006052846X', 'isbn10': '006052846X'}}
