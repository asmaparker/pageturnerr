{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "His name has become a synonym for clairvoyance: Nostradamus, astrologer to the king of France, the most famous seer in Western history. But the real meaning of his prophecies has gone undetected, hidden in a secret alchemical code. Known as the Green Language, it was understood by only a handful of medieval occult scholars, and has been lost for centuries -- until now.<br/>David Ovason spent 40 years working on the Green Language, enabling him to finally crack the secret code of Nostradamus. In this book, he reveals with line-by-line analysis the hidden writings of the great astrologer, showing that his dates and details are more exact than any previous scholars have realized. As a master of the arcane astrological traditions practiced by Nostradamus, Ovason provides the most accurate and insightful account ever written of this mysterious figure's writings, predictions, and life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/94/9780060084394.jpg', 'title_long': "The Secrets of Nostradamus: A Radical New Interpretation of the Master's Prophecies", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.895 Pounds, Width: 1.11712 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.11712}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.895}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2002-08-06', 'subjects': ['History', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Astrology', 'Occult & Paranormal', 'Occultism'], 'authors': ['David Ovason'], 'title': "The Secrets of Nostradamus: A Radical New Interpretation of the Master's Prophecies", 'isbn13': '9780060084394', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0062194011'}, 'isbn': '0060084391', 'isbn10': '0060084391', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062194015', 'binding': 'ebook'}]}}
