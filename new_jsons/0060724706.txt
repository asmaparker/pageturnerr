{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "It starts when Cal gets off the train at the wrong stop in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. He's stranded.<br/>Following a muddy path leads him to a castle that appears to be deserted. But inside is Corbenic, a magnificent hotel filled with rich people preparing for a banquet—and Cal is their guest of honor. During the meal, he experiences a disturbing vision, but when he is asked to talk about what he has seen, he denies it. What if he's becoming crazy, like his mother?<br/>When Cal wakes the next morning, the elegant castle turns out to be nothing more than an abandoned ruin. But something inside him has changed—he now knows he needs to right the wrongs in his life. It will be a difficult journey, and if Cal achieves his goal, it will not be without cost. The first step—he must return to Corbenic.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/02/9780060724702.jpg', 'title_long': 'Corbenic', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.84 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.84}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2006-09-05', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Catherine Fisher'], 'title': 'Corbenic', 'isbn13': '9780060724702', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060724706', 'isbn10': '0060724706', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062193759', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
