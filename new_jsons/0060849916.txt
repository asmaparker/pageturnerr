What no one knows is that Irina herself is half–vampire. Determined to deny that side of her, Irina captures Bishop, believing he can lead her to the vampire responsible for her mother's death. But over the course of Bishop's captivity, secrets about Irina's past are revealed and she soon learns that what she has always believed to be true is anything but. Now Irina and Bishop are in a race against time as they fight for their lives––and their love.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/17/9780060849917.jpg', 'title_long': 'Night of the Huntress (Brotherhood of Blood)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.39903669422 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.39903669422}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2007-01-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Historical', 'Vampires', 'Action & Adventure', 'Werewolves & Shifters', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Romantic'], 'authors': ['Kathryn Smith'], 'title': 'Night of the Huntress (Brotherhood of Blood)', 'isbn13': '9780060849917', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061750824'}, 'isbn': '0060849916', 'isbn10': '0060849916', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061750823', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
