They've been inseparable since second grade, when fate tossed them together with a little help from a bad haircut, green boxer shorts, flying rice cakes, and a couple of hard-earned nicknames. So when an accident threatens to tear them apart, Guy finds himself clinging to precious memories of the friendship he'd wished for all his life.<br/>The ups and downs and inevitable complications of friendship have never been more funny, poignant, and sweet than in this fourth installment of the Guy series.<br/>Wishes can come true, but sometimes the things we wish for arrive in the most unlikely of packages.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/22/9780060294922.jpg', 'title_long': 'Guy Wire (Guy Series)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 138, 'date_published': '2002-10-15', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Sarah Weeks'], 'title': 'Guy Wire (Guy Series)', 'isbn13': '9780060294922', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060294922', 'isbn10': '0060294922'}}
