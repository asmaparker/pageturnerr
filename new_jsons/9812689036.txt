Each chapter is color-coded for easy reference, and features everything you’ll need to know about the sights and attractions in the area as well as maps to help you get around and carefully chosen listings of the best places to sleep, eat, drink and get active. The Places section is interspersed with fully mapped tours, suggesting a great route such as a walk through the old Thai capital of Ayutthaya; and Cultural Spreads that give a striking insight into an element of Thailand’s culinary, artistic, sporting or popular culture, from Buddhism to elephants to lady-boys.<br/><br/>Further practical advice is provided in a chapter dedicated to accommodations, transportation, health and safety, money and budgeting, responsible travel, and family holidays. The Setting the Scene chapter is devoted to Thailand’s historical and cultural background, plus information on the country’s cuisine.<br/>Finally, a handy 8-page Phrasebook section provides a wealth of language expertise for which the Berlitz brand is famous.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/30/9789812689030.jpg', 'title_long': 'Berlitz Thailand: Handbook (Berlitz Handbooks)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.62 Inches, Length: 5.19 Inches, Weight: 1.19 Pounds, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.19}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.62}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2011-09-01', 'subjects': ['Travel', 'Asia', 'Thailand', 'Southeast'], 'authors': ['Howard Richardson'], 'title': 'Berlitz Thailand: Handbook (Berlitz Handbooks)', 'isbn13': '9789812689030', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9812689036', 'isbn10': '9812689036'}}
