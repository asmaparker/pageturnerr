{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'A daughter of privilege in the most powerful empire the world has ever known, Claudia has a unique and disturbing "gift": her dreams have an uncanny way of coming true. As a rebellious child seated beside the tyrannical Roman Emperor Tiberius, she first spies the powerful gladiator who will ultimately be her one true passion. Yet it is the ambitious magistrate Pontius Pilate who intrigues the impressionable young woman she becomes, and Claudia finds her way into his arms by means of a mysterious ancient magic. Pilate is her grand destiny, leading her to Judaea and plunging her into a seething cauldron of open rebellion. But following her friend Miriam of Magdala\'s confession of her ecstatic love for a charismatic religious radical, Claudia begins to experience terrifying visionsâ€”horrific premonitions of war, injustice, untold devastation and damnation . . . and the crucifixion of a divine martyr whom she must do everything in her power to save.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/53/9780061128653.jpg', 'title_long': "Pilate's Wife: A Novel of the Roman Empire", 'edition': 'First Edition / First Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 1.21 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.21}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2006-10-24', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Biblical', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Alternate History'], 'authors': ['Antoinette May'], 'title': "Pilate's Wife: A Novel of the Roman Empire", 'isbn13': '9780061128653', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061128651', 'isbn10': '0061128651'}}
