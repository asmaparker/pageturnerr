{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Cell Surface Proteases provides a comprehensive overview of these important enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a protein as it degrades to a simpler substance. In the 1990s, an explosion of new discoveries shed light on the role of cell surface proteases and extended it beyond degradation of extracellular matrix components to include its influence on growth factors, cell signaling, and other cellular events. This volume unites the scientific literature from across disciplines and teases out unified themes of interactions between cell surface proteases and interconnecting cell surface-related systems -- including integrins and other adhesion molecules. Scientists and students involved in developmental biology, cell biology and disease processes will find this an indispensable resource.<br/><br/>* Provides an overview of the entire field of cell surface proteases in a single volume* Presents major issues and astonishing discoveries at the forefront of modern developmental biology and developmental medicine * A thematic volume in the longest-running forum for contemporary issues in developmental biology with over 30 years of coverage', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/46/9780121531546.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cell Surface Proteases (Volume 54) (Current Topics in Developmental Biology, Volume 54)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.7196056436 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.7196056436}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 452, 'date_published': '2003-04-16', 'subjects': ['Developmental Biology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Cell Biology', 'Genetics & Genomics', 'Botany', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Botany', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Genetics', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Developmental Biology', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Molecular & Cell Biology'], 'authors': ['Stanley Zucker'], 'title': 'Cell Surface Proteases (Volume 54) (Current Topics in Developmental Biology, Volume 54)', 'isbn13': '9780121531546', 'msrp': 219.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0121531546', 'isbn10': '0121531546', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780080490885', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
