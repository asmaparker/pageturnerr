{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall College Div', 'synopsis': 'Key Helping prospective and practicing teachers become critically informed about the process of teaching and schooling in America, this book is designed to actively engage them in the process of developing a personal perspective of the function of schooling in our society - and of their special responsibilities as future teachers, to consider the broader implications of the enterprise of formal education in this country. Key Offering original source materials written by authors representing divergent points of views and a broad historical spectrum in the field of education, it examines the roots of our system of public schooling, the assumptions upon which it rests, and the degree to which it serves all children equitably and effectively. It concludes each part with a series of open-ended questions that provide a preview of some of the major ideas explored in the readings, and stimulate them to explore the implications of the readings as they discuss their thoughts and feelings. Suggestions for field and practicum experiences are included at the end of the book, encouraging users to actively participate in different school and community-based projects and go beyond the pedagogical dimensions of classroom teaching.
