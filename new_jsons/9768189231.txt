{'book': {'publisher': 'Arawak Publications', 'synopsis': "A seminal work covering the period from the 1920s (when early radio stations of the USA were first received in Jamaica) through to 1939 when the first programmes from Jamaica's ZQI were transmitted, to watershed periods in local radio (particularly the major strikes at JBC in 1964 and 1981). The book ends in 1997 when the JBC was officially closed. Rewind is the first known collection of the historical highlights not only of Jamaica's two leading mainstream radio stations, but also of the later additions to the growing family of such stations, and the supporting agencies that represent advertising and education, namely the local advertising agencies, the Educational Broadcasting Service (EBS) and the UWI's Radio Education Unit (REU). The author has assembled significant data on each entity into an entrancing popular history account coloured by her own experiences from half-a-century of work in local radio. The book, designed primarily for use in the communication courses of the island's universities is, nonetheless, written in a style that makes it interesting and accessible to readers without student motivation. Photographs enrich the text which comprises 18 chapters, with appendix, tables, figures, bibliography and index.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/33/9789768189233.jpg', 'title_long': 'Rewind: My Recollections of Radio and Broadcasting in Jamaica', 'dimensions': 'weight: 567 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 567}}, 'pages': 394, 'date_published': '2002-05-01', 'subjects': ['Radio Broadcasting', 'History'], 'authors': ['Alma MockYen'], 'title': 'Rewind: My Recollections of Radio and Broadcasting in Jamaica', 'isbn13': '9789768189233', 'msrp': 36, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9768189231', 'isbn10': '9768189231'}}
