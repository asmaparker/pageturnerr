{'book': {'publisher': 'John Benjamins Publishing Company', 'synopsis': "Although it is widely thought that structural linguistics began abruptly with the publication of Saussure's 'revolutionary' Course in General Linguistics, the work of E. F. K. Koerner has demonstrated that Saussure, for all his originality, remained true to the basic tenets of his 19th-century predecessors. In this volume, the development of modern linguistics before, during and after Saussure is traced in 20 studies honouring the scholar who has done more than anyone else to professionalize linguistic historiography during the last quarter century. Among the wide range of topics covered are: grammar and philosophy in the age of comparativism, the relation of Saussure's anagram studies to his theory of the linguistic sign, nationalist overtones in German linguistics from 1914 to 1945, and the true story (with newly discovered documentation) of why Chomsky's Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory didn't get published during the 1950s or 60s. In addition to an introductory overview of Koerner's career and a complete listing of his publications, the volume includes previously unpublished materials from Saussure's notebooks.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/72/9789027221872.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Emergence of the Modern Language Sciences: Studies on the transition from historical-comparative to structural linguistics in honour of E.F.K.
