{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Bestselling author Harriet Lerner focuses on the challenge and the importance of being able to express one\'s "authentic voice" in intimate relationships. The key problem in relationships, particularly over time, is that people begin to lose their voice. Despite decades of assertiveness training and lots of good advice about communicating with clarity, timing, and tact, women and men find that their greatest complaints in marriage and other intimate relationships are that they are not being heard, that they cannot affect the other person, that fights go nowhere, that conflict brings only pain. Although an intimate, long-term relationship offers the greatest possibilities for knowing the other person and being known, these relationships are also fertile ground for silence and frustration when it comes to articulating a true self. And yet giving voice to this self is at the center of having both a relationship and a self. Much as she did in THE MOTHER DANCE, Lerner will approach this rich subject with tales from her personal life and clinical work, inspiring and teaching readers to speak their own truths to the most important people in their lives.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/65/9780060956165.jpg', 'title_long': "The Dance of Connection: How to Talk to Someone When You're Mad, Hurt, Scared, Frustrated, Insulted, Betrayed, or Desperate", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.61}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.43}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2002-08-06', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Conflict Management', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Emotions', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Conflict Resolution', 'Parenting', 'Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Speech'], 'authors': ['Harriet Lerner'], 'title': "The Dance of Connection: How to Talk to Someone When You're Mad, Hurt, Scared, Frustrated, Insulted, Betrayed, or Desperate", 'isbn13': '9780060956165', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061851833'}, 'isbn': '006095616X', 'isbn10': '006095616X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061851834', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
