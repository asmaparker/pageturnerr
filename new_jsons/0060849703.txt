{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "As a young psychic, Regina Milbourne became the unlikely and reluctant confidante to the denizens of Miami's seedy underworld. Murderers, thieves, crooked cops, pedophiles, cheating spouses, and Russian drug dealers all came to Regina, who charged (and ultimately paid) a premium to shield them from dangerous evil forces. Even when confronted with death, corruption, and life-threatening encounters, Regina stood by her promise to help anyone who sought her guidance.<br/>But when her and her family's lives were threatened, she decided to turn her back on the gift she's had since almost drowning at the age of twelve. In Miami Psychic, she comes clean, divulging -- without revealing the identity of any of her clients -- the unimaginable horrors and shocking confessions that she witnessed throughout her career.<br/>Part gypsy priestess and part psychologist, Regina has experienced it all -- from a narcotics officer smuggling drugs to an identity thief plagued by a deceased brother and a Miami heiress cursed by black magic. This harrowing memoir reveals her story in a voice as raw and haunting as the world she came to know and ultimately left behind.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/02/9780060849702.jpg', 'title_long': 'Miami Psychic: Confessions of a Confidante', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2006-05-30', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Divination', 'Occult & Paranormal', 'Parapsychology'], 'authors': ['Regina Milbourne', 'Yvonne Carey'], 'title': 'Miami Psychic: Confessions of a Confidante', 'isbn13': '9780060849702', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061747742'}, 'isbn': '0060849703', 'isbn10': '0060849703', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061747748', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
