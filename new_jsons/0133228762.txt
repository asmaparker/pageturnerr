{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': 'Fluid Mechanics, Fourth Edition, incorporates many significant changes from earlier editions, while still retaining its emphasis on fundamental concepts and physical principles. These changes are directed to making the text more user-friendly to both the student and the instructor. The learning goals at the beginning of each chapter have been rewritten to be action-oriented, providing the student with self-evaluation guides. A new, unified method of problem solving has been adopted and is used in the solution of all illustrative problems in the text. Calculus supplements are included for enrichment and enhancement of the presentation. The total number of problems has been increased by approximately 60%, and they are segregated by topic and difficulty. Since spreadsheets are being widely used to solve engineering problems, solutions to some illustrative problems are given using the Excel spreadsheet. This is in addition to the use of BASIC programming to solve these problems. The sections on buoyancy, viscosity, pipe flow, and flow losses have been expanded and clarified. In addition, the end-of-chapter reviews with the listing of key words and important equations have all been revised and retained. These additional features are valuable in making this text a useful learning tool for the student.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/62/9780133228762.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fluid Mechanics for Engineering Technology', 'edition': 'Subsequent', 'dimensions': 'weight: 862 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 862}}, 'pages': 402, 'date_published': '1989', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Civil & Environmental', 'Science & Math', 'Technology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Irving Granet'], 'title': 'Fluid Mechanics for Engineering Technology', 'isbn13': '9780133228762', 'msrp': 64, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0133228762', 'isbn10': '0133228762'}}
