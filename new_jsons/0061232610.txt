It doesn't matter how good her life is, and it is, it never feels good enough. She has four godchildren and dozens of friends, yet love eludes her. She knows how good a mother she could be, if only she had the chance. And then one terrible day she does, and Tessa learns firsthand that life on the other side of that white picket fence is more complicated than she ever could have imagined.<br/>Heartwarming, funny, and genuine, The Godmother speaks to anyone who has wondered about the next step and reminds us that happily-ever-after is just the beginning of the story.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/19/9780061232619.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Godmother', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.79}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2008-06-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Friendship', 'Mothers & Children', 'Contemporary', 'British & Irish', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Carrie Adams'], 'title': 'The Godmother', 'isbn13': '9780061232619', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061871508'}, 'isbn': '0061232610', 'isbn10': '0061232610', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061871504', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
