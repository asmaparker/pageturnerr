She\'s never faced a situation she couldn\'t comment about -- especialy online! She lives in Chicago with her husband, LT, and her large cat, The Cat -- not to be confused with Kat (female friend, good for fashion advice, philosophical discussions, and getting into trouble in bars). She\'s never had a cavity and likes to look in other people\'s medicine cabinets. She\'s witty, urbane, outrageous, an international sensation; she\'s got a unique, smartypants take on ordinary life and its rampant surreality. And absolutely nothing is sacred or taboo -- not men, marriage, beer, religion, sex, marital aids, or motherhood.<br/>Get ready world -- because Mimi\'s going to explain it all to you!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/66/9780060786366.jpg', 'title_long': 'The World According to Mimi Smartypants', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.58}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.43}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2005-12-27', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Friendship', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Mimi Smartypants'], 'title': 'The World According to Mimi Smartypants', 'isbn13': '9780060786366', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060786361', 'isbn10': '0060786361'}}
