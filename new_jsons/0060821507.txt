{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Cemetery tour guide Pepper Martin never imagined she'd get to meet rock legend Damon Curtis, the bad boy poet who made millions of teenage girls scream. After all, he kicked the bucket years before she was born. But thanks to her newfound ability to chat up the dead, Pepper's got a front row seat perfect for swooning over the still-sexy Damon's latest lyrics. He's convinced that his former bandmate Vinnie Pallucci murdered him back in â€˜71, and he's promised Pepper she won't get any rest or peace until she helps him prove it.<br/>But when Pepper goes behind the music, she finds Vinnie with a knife in his heart and the rest of the band members running for their lives. And if Pepper doesn't snare the killer soon, Damon's next hit from the great beyond might be her swan song.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/00/9780060821500.jpg', 'title_long': 'Tombs of Endearment (Pepper Martin Mysteries, No. 3)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2007-09-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'International Mystery & Crime', 'Supernatural', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Casey Daniels'], 'title': 'Tombs of Endearment (Pepper Martin Mysteries, No. 3)', 'isbn13': '9780060821500', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061841463'}, 'isbn': '0060821507', 'isbn10': '0060821507', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061841460', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
