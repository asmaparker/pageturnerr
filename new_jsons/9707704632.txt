{'book': {'publisher': 'Alfaguara', 'synopsis': 'Napoleon Bonaparte lives in exile, a prisoner in the island of Saint Helen. Every morning he religiously records his memoirs, carefully manipulating them to establish his glory for posterity. The life of a man who is known to have said, my only lover was power, is forever changed by a knock on his door. The moment Miss Betsy Balcombe walks into his life, Napoleon loses himself in her scent, in her gaze, in the delicious curves of her body. His every waking moment is spent in her company, everything else forgotten while dark forces are conspiring to end the life of a legend, a dictator and a military genius.', 'language': 'es', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/33/9789707704633.jpg', 'title_long': 'Viento Amargo (Spanish Edition)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.77951 Inches, Length: 5.62991 Inches, Weight: 0.580036211322 Pounds, Width: 0.66929 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.62991}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.66929}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.580036211322}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.77951}}, 'pages': 182, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Beatriz Rivas'], 'title': 'Viento Amargo (Spanish Edition)', 'isbn13': '9789707704633', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9707704632', 'isbn10': '9707704632'}}
