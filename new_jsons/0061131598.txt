{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "In high school, the last thing you want is for people to think you talk to ghosts.<br/>When Sparrow begins tenth grade at a huge new school full of strangers, she thinks her dreams of anonymity and a fresh start are finally coming true. No more following in her six older sisters' footsteps. No more going to class with kids who've seen her grandma doing jujitsu in the front yard next to the headstones of her four dead husbands. And no more worrying about keeping her deep, dark secret hidden.<br/>Sparrow makes a new best friend and has her eye on an irritatingly appealing guy in her history class. She feels like she's well on her way to a normal life. But it's another boy—a dead one—who wants Sparrow's attention, and he won't let her be till she's helped him Move On.<br/>You see, Sparrow Delaney's secret is that she's a psychic. And there's one very persistent ghost who won't let her forget it.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/92/9780061131592.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Secret Life of Sparrow Delaney', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2007-07-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Spine-Chilling Horror', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Horror', 'Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Suzanne Harper'], 'title': 'The Secret Life of Sparrow Delaney', 'isbn13': '9780061131592', 'msrp': 17.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0061131598', 'isbn10': '0061131598'}}
