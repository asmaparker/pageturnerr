{'book': {'publisher': 'John Benjamins Publishing Company', 'synopsis': 'In her book, Barbe discusses verbal irony as an interpretative notion. Verbal irony is described in its various realizations and thus placed within linguistics and pragmatics. From the point of view of an analyzing observer, Barbe provides an eclectic approach to irony in context, a study of how conversational irony works, and how it compares with other concepts in which it plays a role. In addition, by means of the analysis of irony as an integrated pervasive feature of language, Barbe questions some basic unstated, literacy and culture-dependent assumptions about language. Her study of irony complements contemporary research in the area of conversational analysis.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/69/9789027250469.jpg', 'title_long': 'Irony in Context (Pragmatics & Beyond New Series)', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.9479877266 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9479877266}}, 'pages': 216, 'date_published': '1995-12-08', 'subjects': ['Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Linguistics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Katharina Barbe'], 'title': 'Irony in Context (Pragmatics & Beyond New Series)', 'isbn13': '9789027250469', 'msrp': 280, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '9027250464', 'isbn10': '9027250464'}}
