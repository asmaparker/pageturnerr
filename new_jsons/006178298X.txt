{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "“Wonderful. . . . A must read come holiday time.”—Roanoke Times<br/>“Nobody does Christmas like Mary Kay Andrews.” — Debbie Macomber<br/>New York Times bestselling author Mary Kay Andrews's rollicking Christmas tale featuring the beloved characters from Savannah Blues and Savannah Breeze<br/>'Tis the week before Christmas, and antiques dealer Weezie Foley is in a frenzy to do up her shop right for the Savannah historical district decorating contest, which she fully intends to win. Her motif is Graceland Blue Christmas, with lots of tinsel, an aluminum tree, and enough tacky retro doodads to fill the Grand Ole Opry. But no sooner is she certain she's one-upped the trendy shop around the corner when Weezie notices things going strangely missing from her display.<br/>Despite the petty burglaries of her mysterious midnight visitor, Weezie still has high hopes for the holiday. Perhaps even an engagement ring is in the offing from her chef boyfriend, though Daniel, usually moody around the yuletide, seems even more distant than ever. Throw in some seasonal eccentricities from Weezie's decidedly odd family, a miraculous 1950s Christmas-tree pin, and a little help from the King (Elvis!) himself, and even Scrooge would have to agree there's real magic in the Savannah air this Christmas.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/85/9780061782985.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blue Christmas', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.2866009406 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.64}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.2866009406}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2009-11-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Holidays', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Humor', 'Southern', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Mary Kay Andrews'], 'title': 'Blue Christmas', 'isbn13': '9780061782985', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '006178298X', 'isbn10': '006178298X'}}
