{'book': {'publisher': 'Cornerstone Digital', 'synopsis': "When her perfect world shatters, can Eva pick up the pieces?<br/><br/>Sixteen years ago Eva Montgomery had everything going for her, but her life changed forever when she fell in love with the wrong man. Shortly afterwards she was viciously attacked by a stalker, left disfigured, and forced to give up what was most precious to her for the chance of a new life for them both. Now, Eva has managed to rebuild her life in a way that seemed impossible after the attack. Her home in Dorset, high on the cliffs overlooking the sea, is as elegant as Eva herself, but bears none of the scars. The love she shares with her husband, Don, has become the very mainstay of her existence. Her beloved sister lives nearby. To an outsider, Eva's world seems perfect, however, behind the facade there is more tragedy and deceit than even she is aware of. When the past starts to invade the present, Eva wonders if she'll ever be able to break free from a past that nearly destroyed herâ€”and is threatening to do so again.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/23/9780099550723.jpg', 'title_long': 'No Turning Back', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.999984 Inches, Length: 4.99999 Inches, Weight: 0.82232423726 Pounds, Width: 1.2999974 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.99999}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.2999974}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.82232423726}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.999984}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2011-05-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Billionaires', 'Kindle Store', 'Categories', 'Kindle eBooks', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Susan Lewis'], 'title': 'No Turning Back', 'isbn13': '9780099550723', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Kindle Edition', 'isbn': '0099550725', 'isbn10': '0099550725'}}
