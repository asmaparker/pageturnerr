{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': 'Leo\'s papa stood in the doorway, gazing down at him. "Leo, you make gold from pebbles," and the way he said it, Leo could tell that this was a good thing.<br/>He may have been given a bit part in the school play ... but Leo dreams he is the biggest star on Broadway.<br/>Sure, his big, noisy family makes him feel like a sardine squashed in a tin ... but in his fantasy he gets all the attention he wants.<br/>Yes, his papa seems sad and distracted ... but Leo imagines him as a boy, tap-dancing and singing with delight.<br/>That\'s why they call Leo "fog boy." He\'s always dreaming, always replaying things in his brain. He fantasizes about who he is in order to discover who he will become. As an actor in the school play, he is poised and ready for the curtain to open. But in the play that is his life, Leo is eager to discover what part will be his.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/97/9780060540197.jpg', 'title_long': 'Replay', 'edition': '1st ptg.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.85}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2005-09-27', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Arts, Music & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Sharon Creech'], 'title': 'Replay', 'isbn13': '9780060540197', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060540192', 'isbn10': '0060540192'}}
