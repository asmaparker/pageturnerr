{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTeen', 'synopsis': "What do you get when ordinary e-mail spam becomes infused with magic? Spellspam—and it's not supposed to exist. As far as Thea and her friends know, computers are meant to be inert vehicles for storing magic spells, not magical processors themselves. But all that seems to have changed as students at Wandless Academy find themselves the victim of practical jokes—with magical consequences—simply by opening an e-mail.<br/>Now the spellspams are getting worse, and it's possible there's someone behind them who is not just bent on stirring up trouble but has a much scarier and more wide-reaching agenda. Until now, Thea has been the only person she's ever met who can reach through the computer using magic. But someone else is out there, and even her friends can't help her track down the source of the spellspam before it gets much, much worse.<br/>This sequel to Worldweavers: Gift of the Unmage ups the ante on a fantasy world that is rich and nuanced, like our own, but with a core of wildly original magic.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/81/9780060839581.jpg', 'title_long': 'Worldweavers: Spellspam', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.37 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.37}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2008-03-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Girls & Women', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Alma Alexander'], 'title': 'Worldweavers: Spellspam', 'isbn13': '9780060839581', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060839589', 'isbn10': '0060839589'}}
