{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Marriage was her only means of escape . . .<br/>Though Honora Tannach came of age amid the misty moors of the Scottish highlands, where warring clans battled to the death for the future of their wild land, nothing frightens her so much as a lifetime trapped in the castle of her cruel stepfather. She is thrilled when a marriage is arranged to the son of a Scottish laird . . . until her betrothed is revealed to be Cavan Sinclare. Though the savage warrior once saved her life, Honora knows no one can tame the heart of such a brute, no matter now finely chiseled his features or how enticing his eyes . . . .<br/>After escaping his captors, Cavan's only concern is protecting his clan from the menacing invaders who threaten at every turnâ€”and his beautiful wife is a dangerous distraction. But in the face of fiery passion, their reluctance will fade . . . and Cavan will discover that there is no greater strength than the power of true love.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/39/9780061375439.jpg', 'title_long': 'Return of the Rogue (A Sinclare Brothers Series, 1)', 'edition': 'First Avon Books Paperback Printing Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.39903669422 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.39903669422}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-02-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Medieval', 'Scottish', 'Victorian', 'Romantic Suspense'], 'authors': ['Donna Fletcher'], 'title': 'Return of the Rogue (A Sinclare Brothers Series, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061375439', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061753157'}, 'isbn': '0061375438', 'isbn10': '0061375438', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061753152', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
