{'book': {'publisher': 'Regan Books', 'synopsis': 'A comprehensive, take-anywhere exercise program designed to improve men\'s strength, flexibility, balance, and posture<br/>Have years of office work wreaked havoc on your posture? Could your tennis or golf game use a boost? Do you appear or feel older than your age? Or do you carry yourself in a manner that expresses strength, power, and peak performance to everyone around you?<br/>In recent years, Pilates has become a popular exercise program, especially among women. Many books on the subject show lithe female bodies stretched across their covers. Top Pilates instructor Daniel Lyon Jr. aims to break the preconception that Pilates only benefits and appeals to women. "This couldn\'t be further from the truth," he asserts. "Joseph Pilates was a cigar-smoking boxer, acrobat, and gymnast, and he developed his exercise program from that background for men first." Likewise, Lyon designed this book specifically with men in mind, as the number of male Pilates practitioners -- among them professional athletes, actors, businessmen, and other high-profile personalities -- has rocketed to about three million and continues to grow.<br/>For athletes, working stiffs, and men recovering from injuries, Lyon offers the first comprehensive exercise program of its kind. He walks you through forty "traditional mat" exercises and more than sixty "reformer on the mat" exercises -- each one brilliantly illustrated -- in an inspiring self-guided program that adapts to all experience levels and requires nothing more than floor space, an exercise mat, and the desire to look and feel your best. Using the Pilates method of engaging the strongest parts of the body, or the "powerhouse" (Joseph Pilates\'s term for the abdominals, hips, lower back muscles, and buttocks), and integrating all other body parts from this core, Lyon\'s program targets trouble spots for men and helps them achieve strong, lean, masculine physiques.<br/>The Complete Book of Pilates for Men will deliver quick and long-term results to any man who seeks optimal fitness and a competitive edge in all aspects of his life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/70/9780060820770.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Complete Book of Pilates for Men: The Lifetime Plan for Strength, Power & Peak Performance', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.12 Inches, Length: 7.38 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.38}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.88}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.00089866948}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.12}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2005-09-27', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Exercise & Fitness', 'Ab Workouts', 'Pilates', 'Stretching', 'Yoga', "Men's Health", 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Gender Studies'], 'authors': ['Daniel Lyon'], 'title': 'The Complete Book of Pilates for Men: The Lifetime Plan for Strength, Power & Peak Performance', 'isbn13': '9780060820770', 'msrp': 19.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060820772', 'isbn10': '0060820772'}}
