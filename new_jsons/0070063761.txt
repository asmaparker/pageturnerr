{'book': {'publisher': 'International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press', 'synopsis': 'Here are 75 novel and wonderful boats--some strange, some beautiful, all of them paragons of Philip Bolger\'s form-follows-function design philosophy. A planing microtrawler; a glass-galleried, beachable birdwatching boat; a fully enclosed ocean-cruising rowboat; cruising sailboats that take the ground at low tide; power, sail, and rowing boats from 6 to 95 feet--these are boats as only Bolger\'s unfettered imagination does them. This is the first collection of Bolger\'s work in almost 15 years. It is long overdue.<br/>"Bolger is an eloquent writer and his comments run the gamut from hilarious to profound."--The Ensign<br/>"Bolger brings a kind of youthful feeling to yacht design--he would rather make precedent than follow it."--WoodenBoat<br/>"Bolger has a way of seducing even the lay reader into thinking about and beginning to understand boat design."--Cruising World<br/>"Boat lovers who are used to designers who conceive the same boat over and over, camouflaged with a face-lifting here and there, will be amazed at Phil Bolger\'s diversity."--Boatbuilder', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/61/9780070063761.jpg', 'title_long': 'Boats with an Open Mind: Seventy-Five Unconventional Designs and Concepts', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 7.2 Inches, Weight: 1.64905771976 Pounds, Width: 0.95 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.95}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.64905771976}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.2}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '1994-09-22', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Transportation', 'Ships', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Water Sports', 'Boating', 'Sailing'], 'authors': ['Philip Bolger'], 'title': 'Boats with an Open Mind: Seventy-Five Unconventional Designs and Concepts', 'isbn13': '9780070063761', 'msrp': 41, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0070063761', 'isbn10': '0070063761'}}
