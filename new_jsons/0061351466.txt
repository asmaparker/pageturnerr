She has eloquently and fairly exposed a dark side to our sport that parents have long needed to be made aware of.”<br/>—Dominique Moceanu, Olympic Gold Medal Winning Gymnast<br/>Fanciful dreams of becoming the next Nadia Comaneci led Jennifer Sey to become a gymnast at the age of six. Her early success propelled her family to sacrifice everything to help her become, by age 11, one of America’s elite. But as she set her sights higher and higher, Jennifer began to change, setting her needs, her health, and her well-being aside in the name of winning. And the adults in her life refused to notice her downward spiral.<br/><br/>Now, Sey reveals the tarnish beneath her gold medals.
