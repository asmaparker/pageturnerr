{'book': {'publisher': 'Albatros/Argentina', 'synopsis': 'Product Description      Provides instructions on candlemaking, and outlines twenty-five decorative projects utilizing different techniques.      From Publishers Weekly      No number of halogen lights, flourescent tubes, and incandescent bulbs seems able to displace the age-old candle. These days every other shop seems to carry at least four or five varieties of wax-burners, many of them running as much as $20 a pop, so there\'s little doubt that Leon and Rossi\'s guide to making candles at home will find a receptive audience among readers interested in crafts. Projects include making angel-shaped candles, Santa Claus candles, sand candles, wax-flower candles, valentine candles, lantern-like millfiori candles, pyramid candles, and beer-mug-shaped candles. Like Rossi\'s book on glass painting (see below), this how-to is packed with photographs, and each project is illustrated step-by-step with line drawings. This book, however, provides a more thorough introduction of the craft\'s techniques and tools, and its hardcover binding is sturdier, making it a better choice for libraries than Rossi\'s other book.
