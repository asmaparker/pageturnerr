A famous Cuban painter who has lived his entire life in exile returns to Baracoa to be reunited with his childhood. What he finds, however, is not the place of his childhood memories. As he roams about the streets of the city, the painter does not see what surrounds him; he becomes the child he once was in order to relive his childhood all over again.', 'language': 'es', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/38/9788466322638.jpg', 'title_long': 'Paisaje con río y Baracoa de fondo (FORMATO GRANDE) (Spanish Edition)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.4803 Inches, Length: 4.92125 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.55118 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.92125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.55118}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.4803}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2009', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'World Literature', 'European', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Luis Leante'], 'title': 'Paisaje con río y Baracoa de fondo (FORMATO GRANDE) (Spanish Edition)', 'isbn13': '9788466322638', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '8466322639', 'isbn10': '8466322639'}}
