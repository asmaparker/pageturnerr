Just across the western channel, her colony Ireland is embroiled in seething rebellion, the island\'s fierceuntamed clan chieftains and their "wild Irish" followers refusing to bow to their English oppressors.<br/>In the midst of the conflict is Grace O\'Malley, notorious pirate, gunrunner, and "Mother of the Irish Rebellion." For years, the audacious Grace has plotted and fought against the English stranglehold on her beloved country.
