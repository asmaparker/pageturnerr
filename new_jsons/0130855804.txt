{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall Direct', 'synopsis': 'The go-to authority for budgeting and financial matters affecting U.S. non-profit organizations, this tome remains extremely relevant, and is as useful today as it was in the mid-1990s since the focus of the book is on that part of running non-profits that does not change with tax laws and legislation -- internal budgeting and financial matters. The only exception here is that section of Part IV dealing with reporting standards, but here too the focus is not so much on the filling of forms which change but on HAVING a reporting function and capability that is at once transparent and accurate. A great book for those non-profits who, of course, are on a budget.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/00/9780130855800.jpg', 'title_long': 'Handbook of Budgeting for Nonprofit Organizations', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 2.75 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 510, 'date_published': '1996', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Business Development & Entrepreneurship', 'Nonprofit Organizations & Charities', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Jae K.
