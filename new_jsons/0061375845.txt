{'book': {'publisher': 'Katherine Tegen Books', 'synopsis': "There are the small betrayals: the unkind word, the petty lies. And there are the betrayals that break hearts, destroy worlds, and turn the strong sweet light of day into bitter dust.<br/>When Evie Johnson started at Wyldcliffe Abbey School for Young Ladies, her life changed in ways she couldn't possibly have envisioned: the discovery of her link with Lady Agnes, her special bond with Helen and Sarah, and their sisterhood in the astonishing secrets of the Mystic Way. Above all, Evie's love for Sebastian has turned her world upside down.<br/>Now Evie returns to Wyldcliffe for another term and more danger. Surrounded by enemies, she lives every day in fear that Sebastian will fall into the darkness of servitude to the Unconquered Lords. The Wyldcliffe coven is plotting to destroy Evie and use Sebastian to secure their own immortality. Evie and her sisters must master the power of the Talisman before it is too late. But could it be Sebastian himself who will ultimately betray Evie?<br/>In this companion to Gillian Shields's dazzling Immortal, magic and sweeping romance cross the bounds of time to deliver heart-stopping emotion and suspense.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/42/9780061375842.jpg', 'title_long': 'Betrayal (Immortal, 2)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.00089866948 Pounds, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.00089866948}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2010-08-03', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Girls & Women', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Paranormal'], 'authors': ['Gillian Shields'], 'title': 'Betrayal (Immortal, 2)', 'isbn13': '9780061375842', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061375845', 'isbn10': '0061375845'}}
