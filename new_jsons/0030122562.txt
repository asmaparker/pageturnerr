{'book': {'publisher': 'Henry Holt & Co', 'synopsis': 'Naturally, as per the title, Hester takes a position as an assistant manager at a manor-turned-small hotel near Edinburgh. During the course of the novel, one marriage breaks up while another seems imminent, thanks to some help with what seemed to be a doomed romance. The Christie children, Bryan and Betty, seem terribly grown up. Hester crosses paths again with the lovelorn Tony Morley, now a brigadier general. But all in all, the enjoyment for the reader comes from the delightful and realistic characters and the small but amusing incidents that happen in the course of everyday life.
