{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Carolyn Turner, Viscountess Wingate, is absolutely shocked by the Ladies Literary Society of London's latest selection. Memoirs of a Mistress is scandalously explicit and downright wicked . . . and it's stirring feelings within Carolyn that she hasn't felt . . . well, ever! She's sure that this steamy read is the only reason she's succumbing to the charms of notorious rogue Daniel Sutton, Lord Surbrooke. She couldn't possibly be falling for the rascal and his illicit caresses . . . or could she?<br/>The last thing Daniel wanted was to be shackled by marriage vows. He lusted after Carolyn, sure, but he never imagined that once he lured her to his bed he'd never want to let her go. Yet only when a murderer targets his beloved will he be spurred to confess his true love . . . and claim Carolyn as his bride.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/91/9780061231391.jpg', 'title_long': 'Confessions at Midnight (Mayhem in Mayfair, Book 2)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.41446905256 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41446905256}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2007-12-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Victorian', 'Regency', 'Western'], 'authors': ["Jacquie D'Alessandro"], 'title': 'Confessions at Midnight (Mayhem in Mayfair, Book 2)', 'isbn13': '9780061231391', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061740667'}, 'isbn': '0061231398', 'isbn10': '0061231398', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061740664', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
