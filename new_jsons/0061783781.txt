But now they're in middle school, where their extensive mica collection and prowess at kickball have earned them a new label: losers. Then Peter attracts the unwanted attention of the school bullies, and his plan to become popular through his older sister, the practically perfect Sunny, backfires.<br/>Things go from bad to worse when Peter gets detention. But what at first seems to spell his utter doom turns into an unlikely opportunity for making friends and influencing people. . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/84/9780061783784.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Detention Club', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.82893810512 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.82893810512}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2011-06-21', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Humor', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Multicultural Stories', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['David Yoo'], 'title': 'The Detention Club', 'isbn13': '9780061783784', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061783781', 'isbn10': '0061783781'}}
