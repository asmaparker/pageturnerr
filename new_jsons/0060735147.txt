{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "The amazing story of Dr. Phil McGraw's beloved sister–in–law, an ordinary woman transformed by tragedy who has become an extraordinary hero for us all.<br/>In 2001, Cindi Broaddus was a passenger in a car driving along a lonely highway on her way toward a much–anticipated vacation. Suddenly, the predawn peace was shattered when an unknown assailant threw a gallon–sized jar full of sulphuric acid off an overpass and through the windshield. Though Broaddus was covered with second– and third–degree burns across her face and body, miraculously she did not die.<br/>Today, she is not only alive and well, but has a positive message of survival and hope to share.<br/>A Random Account recounts Broaddus's incredible journey from life–threatening disaster to recovery. Throughout her years–long, often excruciating recuperation – involving numerous reconstructive surgeries, multiple skin grafts, and implanted tissue expanders – this single mother of three has had one goal: to prevent such a terrible crime from happening again. Although her attacker has never been caught, Broaddus travels far and wide, sharing her story, lobbying for improving highway safety, and offering hope and down–to–earth guidance for other victims of senseless tragedy. For such a random act can happen to anyone, turning one's life upside down in an instant. As compelling as it is important, A Random Act is a must–read tale of tragedy and triumph from a truly remarkable woman.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/42/9780060735142.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Random Act: An Inspiring True Story of Fighting to Survive and Choosing to Forgive', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2005-04-12', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime'], 'authors': ['Cindi Broaddus', 'Kimberly Lohman Suiters'], 'title': 'A Random Act: An Inspiring True Story of Fighting to Survive and Choosing to Forgive', 'isbn13': '9780060735142', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060735147', 'isbn10': '0060735147'}}
