{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': 'Phillip has a lot on his mind. At home, in his unnecessarily large, excessively expensive house, he is attempting to become a Taoist<br/>master of love with his wife, Alice, but his quest is forever being interrupted by the requests of his twin daughters -- "Can we have a pony, please?"; "We want to go to boarding school." At work, in his shed/office at the bottom of the garden, between countless games of Minesweeper and FreeCell, Phillip is trying to pay the mortgage by writing the instruction manuals to Korean bread-making machines. And at parties where he is concerned that he is not taken seriously -- he is variously mistaken as a waiter and a rhinoplastic surgeon -- Phillip tells the world he is, in fact, a screenwriter.<br/>Above all, Phillip is obsessing about his best friends, Barry and Sean. They are rich, more successful, and, most worryingly, they give great presents. Their gifts are always exquisite -- a full set of Italian crockery, a handmade corkscrew from Venice; they give them on birthdays, at parties, and quite often for no reason whatsoever; and, increasingly, these presents break all bounds of generosity.<br/>They are gifts that hurt a man\'s pride. And they can never be matched. Which doesn\'t mean Phillip won\'t try. . . .', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/30/9780007157730.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Gift: A Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2003-10-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'British & Irish', 'Contemporary', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['David Flusfeder'], 'title': 'The Gift: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780007157730', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0007157738', 'isbn10': '0007157738'}}
