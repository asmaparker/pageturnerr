{'book': {'publisher': 'Wharton School Pub', 'synopsis': 'You are the CEO of your life: you, and nobody else. You can establish the new rules that will help you achieve true balance between work and the rest of your life. And if you don\'t do it, nobody else will. Now is the time to take control, and this is the book that will get you there. CEO of Me is like no other "work-life balance" book you\'ve ever seen: there are no clich√©s here, and no one-size-fits all solutions. Instead, Drs. Ellen Kossek and Brenda Lautsch help you identify which of six worklife "patterns" you fit into and how to move towards a pattern that\'s more productive and comfortable for you, one step at a time. As leaders of North America\'s largest research projects on work/life balance, Kossek and Lautsch are singularly well-qualified to write this book. Drawing on their unparalleled research insights, they show how to identify the personal triggers that cause you the greatest stress...make the small changes that make the biggest difference...make technology work for you, not against you...redraw the lines between work and family as your life changes...master powerful strategies for managing yourself, your colleagues, and your supervisors...leverage emerging work options that are available to our generation for the first time. The authors\' radical new approach will transform the way you view both your work and your life and help you make the practical changes that lead to true fulfillment.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/94/9780132349994.jpg', 'title_long': 'CEO of Me: Creating a Life That Works in the Flexible Job Age', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.8598028218 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8598028218}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 183, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Business Culture', 'Workplace Culture', 'Skills'], 'authors': ['Ellen Ernst Kossek', 'Brenda A.
