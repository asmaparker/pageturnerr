{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon A', 'synopsis': '"I have written about the joys of love. I have, in my secret heart, long dreamt of an intimate connection with a man; every Jane, I believe, deserves her Rochester."<br/>Though poor, plain, and unconnected, Charlotte Bronte possesses a deeply passionate side which she reveals only in her writings—creating Jane Eyre and other novels that stand among literature\'s most beloved works. Living a secluded life in the wilds of Yorkshire with her sisters Emily and Anne, their drug-addicted brother, and an eccentric father who is going blind, Charlotte Bronte dreams of a real love story as fiery as the ones she creates.<br/>But it is in the pages of her diary where Charlotte exposes her deepest feelings and desires—and the truth about her life, its triumphs and shattering disappointments, her family, the inspiration behind her work, her scandalous secret passion for the man she can never have . . . and her intense, dramatic relationship with the man she comes to love, the enigmatic Arthur Bell Nicholls.<br/>"Who is this man who has dared to ask for my hand? Why is my father so dead set against him? Why are half the residents of Haworth determined to lynch him—or shoot him?"<br/>From Syrie James, the acclaimed, bestselling author of The Lost Memoirs of Jane Austen, comes a powerfully compelling, intensely researched literary feat that blends historical fact and fiction to explore the passionate heart and unquiet soul of Charlotte Bronte. It is Charlotte\'s story, just as she might have written it herself.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/73/9780061648373.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bronte', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.93916923612 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.82}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.93916923612}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 454, 'date_published': '2009-03-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Biographical', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Opera'], 'authors': ['Syrie James'], 'title': 'The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bronte', 'isbn13': '9780061648373', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061891770'}, 'isbn': '006164837X', 'isbn10': '006164837X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061891779', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
