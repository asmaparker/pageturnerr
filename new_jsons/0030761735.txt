{'book': {'publisher': 'Saunders College Pub', 'synopsis': "This classic mid to high-level applications-oriented text for the two-semester applied calculus course for business, economics, allied health, and life and social science majors provides examples and applications from business and life sciences. It presents new material on the range of functions, logarithmic differentiation, differential equations, and Newton's Method. Berkey's unique split strategy/solution format teaches calculus using extensive worked examples and extensive graded exercise sets. * Provides useful mathematical models for interesting phenomena such as the spread of pollution and disease, the growth and optimal harvesting of biological populations, and the behavior of financial instruments and markets. * Teaches students how to use calculus to determine the rates of change among variables of interest, and to measure the difference between functions, usually on finite intervals - essential mathematical skills for students studying many different fields. * Extensive worked examples make use of a split strategy/solution format that shows students how the mathematical thinking progresses with the actual steps of a problem solution. * Over 400 illustrations and figures assist students in the visualization of mathematical ideas. * Over 3,000 exercises, 700 New to this * Over 80 new applications from the biological and environmental sciences provide interesting settings for applying relevant mathematics - population growth for plants, animals, forestry, ecology, epidemics and oceanography. * Practice Problems with worked solutions now appear at the end of every section, allowing students to test their understanding of basic concepts before working the exercises. * New Preface to the Students describes what mathematical modeling is and how it is used to interpret applied problems in mathematical terms. * New math topics include oblique asymptotes (2.4), symmetry and even/odd functions (3.5), mathematical modeling (4.2, 4.4, 4.6), approximations and differentials (3.10, 6.5) and relative and percentage errors (6.5).", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/37/9780030761737.jpg', 'title_long': 'Applied Calculus', 'edition': '3', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 4.09177958272 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 4.09177958272}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 7, 'date_published': '1994', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Dennis D.
