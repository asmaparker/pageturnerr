She'd love to meet the right guy who'd be willing to explore the naughty and the unknown with her -- sensible, capable, practical Jenifer Janey Wright -- and not insist on putting a ring on her finger. One look at sexy, mysterious Eric Hamilton and she can read right off the bat that he's the love 'em and leave 'em type, the perfect partner for exploring her sensual fantasies from A to Z!<br/>… Or a Lifetime of Love?<br/>Undercover agent Eric Hamilton is in Doolittle, Arkansas, only long enough to break up a funny-money ring. He's certain this sexy librarian is involved in some way. It's hard to stay all-business when it's his job to get as close as it takes to his suspects, especially when Jenifer makes him an offer no hot-blooded man could resist. Can Eric only play at love or has this surprisingly tender and vulnerable woman captured not only his imagination -- but also his heart?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/02/9780060582302.jpg', 'title_long': 'Love: Undercover', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-05-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'Ancient World', 'Victorian', 'Science Fiction', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Hailey North'], 'title': 'Love: Undercover', 'isbn13': '9780060582302', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061840009'}, 'isbn': '0060582308', 'isbn10': '0060582308', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061840005', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
