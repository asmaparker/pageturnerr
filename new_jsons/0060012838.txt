{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'A charming memoir and cookbook that celebrates the connections women make through cooking and food<br/>Every woman has poignant food memories: The first time she helped her mother bake a cake, or helped her grandmother make blintzes, tortillas, or Southern fried chicken. And how about the times she and her girlfriends baked chocolate-chip cookies, or, later, prepared elaborate dinners to impress potential husbands? Let Us Eat Cake celebrates these connections.<br/>As a young girl, Sharon Boorstin helped her mother make tuna casseroles; on a college trip to Europe, she and her girlfriends compared men and restaurants with equal zest; after she became a food writer, Boorstin bonded with women in the food world, including Barbara Lazaroff (Mrs. Wolfgang) Puck and Julia Child. Today, after decades of food and cooking, Boorstin and the women in her life cook together for the sheer pleasure of it, and they have come to understand what truly makes for female friendships.<br/>With dozens of delicious recipes and vintage photos, this moving book will inspire readers to remember and cherish their own experiences with food and friends.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/30/9780060012830.jpg', 'title_long': 'Let Us Eat Cake: Adventures in Food and Friendship', 'edition': 'First Edition first Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2002-04-16', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Friendship', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Culinary', 'Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Parenting & Relationships'], 'authors': ['Sharon Boorstin'], 'title': 'Let Us Eat Cake: Adventures in Food and Friendship', 'isbn13': '9780060012830', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060012838', 'isbn10': '0060012838'}}
