{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': 'Computer Systems Performance Modeling was written to help designers, developers, and others achieve optimum system effectiveness at the lowest lifetime cost. "It is common, but unfortunate," authors Sauer and Chandy point out, "that performance is not seriously considered until the later stages of system evolution" when remedies, such as the acquisition of additional hardware, can be costly. An attractive alternative to after-the-fact modifications is the mathematical model that estimates performance early in the design and development stages and permits appropriate adjustments before the system becomes operational. This comprehensive volume introduces the key concepts of modeling, their practical application, and their management. Well written, detailed chapters cover general principles, Markovian queuing networks, approximation, simulation, measurement and parameter estimation, case studies, and management of modeling projects.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/53/9780131651753.jpg', 'title_long': 'Computer Systems Performance Modeling', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.73724262456 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.73724262456}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '1981', 'subjects': ['Computers & Technology', 'Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Charles H.
