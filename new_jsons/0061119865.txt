{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Cookbooks', 'synopsis': "Can't tell a Gin Fizz from a Gimlet? Think a Sidecar is something you'd see at the racetrack? If your idea of a wild night is a few Lemondrop shots washed back with a Cosmo, you're in need of some cocktail therapy! And there's no one better to tell you everything you need to know about a Brandy Crusta, a French 75, a Cachaça Swing, and much, much more than Ti Adelaide Martin and Lally Brennan, who will take you on a rip-roaring trip. . . .<br/>In the Land of Cocktails<br/>Proprietors of the legendary New Orleans restaurant Commander's Palace, Ti and Lally are cocktail divas, spread-ing the gospel about how to make drinks properly, from why a true Sazerac can only be made with Peychaud's bitters to why hand-chipped ice is best for cocktails. In this marvelously entertaining book—both a guide to making some of the world's best cocktails and a memoir of the authors' lives surrounded by family, friends, and delicious food—there are recipes for familiar classics like the Corpse Reviver and the Old-Fashioned; New Orleans favorites like Brandy Milk Punch and the Sazerac; and new inventions created by Ti and Lally, such as their now-famous Whoa, Nellie!<br/>In the Land of Cocktails includes information on pairing food with cocktails, introductions to the beloved, boisterous Brennan family and their friends, and explanations of some of the unique, perhaps strange to some, words and ways of life in New Orleans. Filled with wit, sass, warmth, and lots of good times, In the Land of Cocktails is the ideal gift for cocktail lovers everywhere, whether you're a novice or an old drinking pro.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/66/9780061119866.jpg', 'title_long': 'In the Land of Cocktails: Recipes and Adventures from the Cocktail Chicks', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.42 Inches, Length: 6.42 Inches, Weight: 1.04 Pounds, Width: 0.69 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.42}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.69}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.42}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2007-10-30', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Beverages & Wine', 'Cocktails & Mixed Drinks', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Homebrewing, Distilling & Wine Making'], 'authors': ['Ti Adelaide Martin', 'Lally Brennan'], 'title': 'In the Land of Cocktails: Recipes and Adventures from the Cocktail Chicks', 'isbn13': '9780061119866', 'msrp': 19.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061877549'}, 'isbn': '0061119865', 'isbn10': '0061119865', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061877544', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
