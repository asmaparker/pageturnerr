{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Alongside the bestselling 9/11 Commission Report is investigative journalist Peter Lance′s expose of the government′s decade long cover-up about al Qaeda, and how they′re still hiding the truth today.<br/>In the groundbreaking 1000 Years for Revenge, Peter Lance exposed the FBI′s twelve-year record of negligence that led to the attacks of 9/11. Now, alongside the bestselling 9/11 Commission Report, Lance′s Cover Up, proves that the government has been covering up its own counter-terror failures since the mid-1990s and continues to do so today.<br/>Part I presents new major revelations about Ramzi Yousef, bin Laden′s master bomber, and a plan to use his fellow prisoner, the convicted Mafioso Greg Scarpa Jr., to mine Yousef for information. In 1996, while Yousef was awaiting trial, the terrorist told Scarpa in detail how al Qaeda was planning to blow up an airliner in order to secure a mistrial. Yousef was even given access to an outside phone line so that the Feds could monitor his calls. But the plan backfired: Yousef reached his cohorts and TWA 800 was blown out of the sky. Yet the critical Scarpa intel was ultimately disregarded; if Scarpa were presented as a credible witness, it would have undermined a series of cases in which Scarpa had been rejected to protect a crooked FBI agent. The Feds threw away an opportunity to stop the biggest terror strike in the US before 9/11.<br/>Part II reveals the government′s continued cover up efforts, penetrating even the 9/11 Commission. Lance-who testified in private before the Commission-offers a minority report on the proceedings, revealing the many conflicts of interest among the commissioners and their personal motives for covering evidence and ignoring major parts of the story. Raising scores of unanswered questions, Cover Up proves one thing beyond a doubt: When it comes to understanding 9/11 we are as far from the truth as ever.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/15/9780060795115.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cover Up: What the Government Is Still Hiding About the War on Terror', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.11 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.11}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2005-09-06', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Peter Lance'], 'title': 'Cover Up: What the Government Is Still Hiding About the War on Terror', 'isbn13': '9780060795115', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061740934'}, 'isbn': '0060795115', 'isbn10': '0060795115', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061740930', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
