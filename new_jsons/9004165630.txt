Political Christianity with its emphasis on spectaculous and revelatory events provides the embeddings for the contemporary American world politics. This book examines how the recent seminal events - i.e. Kosovo, September 11th, Afghanistan, and Iraq - draw from the Western traditions of political religion. The key question is how these cultural resources are used to conserve and animate U.S. leadership and hegemony in world affairs. The result is a fresh overview into to the underpinnings of international relations. Table of Contents 1. Introduction 2. Epistemology of the Sacred 3. Theoretical Framework: Frames and Flows 4.
