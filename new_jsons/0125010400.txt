{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Genetics of Sex Differentiation intends to help readers understand the genetic basis of sex differentiation. The book focuses on explaining how the sex chromosomes affect the process of sex differentiation by influencing the rates at which cells divide. The book is composed of seven chapters. It provides overviews of classical genetics and structure of cells. It also explains the chromosomal basis of sex determination and sex determination using Drosophila. Polygenetics and continuous and quasicontinuous variations are also discussed. The book also discusses sex factors, determination, and disorders. Moreover, it explains the heterochromatin, embryological basis of sex differentiation, and triploidy and autosomal effects. In addition, it discusses the relationship of genes, chromosomes, growth, and sex. The book is an excellent ""bedside book"" for students in biology, specifically in genetics and developmental biology. Lecturers and professionals in biology and genetics will also find this book invaluable for their practice.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/05/9780125010405.jpg', 'title_long': 'Genetics of Sex Differentiation', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Page Fidelity', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 458}}, 'pages': 268, 'date_published': '1973-01-15', 'subjects': ['Genetics & Genomics', 'Botany', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Botany', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Genetics'], 'authors': ['Ursula Mittwoch'], 'title': 'Genetics of Sex Differentiation', 'isbn13': '9780125010405', 'msrp': 72.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0125010400', 'isbn10': '0125010400', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780323158503', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
