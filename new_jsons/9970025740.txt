{'book': {'publisher': 'Fountain Pub Ltd', 'synopsis': 'Lhukonzo is spoken by a large number of people in Uganda and Congo. This pioneering dictionary is intended for those wishing to learn and use either Lhukonzo or Enlish. It gives the basic vocabulary of words commonly used in speaking or writing about everyday subjects; and most words are therefore of a non-specialist character. It does not contain all possible Lhukonzo words because, for example, there are words use, d in Congo that have a French and other neighbouring local language influence. Words included are classified according to their grammatical classes and the class is shown after each entry. Introductory sections cover verbs, nouns, noun construction and their definitions, irregular classes of nouns and their construction and definitions, and abbreviations used. The author saw no literature in Lhukonzo during his schooling in the Rwenzori Mountains, and this dictionary is an important step in preserving the language.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/49/9789970025749.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lhukonzo-english/English-lhukonzo Dictionary', 'edition': 'Bilingual', 'dimensions': 'height: 229 mm, length: 152 mm, width: 19 mm, weight: 499 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 152}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 19}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 499}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 229}}, 'pages': 340, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Foreign Language Dictionaries & Thesauruses'], 'authors': ['Kambale, Balinandi'], 'title': 'Lhukonzo-english/English-lhukonzo Dictionary', 'isbn13': '9789970025749', 'msrp': 44.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9970025740', 'isbn10': '9970025740'}}
