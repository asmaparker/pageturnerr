{'book': {'publisher': 'HarpPeren', 'synopsis': 'Claire Newbold is not your typical heroine. Smart and sexy, yes, but she\'s also been known to sneak into a hotel room or two without paying, seduce a teenager in wet bathing trunks, and just check out of things altogether--like her job. And her marriage. No wonder, though. Claire\'s been careening off heartbreak. Her only child has died, she may be infertile, and her husband has had an affair.<br/>No longer a mother, not sure she wants to be a wife, Claire moves from hotel to hotel, basking in the anonymity of travel and forbidden sex. She even comes to believe she is clairvoyant, able to "read" into the souls of others. Eventually she begins to see into her own soul as she ponders whether or not to return home. As she struggles to repair her marriage and her life, Claire surprises herself -- and us -- by emerging with a new sense of redemption.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/93/9780060956493.jpg', 'title_long': 'Layover', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2000-05-16', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lisa Zeidner', 'Random House Inc.'], 'title': 'Layover', 'isbn13': '9780060956493', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060956496', 'isbn10': '0060956496'}}
