{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "Undine gets along well with her unconventional mother, she adores her baby brother, and she has a devoted kindred spirit in her best friend and next-door neighbor, Trout. It's inconvenient that Trout has a sloppy crush on her, but Undine tries to overlook this. Undine is basically satisfied . . . until strange things begin happening to her.<br/>It starts with an odd feeling, a shadow in the mirror, a whisper only Undine can hear: It's time to come home. And it builds. One hot day, when Undine imagines knitting together a few scattered clouds, she creates a massive thunderstorm.<br/>Who is Undine? Where does her power come from? What is she meant to do? Undine needs answers to these questions, so she sets off in search of a father she'd always believed was dead and a self she's only beginning to discover. But Undine's magic is powerful, wild, and dangerous -- and her feelings as she uncovers the truth are even fiercer. Will Undine find herself or lose herself . . . and everyone she loves?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/90/9780060793890.jpg', 'title_long': 'Undine', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2006-01-31', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Penni Russon'], 'title': 'Undine', 'isbn13': '9780060793890', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060793899', 'isbn10': '0060793899'}}
