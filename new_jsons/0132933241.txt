{'book': {'publisher': 'Parker', 'synopsis': "This book was designed for teachers who had to teach their own art in the classroom when art teachers were being coaxed into other positions at their schools, or dismissed entirely, along with music teachers, because of economic problems. It can be used by any student, any teacher, and even parents. The ideas are universal and useful for projects that need to be done for school science projects, art projects, or just for fun and the new knowledge gained. Children's capabilities can exceed the expectations we often hold for them. All children are capable of doing more complicated tasks and comprehending more detailed information than we think they can. The lessons developed for students are based on techniques and ideas that are a little more mature and advanced than expected for the particular age suggested. But the built-in flexibility of each lesson assures one hundred percent success. Although the final outcome should not be emphasized as the most important", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/47/9780132933247.jpg', 'title_long': 'Every Child an Artist: New Methods and Materials for Elementary Art', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.8 Inches, Length: 9.4 Inches, Width: 7.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}}, 'pages': 257, 'date_published': '1983', 'subjects': ['Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching'], 'authors': ['Barbara Ann Beswick'], 'title': 'Every Child an Artist: New Methods and Materials for Elementary Art', 'isbn13': '9780132933247', 'msrp': 17.5, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0132933241', 'isbn10': '0132933241'}}
