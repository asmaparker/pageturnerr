{'book': {'publisher': 'Brill', 'synopsis': 'The normative rhetoric of tannaitic literature (the earliest extant corpus of rabbinic Judaism) is predominantly deontological. Prior scholarship on rabbinic supererogation, and on points of contact with Greco-Roman virtue discourse, has identified non-deontological aspects of tannaitic normativity. However, these two frameworks overlook precisely the productive intersection of deontological with non-deontological, the first because supererogation defines itself against obligation, and the second because the Greco-Roman comparate discourages serious treatment of law-like elements. This book addresses ways in which alternative normative forms entwine with the core deontological rhetoric of tannaitic literature. This perspective exposes, inter alia, echoes of the post-biblical wisdom tradition in tannaitic law, the rich polyvalence of the category mitzvah, and telling differences between the schools of Akiva and Ishmael.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/80/9789004187580.jpg', 'title_long': 'What Is Good, and What God Demands: Normative Structures in Tannaitic Literature (Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.7 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.7}}, 'pages': 260, 'date_published': '2010-09-24', 'subjects': ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Judaism', 'Sacred Writings', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Novick'], 'title': 'What Is Good, and What God Demands: Normative Structures in Tannaitic Literature (Supplements to the Journal for the Study of Judaism)', 'isbn13': '9789004187580', 'msrp': 159, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '9004187588', 'isbn10': '9004187588'}}
