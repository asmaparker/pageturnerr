{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "A cutting-edge examination of the mysterious world of autoimmune disease—and the new discoveries made daily that may save women's lives<br/>Autoimmune diseases—including chronic fatigue syndrome, vasculitis, juvenile diabetes, alopecia, Graves' disease, Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis—are among the most devastating conditions afflicting women today and the most resistant to diagnosis and treatment. In all of them, the body's immune system begins to attack healthy and normally functioning cells. And one of the biggest puzzles is why 80 percent of autoimmune disease sufferers are women. In this groundbreaking book, world-class immunologist Dr. Robert Lahita brings years of intensive research, patient care, and diagnostics to shed light on the mysteries of these conditions, with a particular focus on how they affect—and how he treats—women.<br/>Through case studies, he reveals the early warning signs, symptoms, diagnostic processes, and the most innovative treatments for all the most common—and many of the less well known—autoimmune diseases. He offers a scientifically sound and sensitive work that is the best resource available to help understand these perplexing and debilitating diseases.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/08/9780060081508.jpg', 'title_long': 'Women and Autoimmune Disease: The Mysterious Ways Your Body Betrays Itself', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.91712300992 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91712300992}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2005-07-05', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diets & Weight Loss', 'Other Diets', 'Diseases & Physical Ailments', 'Heart Disease', 'Immune Systems', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', "Women's Health", 'General', 'Medical Books', 'Basic Sciences', 'Immunology', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine'], 'authors': ['Robert G.
