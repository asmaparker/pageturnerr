{'book': {'publisher': 'Merrill Publishing Company', 'synopsis': 'A core methods text for the Introduction to Early Childhood Education course.With an exciting new chapter on the emergent approach to fostering cognitive skills, the new edition of this text continues a tradition of offering future teachers of children ages 2 to 5 a complete, developmental approach to early childhood education...giving them the specific skills they need to function effectively with the children in their care. Rather than stressing such curriculum topics as "art" or "science," this text focuses on the "whole child" and what he/she needs from the learning environment in order to thrive. It pictures the child as being made up of "selves" - emotional, social, physical, creative, and cognitive...examines each of those selves in turn...and recommends methods and materials for enhancing growth in each area. This popular text is unique in that it combines a practical, realistic approach with a firm foundation in pertinent research topics.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16/44/9780023531644.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Whole Child: Developmental Education for the Early Years (6th Edition)', 'edition': '6th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.4488 Inches, Length: 7.4803 Inches, Weight: 2.6675933702 Pounds, Width: 1.1811 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.4803}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1811}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.6675933702}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.4488}}, 'pages': 651, 'date_published': '1995-11-08', 'subjects': ['Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Early Childhood Education', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Joanne Hendrick'], 'title': 'The Whole Child: Developmental Education for the Early Years (6th Edition)', 'isbn13': '9780023531644', 'msrp': 69, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0023531649', 'isbn10': '0023531649'}}
