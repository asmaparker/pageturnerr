{'book': {'publisher': 'Ponent Mon Ltd', 'synopsis': "[b]A VERY UNIQUE ENCOUNTER[/b] This project was formed as part of the celebrations of the 120th anniversary of Franco-Korean diplomatic relations with the support of the French Embassy in Seoul. In the very heart of Seoul, close to the Central Station and a stone's throw from the hotel where the French authors of this collection stayed, a huge billboard illustrates a visionary picture. The French high-speed TGV train route (KTX in Korean) links Seoul to Paris and Paris to Seoul with just a single line. For the Koreans it is not a joke, nor wild imagination, it is a project! So while you are waiting to travel to Seoul by land, here is the magic of the graphic novel with twelve Korean and French stories: escape to Korea for a while. Bon voyage. -Nicolas Finet, author, editor and journalist.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/88/9788496427488.jpg', 'title_long': 'Korea As Viewed By 12 Creators', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.35 Inches, Length: 6.63 Inches, Weight: 1.27647649698 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.63}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.27647649698}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.35}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2010-08-05', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga'], 'authors': ['Various Authors'], 'title': 'Korea As Viewed By 12 Creators', 'isbn13': '9788496427488', 'msrp': 15.6, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '849642748X', 'isbn10': '849642748X'}}
