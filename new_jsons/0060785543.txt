{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Emma sees naked people (not necessarily a bad thing!)<br/>Emma Hutch\'s upscale Manhattan clients call her the "Good Witch." Her uncanny telepathic abilities enable her to plant images into unsuspecting minds, which has made her New York\'s most successful professional matchmaker. After all, what bachelor, confirmed or otherwise, could deny his true destiny when the woman he can\'t seem to stop thinking about suddenly appears right in front of him? Now an all-too-perfect blonde socialite needs Emma\'s help to snare the most eligible single man in the city -- all in a day\'s work for the Good Witch.<br/>Except William Dearborn -- visual artist, software genius, total hunk, and dedicated hedonist -- is not so easily snared. And he\'s becoming a little too interested in the desperate matchmaking sorceress who\'s been following him all around town incognito. Emma doesn\'t have to be psychic to know what\'s going on in his mind. William\'s having very wicked thoughts indeed about the Good Witch . . . and Emma likes it! But she\'s got to resist his special brand of magic . . . or else her witchy career is going up in flames.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/43/9780060785543.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hex and the Single Girl', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.53 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.53}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2006-02-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'City Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Gothic', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Romantic'], 'authors': ['Valerie Frankel'], 'title': 'Hex and the Single Girl', 'isbn13': '9780060785543', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061841021'}, 'isbn': '0060785543', 'isbn10': '0060785543', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061841026', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
