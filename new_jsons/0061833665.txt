{'book': {'publisher': 'Katherine Tegen Books', 'synopsis': 'Twelve-year-old Mack MacAvoy suffers from a serious case of mediumness. Medium looks. Medium grades. Medium parents who barely notice him. With a list of phobias that could make anyone crazy, Mack never would have guessed that he is destined for a more-than-medium life.<br/>And then, one day, something incredibly strange happens to Mack. A three-thousand-year-old man named Grimluk appears in the boys’ bathroom to deliver some startling news: Mack is one of the Magnificent Twelve, called the Magnifica in ancient times, whatever that means. An evil force is on its way, and it’s up to Mack to track down eleven other twelve-year-olds in order to stop it. He must travel across the world to battle the wicked Pale Queen’s dangerous daughter, Ereskigal—also known as Risky. But Risky sounds a little scary, and Mack doesn’t want to be a hero. Will he answer the call?<br/>A laugh-out-loud story filled with excitement and magic, The Magnificent Twelve: The Call is the first book in bestselling author Michael Grant’s hilarious new fantasy adventure series.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/63/9780061833663.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Magnificent 12: The Call (Magnificent 12, 1)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 1 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 5.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.3}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2010-08-24', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Action & Adventure', 'Humor', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Michael Grant'], 'title': 'The Magnificent 12: The Call (Magnificent 12, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061833663', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061833665', 'isbn10': '0061833665'}}
