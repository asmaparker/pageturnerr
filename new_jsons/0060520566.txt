{'book': {'publisher': 'Katherine Tegen Books', 'synopsis': "Bethel, Alaska -- a small community in a stark landscape where a powerful and richly textured story spins together, one voice at a time. It is the late 1960s as beaten teenaged Dove Alexie sits in prison. One day, Dove suddenly vanishes, and there is nothing in the prison records to mark his arrival or departure. Out of the tundra, four young people step forward with their stories:<br/>Lorraine Hobbs, a precocious loner who brings meals to the prison;<br/>Annette Weinland, the local minister's daughter, who volunteers at the prison;<br/>Thelma Cooke and Edgar Kwagley, two Yup'ik adolescents orphaned and displaced from their native communities.<br/>At the core of each narration is Dove -- and the mystery of his disappearance.Like planets in the solar system, these four young people travel in separate orbits with an unseen companion, Dove. Denise Gosliner Orenstein's masterpiece of intertwining voices captures the complexities of human existence with humor and insight.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/64/9780060520564.jpg', 'title_long': 'Unseen Companion', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.12 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Width: 1.27 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.27}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.12}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2003-09-16', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues'], 'authors': ['Denise Gosliner Orenstein'], 'title': 'Unseen Companion', 'isbn13': '9780060520564', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060520566', 'isbn10': '0060520566'}}
