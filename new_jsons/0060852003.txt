{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Lizzie Nichols is back, pounding the New York City pavement and looking for a job, a place to live, and her proper place in the universe (not necessarily in that order).<br/>When "Summer Fling" Luke uses the L word (Living Together), Lizzie is only too happy to give up her plan of being postgrad roomies with best friend, Shari, in a one-room walk-up in exchange for cohabitation with the love of her life in his mother\'s Fifth Avenue pied-à-terre, complete with doorman and resident Renoir.<br/>But Lizzie\'s not as lucky in her employment search. As Shari finds the perfect job, Lizzie struggles through one humiliating interview after another, being judged overqualified for the jobs in her chosen field—vintage-gown rehab—and underqualified for everything else. It\'s Shari\'s boyfriend Chaz to the rescue when he recommends Lizzie for a receptionist\'s position at his father\'s posh law firm. The nonpaying gig at a local wedding-gown shop Lizzie manages to land all on her own.<br/>But Lizzie\'s notoriously big mouth begins to get her into trouble at work and at home almost at once—first at the law firm, where she becomes too chummy with Jill Higgins, a New York society bride with a troublesome future mother-in-law, and then back on Fifth Avenue, when she makes the mistake of bringing up the M word (Marriage) with commitment-shy Luke.<br/>Soon Lizzie finds herself jobless as well as homeless all over again. Can Lizzie save herself—and the hapless Jill—and find career security (not to mention a mutually satisfying committed relationship) at last?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/09/9780060852009.jpg', 'title_long': 'Queen of Babble in the Big City (Queen of Babble, 2)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.05}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2007-06-26', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Romance', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Meg Cabot'], 'title': 'Queen of Babble in the Big City (Queen of Babble, 2)', 'isbn13': '9780060852009', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060852003', 'isbn10': '0060852003'}}
