{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Nobody wants to raise a brat...but the surest way to do so is by doing too much for and giving too much to your kids.<br/>Parents often inadvertently confuse love with overindulgence. They don't want their children to suffer a moment of frustration or be deprived of any desire. But in truth, a balance of frustration tolerance and gratification is necessary to become a resilient and responsible adult.<br/>Of course, every child is difficult on occasion, but true brats are constantly selfish, demanding, and incapable of listening. Their parents must regularly plead, cajole, and bargain with them to exert some control. So what makes a child become a brat in the first place? And what can a parent do--or not do--to keep their children from becoming brats?<br/>Since being a mother is her most important role, renowned actress Marilu Henner has often turned to Dr. Ruth Sharon, a highly respected psychoanalyst, for advice on raising her own children. Together, in I Refuse to Raise a Brat, they have created a practical and accessible guidebook based on Dr. Sharon's fundamental observation: Adults with the greatest emotional difficulties were generally overgratified, overprotected, and overindulged as children.<br/>Consequently, parents need to allow their children to work through their frustrations at an early age and not consistently indulge them. I Refuse to Raise a Brat will show parents how to:<br/>Establish parent--child contracts and effective methods of discipline<br/>Handle temper tantrums, bedtime issues, sibling rivalry, lying, and more<br/>Help their children tolerate frustration and become comfortable with difficult feelings<br/>Filled with dozens of real-life questions, practical advice, and humorous anecdotes, I Refuse to Raise a Brat is a witty and uniquely helpful resource to help parents raise secure and self-reliant children.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/66/9780060392666.jpg', 'title_long': 'I Refuse to Raise a Brat: Straightforward Advice on Parenting in an Age of Overindulgence', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1999-10-06', 'subjects': ['Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Home Improvement & Design', 'How-to & Home Improvements', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting'], 'authors': ['Marilu Henner', 'Ruth Velikovsky Sharon'], 'title': 'I Refuse to Raise a Brat: Straightforward Advice on Parenting in an Age of Overindulgence', 'isbn13': '9780060392666', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060392665', 'isbn10': '0060392665'}}
