{'book': {'publisher': 'Harpercollins', 'synopsis': 'From Library Journal This is a good overview of how retail services function, written by Shilling and Horowitz, host of the TV program Fight Back: With David Horowitz and consumer reporter for The Today Show . Businesses are examined within subject areas; e.g., "Home Sweet Home" groups together real estate developers, brokers, title companies, and utilities. Financial and operational strategies and "tricks of the trade" are discussed, and a list of main players is provided. Other information includes statistics (unfortunately most are from 1982), lists of trade associations and journals, and consumer hints, where appropriate. This could be of general assistance to job seekers as well as the general consumer and would be especially useful for smaller libraries lacking original source materials. - Michael D.
