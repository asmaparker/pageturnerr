In six chapters dealing with the universal and the particular aspects of Islam, the Qur'an, the Prophet and the Prophetic tradition, the 'Shari'a', Sufism, and Shi'ism, Seyyed Hossein Nasr outlines the essential aspects of the Islamic beliefs, making frequent references to other religions in general and Christianity in particular. Drawing mainly on the Qur'an and the 'hadith', but also on the works of some contemporary Western scholars, the author presents the Islamic spiritual and intellectual tradition in the light of contemporary modern thought.
