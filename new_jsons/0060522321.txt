{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "The relentless crescendo of revelations of sexual abuse in the nation's Catholic churches has rocked the nation. Just how widespread is child sexual abuse by the Catholic clergy? And why hasn't the Catholic church done more to stop it?<br/>In A Gospel of Shame, Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalists Elinor Burkett and Frank Bruni provide the answers to these questions and more. The answers, however, turn out to be infuriating and heartbreaking, difficult to accept but impossible to dismiss. The authors thoroughly document dozens of cases across the country and reveal how this heinous abuse of trust has been tacitly sanctioned by the Church's silence.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/22/9780060522322.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Gospel of Shame: Children, Sexual Abuse, and the Catholic Church', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2002-06', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Catholicism', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Frank Bruni', 'Elinor Burkett'], 'title': 'A Gospel of Shame: Children, Sexual Abuse, and the Catholic Church', 'isbn13': '9780060522322', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060522321', 'isbn10': '0060522321'}}
