{'book': {'publisher': 'Organization for Economic', 'synopsis': "<p>Russia has several sources of energy, oil, gas and coal as well as wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass and solar energy - the resources of renewable energy. At the moment it is the fossil fuels that dominate Russia's energy sources whilst the renewable sources are little used. Russia's renewables can cost-effectively provide energy services where conventional forms are expensive. Established renewable technologies can cost effectively supplement energy from fossil fuels. Whilst new renewables like wind and solar energy can serve remote populations and in the right circumstances provide energy at competitive prices on the grid.</p>", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/47/9789264105447.jpg', 'title_long': 'Renewables in Russia: From Opportunity to Reality', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.10231131 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.10231131}}, 'pages': 120, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Business & Money'], 'authors': ['Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development'], 'title': 'Renewables in Russia: From Opportunity to Reality', 'isbn13': '9789264105447', 'msrp': 100, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9264105441', 'isbn10': '9264105441'}}
