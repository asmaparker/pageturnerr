{'book': {'publisher': 'HarTorch', 'synopsis': "Aiden Page's second life began on America's worst day . . .<br/>The most horrific terrorist attack in history enabled him to walk away from his failing business, his crumbling marriage, and an impending Justice Department investigation—and to start over in a South Pacific paradise. But in a moment of weakness, a one-word phone call to his teenage daughter Morgan causes ever-widening ripples in once-placid waters.<br/>Morgan now knows her father is alive and will stop at nothing to find him, embarking on a harrowing solo ocean voyage that will place her at the mercy of hostile seas and even more dangerous men. The hungry wolves hunting for Aiden Page have picked up the scent again, and if the death of a courageous young girl is the price for finding him, so be it. Because suddenly there's much more at stake than silencing a fugitive—and thousands of lives will depend on the action of a dead man.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/06/9780060081706.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ripple Effect, The', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 420, 'date_published': '2004-11-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors': ['Paul Garrison'], 'title': 'Ripple Effect, The', 'isbn13': '9780060081706', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060081708', 'isbn10': '0060081708'}}
