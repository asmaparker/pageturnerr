{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'So says Mancow Muller, the creator, writer, and ringmaster of Mancow\'s Morning Madhouse, which has been called the "funniest, fastest-moving, and most diverse show in radio history." In this book -- his first humble masterpiece -- Mancow rushes headlong through Europe, America, and even Cuba in a travel adventure that cross-dresses as a memoir.<br/>When Mancow loses his dad -- his number one fan -- to cancer, he has a meltdown that takes him spiraling down Freedom Road. Thrust on a nonstop international death ride that pulls him through his past, he races the autobahn at breakneck speeds, inhales Amsterdam\'s pleasures, narrowly escapes an illegal visit to Castro\'s Cuba, suffers a near-fatal nervous breakdown, and cavorts under dog piles of women. Along the way, Mancow questions everything: "Do we already live in a police state?" "Must individual spirit be crushed?" "What does it mean to be a member of The Dead Dad\'s Club?" "Do you want to get laid?"<br/>A combination of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Don Quixote (but with more sex), Dad, Dames, Demons, and a Dwarf takes you on a journey that will kindle your independent spirit and knock you to the floor with laughter.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/78/9780060728878.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dad, Dames, Demons, and a Dwarf: My Trip Down Freedom Road', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 inches, Weight: 1.04940036712 Pounds, Width: 0.720721 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.720721}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04940036712}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2004-06-15', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Mancow Muller', 'John Calkins'], 'title': 'Dad, Dames, Demons, and a Dwarf: My Trip Down Freedom Road', 'isbn13': '9780060728878', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060728876', 'isbn10': '0060728876'}}
