{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': '“Great talent, great imagination, and real been-there done-that authenticity.”<br/>—Lee Child<br/>“Not since Fleming charged Bond with the safety of the world has the international secret agent mystique been so anchored with an insider’s reality.”<br/>—Noah Boyd, author of The Bricklayer and Agent X<br/>Matthew Dunn knows his spycraft—and he proves it once again in Sentinel, his second electrifying Spycatcher novel. A former British M16 field officer trained in all aspects of intelligence collection, small-arms and explosives, military unarmed combat, and more, Dunn has an addition talent most other spies lack: he can really write! In Sentinel, Dunn brings back Agent Will Cochrane—whom Kirkus Reviews calls, “a Nietzschean hero who looks poised to give Lee Child’s Jack Reacher a run for his readers”—and sends him to Avacha Bay in eastern Russia, where he must infiltrate a top-secret submarine base, decode a cryptic message from a deep undercover operative, and quite possibly prevent a devastating war. Espionage fiction fans who regularly devour the works of Daniel Silva, Robert Ludlum, Alex Berenson, Ted Bell, Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, and Barry Eisler will discover there’s a new ace on the international thriller scene.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/23/9780062037923.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sentinel: A Will Cochrane Novel (Spycatcher, 2)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2012-08-07', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Military'], 'authors': ['Matthew Dunn'], 'title': 'Sentinel: A Will Cochrane Novel (Spycatcher, 2)', 'isbn13': '9780062037923', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0062037927', 'isbn10': '0062037927'}}
