{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt, Rinehart and Winston', 'synopsis': 'This is a reprint of the famous book, “The Big Player”, mentioned on the History Channel and news reports showing how a team of blackjack players made millions of dollars at the expense of Las Vegas Casinos. The original book accurately explained what Ken Uston and his teams did, but it did not explain exactly how they did it. Thus, the reader of the original book learned little or nothing about how to replicate the experiences of his teams. Now that Ken is no longer with us, one of the surviving members of his teams reveals for the first time herein exactly how Ken Uston was able to accomplish what he did, including the exact card counting methods used, which are NOT the methods described in “Beat the Dealer”, how Ken Uston and his teams managed to avoid detection, the pitfalls and problems they encountered in the casinos and why the team eventually broke up The original book has been updated with technical information by team member Roy Hoppe explaining how the team and card counting systems worked. Roy Hoppe is a rated chess master and a professional bridge player. He was a professional blackjack player until he "retired" from the game for reasons explained in this book.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/12/9780030169212.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Big Player: How a Team of Blackjack Players Made a Million Dollars', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}}, 'pages': 217, 'date_published': '1977', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Puzzles & Games', 'Blackjack'], 'authors': ['Ken & Roger Rapoport Uston'], 'title': 'The Big Player: How a Team of Blackjack Players Made a Million Dollars', 'isbn13': '9780030169212', 'msrp': 85.73, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0030169216', 'isbn10': '0030169216'}}
