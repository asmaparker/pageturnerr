{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': '“Santlofer’s fluid, almost poetic, writing, coupled with his extraordinary artwork, places him at the forefront of cutting-edge crime fiction.”<br/>—Chicago Tribune<br/><br/>Jonathan Santlofer has brilliantly reinvented the crime novel, and he returns with his most gripping and astonishing suspense novel to date: The Murder Notebook. An acclaimed visual artist whose numerous awards include two National Endowment for the Arts painting grants—and whose work has been reviewed in The New York Times, Art in America, and Artforum, among other publications—Santlofer combines gripping tales of murder and detection with stunning artwork that enhances and is integral to the story. In The Murder Notebook he brings back NYPD forensic sketch artist Nate Rodriguez, hero of Santlofer’s critically acclaimed thriller Anatomy of Fear, to unravel a gruesomely tangled thread of apparent murder-suicides in New York City.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/44/9780060882044.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Murder Notebook: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.55 Pounds, Width: 1.36 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.36}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2008-06-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Women Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Jonathan Santlofer'], 'title': 'The Murder Notebook: A Novel of Suspense', 'isbn13': '9780060882044', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060882042', 'isbn10': '0060882042'}}
