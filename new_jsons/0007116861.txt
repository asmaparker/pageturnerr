{'book': {'publisher': 'Flamingo', 'synopsis': "First published in 1970 and widely regarded as a prophetic masterpiece, this is a groundbreaking experimental novel by the acclaimed author of 'Crash' and 'Super-Cannes', who has supplied explanatory notes for this new edition. The irrational, all-pervading violence of the modern world is the subject of this extraordinary tour de force. The central character's dreams are haunted by images of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, dead astronauts and car-crash victims as he traverses the screaming wastes of nervous breakdown. Seeking his sanity, he casts himself in a number of roles: H-bomber pilot, presidential assassin, crash victim, pscyhopath. Finally, through the black, perverse magic of violence he transcends his psychic turmoils to find the key to a bizarre new sexuality.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/67/9780007116867.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Atrocity Exhibition', 'edition': '60064th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.76 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.52}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.440924524}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.76}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary', 'Science & Math'], 'authors': ['J G Ballard'], 'title': 'The Atrocity Exhibition', 'isbn13': '9780007116867', 'msrp': 5.69, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0007116861', 'isbn10': '0007116861'}}
