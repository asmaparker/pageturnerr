{'book': {'publisher': 'Harcourt College Pub', 'synopsis': 'Taking a more interdisciplinary approach to economics than most other texts, this new title provides more discussion of how economics relates to major social and political issues and includes a real-life flavour. The author takes an applied-price theory approach to microeconomics and a more modern neo-classical approach to macroeconomics. The text\'s reader-friendly organization separates main points from explanations and examples, enhancing student understanding and helping students review chapters with less study time. * Stockman\'s new title focuses on today\'s economic framework allowing an understanding of current economic conditions by providing a truly balanced approach. * This textbook focuses on long-run macroeconomics issues prior to the short run. By examining long-term economic growth, issues of productivity, development of technology, and long-term business cycles, Stockman introduces the student to macroeconomic models that reflect current economic, social, and political realities. * Taking a "seeing economics/using economics" approach to presenting the core concepts, Stockman\'s "applications-oriented" method incorporates detailed examples, and critical analysis to aid student\'s understanding. * Basic supply and demand is not only used to introduce microeconomics, it also provides the foundation for the core macroeconomic material. This effectively postpones Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply, which can prove to be overly complex to many students at this juncture, until they are better prepared to grasp this material. * The use of supply and demand for loans to study equilibrium macroeconomics demonstrates the importance of intertemporal choice and real interest rates as a price that allocates resources. This is another example of incorporating micro foundations into the presentation of macroeconomics.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/38/9780030311338.jpg', 'title_long': 'Introduction to Macroeconomics', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 2.58602233326 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.58602233326}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 604, 'date_published': '1995', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Microeconomics', 'Finance', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Alan C.
