{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Suited for a first course in applied probability and statistics for engineering or science majors, this is a superior textbook. Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, Second Edition, includes expanded coverage of quality control, and offers unique software that automates the computations required for exercises, as well as illustrating the main concepts of probability. The author emphasizes the manner in which probability yields insight into statistical problems; ultimately resulting in an intuitive understanding of the statistical procedures most often used by practicing engineers and scientists. Real data sets are incorporated in a wide variety of exercises and examples throughout the book, and this emphasis on data motivates the probability coverage.<br/><br/>* Very clear presentation of concepts<br/>* Clear presentation of probability<br/>* Contains many data sets<br/>* Presents mathematics that is both precise and easily understood<br/>* Includes an introductory chapter on descriptive statistics<br/>* Includes a computer disk that can be used to determine p-values and to illustrate concepts such as the central limit theorem<br/>New to the Second Edition:<br/>* Real-data examples and exercises throughout the text<br/>* Expanded coverage of Quality Control material<br/>* Unique software to automate the computations required for the exercises', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/20/9780125984720.jpg', 'title_long': 'Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, Second Edition', 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 2.62129629518 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.62129629518}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 578, 'date_published': '1999-10-25', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Applied', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Sheldon M.
