It covers a range of practical issues, from choosing your baby's doctor to dealing with sleep problems, from bolstering a child's self-esteem to helping a child manage school difficulties, from selecting age-appropriate toys to helping your child cope with divorce, death, or other circumstances disrupting family life.<br/>Your Child also moves beyond the day-to-day quandaries and concerns to those that represent more serious obstacles to a child's development and family life.
