{'book': {'publisher': 'Unwin Hyman', 'synopsis': '(Most Western research on Soviet labor-management relations has emphasized the forces of change and modernity over those of continuity of the past. In sharp contrast to this approach. Bruno Grancelli argues that the influence of traditional patterns of interaction between labor and management overrides the impact of modernization on the day-to-day functioning of Soviet industry. The first part of the book provides a historical overview of labor-management relations in Tsarist Russia and under Stalin. The second part examines the official model of Soviet industrial relations, emphasizing the primary legal and social policy measures employed to cope with two fundamental problems: lack of work discipline and illegal behavior. Finally, the operational reality of labor-management relations is discussed.<br/>The book draws largely from internal Soviet emigre sources, thus providing an inside look at less visible aspects of Soviet management and labor relations. It will therefore be of interest to both Soviet specialists and those concerned more generally with comparative labor-management relations, industrial relations, and organizational behavior)', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/08/9780044970408.jpg', 'title_long': 'Soviet Management and Labor Relations', 'edition': 1, 'dimensions': 'weight: 454 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 454}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '1988', 'subjects': ['Business & Money'], 'authors': ['Bruno Grancelli'], 'title': 'Soviet Management and Labor Relations', 'isbn13': '9780044970408', 'msrp': 47.95, 'binding': 'hardcover', 'isbn': '0044970404', 'isbn10': '0044970404'}}
