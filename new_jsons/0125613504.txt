{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Chemical Evolution of the Giant Planets is a compilation of papers on the chemical evolution of giant planets, presented at a colloquium sponsored by the Laboratory of Chemical Evolution in October, 1974. The compendium focuses on the interpretation of data provided by the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions, which conducted explorations of the outer planets. Scientists from various disciplines tackle the various aspects of the study of the chemical environment of the giant planets and their satellites. Subjects such as the atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn; chemical abundances in the atmospheres of the giant planets and their satellites; possibility of growth of airborne microbes in outer planetary atmospheres; and the biology on the outer planets are covered in the book. Astronomers, chemists, geologists, and biologists will find the book interesting.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/07/9780125613507.jpg', 'title_long': 'Chemical evolution of the giant planets', 'edition': 'First Printed', 'dimensions': 'xi, 240 p. : ill. ; 24 cm.', 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '1976', 'subjects': ['Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Cyril Ponnamperuma', 'College Park University of Maryland'], 'title': 'Chemical evolution of the giant planets', 'isbn13': '9780125613507', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0125613504', 'isbn10': '0125613504'}}
