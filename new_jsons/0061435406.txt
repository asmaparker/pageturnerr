The truth is, these three things—your weight, mood, and your sex life—are crucial elements of a great life at any age, but especially now that you're in the best years of your life. And they are the three elements that, when improperly calibrated, can cause a perfect storm. Face it: Your hormones, metabolism, blood flow, and mood aren't what they used to be. What you need is a Great Life Makeover.<br/>The Great Life Makeover does for your mind, body, and love life what a beauty makeover does for your appearance. And Dr. Daniel A. Monti and Dr. Anthony J. Bazzan are the experts who perform these makeovers. Dr. Monti, a specialist in psychiatry and couples' counseling, and Dr. Bazzan, a specialist in aging and hormones, lay out a practical, comprehensive, and detailed guide for midlife couples wanting to reboot their love life, rebalance hormones, and remedy the mental and physical issues that make midlife more difficult than it should be.<br/>Addressing the three hot-button issues with a focus on diet, fitness, and stress reduction, The Great Life Makeover offers a program that can dramatically improve your health, relationship, and overall quality of life and prevent other problems from cropping up in the future.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/09/9780061435409.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Great Life Makeover: Weight, Mood, and Sex', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.12 Inches, Length: 7.38 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.38}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.93}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.12}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2008-12-09', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Love & Romance', 'Marriage', 'Sex', 'Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Special Diet', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Aging', 'Sexual Health', 'General', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology'], 'authors': ['Daniel Monti M.D.', 'Anthony Bazzan M.D.'], 'title': 'The Great Life Makeover: Weight, Mood, and Sex', 'isbn13': '9780061435409', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061979449'}, 'isbn': '0061435406', 'isbn10': '0061435406', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061979446', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
