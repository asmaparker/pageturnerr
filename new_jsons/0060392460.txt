{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Cookbooks', 'synopsis': 'When we think of an inheritance, thoughts of money or some jewel-encrusted heirloom usually spring to mind. Well, Linda Fisher\'s inheritance did get her out of financial trouble, but it was nothing more than one of her mother\'s recipes and the values with which she was raised.<br/>Suddenly finding herself divorced and struggling to support her son and make ends meet, Linda, rather than ask for public assistance, vowed to take care of her own. She dug up her mother\'s pancake recipe and modified it into a muffin batter. Then she loaded up her red Radio Flyer wagon and hit the pavements of Westminster, Maryland, selling mouthwateringly delicious muffins -- blueberry, peach cobbler, black bottom, burnt sugar, apple dumpling, to name just a few -- and soon became a local favorite, known around town as "the Muffin Lady."<br/>Just when business started booming, however, the Carroll County Health Department told her to pack up her wagon because she didn\'t have a "department-approved commercial kitchen." Well, Linda wasn\'t going to take that lying down! She fought back, and the whole community came out to support her. Finally the Westminster Volunteer Fire Department offered her the use of their state-approved kitchen, where she still bakes muffins today.<br/>In The Muffin Lady, Linda shares the legacy of riches that was handed down by her mother. These gifts are useful both inside and outside the kitchen -- recipes whose ingredients include sugar, flour, perseverance and pride.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/68/9780060392468.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Muffin Lady: Muffins, Cupcakes, and Quickbreads for the Happy Soul', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1997-11-25', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Baking', 'Bread', 'Biscuits, Muffins & Scones'], 'authors': ['Linda Fisher'], 'title': 'The Muffin Lady: Muffins, Cupcakes, and Quickbreads for the Happy Soul', 'isbn13': '9780060392468', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060392460', 'isbn10': '0060392460'}}
