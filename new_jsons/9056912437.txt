{'book': {'publisher': 'New In Chess', 'synopsis': 'Charles Hertan, an experienced chess coach from Massachusetts, has made an astonishing discovery: the failure to consider key winning moves is often due to human bias, since your brain tends to disregard many winning moves because they are counter-intuitive or look unnatural. Charles Hertan?s radically different approach is: use COMPUTER EYES and always look for the most forcing move first! By studying forcing sequences according to Hertan?s method you will develop analytical precision, improve your tactical vision, overcome human bias and staleness, and enjoy the calculation of difficult positions. By recognizing moves that matter, you will win more games!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/37/9789056912437.jpg', 'title_long': 'Forcing Chess Moves: The Key to Better Calculation', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.34 Inches, Length: 6.86 Inches, Weight: 1.58071441854 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.86}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.94}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.58071441854}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.34}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2008-04-07', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Puzzles & Games', 'Chess'], 'authors': ['Charles Hertan'], 'title': 'Forcing Chess Moves: The Key to Better Calculation', 'isbn13': '9789056912437', 'msrp': 28.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9056912437', 'isbn10': '9056912437'}}
