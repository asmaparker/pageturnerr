{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "“Marilyn Yalom has written the rare book that illuminates something that always has been dimly perceived but never articulated, in this case that that the power of the chess queen reflects the evolution of female power in the western world.” —Cleveland Plain Dealer<br/><br/>Everyone knows that the queen is the most dominant piece in chess, but few people know that the game existed for five hundred years without her. It wasn't until chess became a popular pastime for European royals during the Middle Ages that the queen was born and was gradually empowered to become the king's fierce warrior and protector.<br/><br/>Birth of the Chess Queen examines the five centuries between the chess queen's timid emergence in the early days of the Holy Roman Empire to her elevation during the reign of Isabel of Castile. Marilyn Yalom, inspired by a handful of surviving medieval chess queens, traces their origin and spread from Spain, Italy, and Germany to France, England, Scandinavia, and Russia. In a lively and engaging historical investigation, Yalom draws parallels between the rise of the chess queen and the ascent of female sovereigns in Europe, presenting a layered, fascinating history of medieval courts and internal struggles for power.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/06/54/9780060090654.jpg', 'title_long': 'Birth of the Chess Queen: A History', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 0.72 Inches, Weight: 0.15 Pounds, Width: 5.31 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-04-26', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Puzzles & Games', 'Chess', 'History', 'Americas', 'South America', 'Europe', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', "Women's Studies"], 'authors': ['Marilyn Yalom'], 'title': 'Birth of the Chess Queen: A History', 'isbn13': '9780060090654', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0061913421', 'ePub': '0061913421'}, 'isbn': '0060090650', 'isbn10': '0060090650', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061913426', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
