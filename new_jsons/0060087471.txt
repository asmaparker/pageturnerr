{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperEntertainment', 'synopsis': "In this inspiring memoir, internationally beloved actress Jane Seymour shows how she has learned to embrace and learn from the many changes in her life.<br/>Now 50, Jane Seymour – the eternally beautiful star of Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman and countless other television shows and films – is a living testament to the rewards of embracing midlife and its challenges eagerly and gracefully. In Remarkable Changes, she leads the reader through the challenges of those years – from the physical changes that come with the territory to the emotional transformations that accompany this passage of life.<br/>From understanding the three stages of change, to making every moment significant, she helps us find the true value in our life transitions, from marriage and divorce to career changes to milestones in the lives of our parents and children. Whether we initiate change in our life or it is thrust upon us by circumstances beyond our control, Jane shows that we should stop 'dealing' with change and start actively incorporating it into our lives, using the hardwon wisdom we've all gained through the years.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/70/9780060087470.jpg', 'title_long': "Remarkable Changes: Turning Life's Challenges into Opportunities", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.0251495183 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.85}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.0251495183}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2003-04-15', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling'], 'authors': ['Jane Seymour'], 'title': "Remarkable Changes: Turning Life's Challenges into Opportunities", 'isbn13': '9780060087470', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060087471', 'isbn10': '0060087471'}}
