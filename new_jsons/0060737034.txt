But as things in Echo Falls keep getting curiouser and curiouser, Ingrid realizes she must solve the murder on her ownâ€”before it\'s too late.<br/>"Deft use of literary allusions and ironic humor add further touches of class to a topnotch mystery," said School Library Journal. "Intriguing twists." Publishers Weekly agreed: "The fresh dialogue and believable small-town setting will tempt fans to visit Echo Falls again."<br/>The next book in this Edgar Award-nominated series in Behind the Curtain, followed by Into the Dark.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/30/9780060737030.jpg', 'title_long': 'Down the Rabbit Hole (An Echo Falls Mystery)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.46 Pounds, Width: 1.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.46}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2006-04-25', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Arts, Music & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Mysteries & Detectives', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Peter Abrahams'], 'title': 'Down the Rabbit Hole (An Echo Falls Mystery)', 'isbn13': '9780060737030', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061891290'}, 'isbn': '0060737034', 'isbn10': '0060737034', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061891298', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
