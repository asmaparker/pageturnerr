{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTeen', 'synopsis': "Victoria<br/>Growing up in far-off India, wealthy young heiress Lady Victoria Arbuthnot was accustomed to handling her own affairs -- not to mention everyone else's. But in her sixteenth year, Vicky is unceremoniously shipped off to London to find a husband. With her usual aplomb, however, Lady Victoria gets herself engaged to the perfect English gentleman, even before setting foot on British soil.<br/>The Rogue<br/>Hugo Rothschild, ninth earl of Malfrey, is everything a girl could want in a future husband: he is handsome and worldly, if not rich. Lady Victoria has everything just as she'd like it. That is, if raffish young ship captain Jacob Carstairs would leave well enough alone.<br/>Jacob's meddling is nothing short of exasperating, and Victoria is mystified by his persistence. But when it becomes clear that young Lord Malfrey just might not be all that he's professed to be, Victoria is forced to admit, for the first time in her life, that she is wrong. Not only about her fiance, but about the reason behind the handsome ship captain's interference.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/14/9780060753214.jpg', 'title_long': 'Victoria and the Rogue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.27 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.62}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.27}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2004-12-28', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humorous', 'Historical Fiction', 'Europe', 'Romance', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Meg Cabot'], 'title': 'Victoria and the Rogue', 'isbn13': '9780060753214', 'msrp': 8.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061971855'}, 'isbn': '0060753218', 'isbn10': '0060753218', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061971853', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
