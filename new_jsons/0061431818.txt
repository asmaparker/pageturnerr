It's a perfect society, where everyone lives in harmony. Or so they say.<br/>There's me, the ghost in the glass, and there's everyone else on the warm side of the windows. If you're really quiet, you'll hear me creeping in the shadows.<br/>Someone else is starting over, too, running on a path perilously close to Kat and Tanka. Can the two girls and their friends uncover the dark secrets of the New Frontier before the unthinkable happens?<br/>The last birthday i ever had, years ago, was the one where I got shot instead of presents. i wasn't killed before and i won't get dead now. run, run as fast as i can, can't catch me 'cause i got a Plan!
