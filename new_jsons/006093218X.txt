Blindsided when his dazzling girlfriend dumps him, Johnny is wounded, stunned, and, most of all, clueless.<br/>You're like most men -- oblivious, says his friend Darlene. Her diagnosis: Johnny is doomed to be rejected by every woman he desires as long as he clings to his outmoded bachelor ways. Darlene puts him on a rigorous crash course to re-brand himself as husband material. But does Darlene really have his best interests at heart?
