{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "From the fire-hot author of Asking for Trouble comes a second irresistibly funny and romantic novel, in which we meet the delightfully wicked Harriet and John, who are matched as perfectly as scones and clotted cream -- if only Harriet would let herself indulge.<br/>Up to her eyeballs in her friends' dramas, Harriet Grey has no time for her own, let alone getting entangled with John Mackenzie. And though it's been ages since she's met one of the most gorgeous men London has to offer, it seems John's entangled with someone else. Or is he?<br/>Though they say all's fair in love, Harriet isn't about to complicate her life -- or risk her heart. But the persistent John seems to pop up everywhere she turns, and soon she's agreeing to meet him for a cocktail to repay a favor. After all, what harm can come out of one innocent little drink? Maybe a few breathtaking kisses, some suspiciously lingering embraces, and a wonderful weak-kneed dizziness that most definitely is not the flu. And that's before she finds herself all alone with John at Christmas. .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/48/9780060507848.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Promising Man (and About Time, Too)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.72 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.94}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.72}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2002-11-12', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'British & Irish', 'Humor & Satire', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Elizabeth Young'], 'title': 'A Promising Man (and About Time, Too)', 'isbn13': '9780060507848', 'msrp': 11.72, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060507845', 'isbn10': '0060507845'}}
