You'll find the perfect dish for each of your favorite celebrations: New Year's Day, the Fourth of July, Columbus Day, Passover, Easter, Memorial Day, Labor Day, President's Day, Hanukkah, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.<br/>The editors of American Profile have compiled the nation's most delicious recipes—straight from their readers—in this book, which is modeled after the magazine's most popular section, “Hometown Recipes.” You'll find everything from breakfast with Grandma's Christmas Casserole and Wake-Up Casserole to the perfect additions to jazz up your buffet, such as Julia's Fresh Cranberry Relish and Aunt Peggy's Salmon Pasta Salad, to sit-down dinner options such as Almost Lasagna Zucchini Casserole and Ben's Swiss Steak. Top it all off with a decadent dessert, such as Butter Rum Cake, or something a little easier, such as No-Roll Sugar Cookies or Quick-and-Easy Family Peanut Brittle, to create an experience that your family and friends will remember for years.<br/>American Profile, one of America's most widely circulated magazines, celebrates hometown life, and in Hometown Recipes for the Holidays editors Candace Floyd, Anne Gillem, Nancy S. Hughes, and Jill Melton do just that.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/96/9780061257896.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hometown Recipes for the Holidays', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.44 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.44}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2007-10-30', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Entertaining & Holidays', 'Christmas', 'Holidays', 'Comfort Food', 'Reference'], 'authors': ['American Profile', 'Candace Floyd', 'Jill Melton', 'Nancy Hughes', 'Anne Gillem'], 'title': 'Hometown Recipes for the Holidays', 'isbn13': '9780061257896', 'msrp': 18.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061877697'}, 'isbn': '0061257893', 'isbn10': '0061257893', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061877698', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
