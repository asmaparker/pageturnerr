{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "What does it mean when a fictional hero takes a journey? . Shares a meal? Gets drenched in a sudden rain shower? Often, there is much more going on in a novel or poem than is readily visible on the surface—a symbol, maybe, that remains elusive, or an unexpected twist on a character—and there's that sneaking suspicion that the deeper meaning of a literary text keeps escaping you.<br/>In this practical and amusing guide to literature, Thomas C. Foster shows how easy and gratifying it is to unlock those hidden truths, and to discover a world where a road leads to a quest; a shared meal may signify a communion; and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just rain. Ranging from major themes to literary models, narrative devices, and form, How to Read Literature Like a Professor is the perfect companion for making your reading experience more enriching, satisfying, and fun.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/27/9780060009427.jpg', 'title_long': 'How to Read Literature Like a Professor: A Lively and Entertaining Guide to Reading Between the Lines', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 inches, Length: 5.3125 inches, Weight: 0.54895103238 pounds, Width: 0.756757 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.756757}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.54895103238}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 314, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Books & Reading', 'Movements & Periods', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Thomas C.
