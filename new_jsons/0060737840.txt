They feasted on succulent rotisserie chickens from France, and banana-leaf-wrapped dishes from Mexico's Yucatán.

Then they came home and cooked and cooked until they had it right, so you can get it right.<br/>Whether it's hot little tapas, a serious steak, a juicy burger, flavorful fish, a pan full of paella, pizza or pasta topped with grilled vegetables, or chicken done to a turn, Cheryl and Bill will coach you to perfect results.
