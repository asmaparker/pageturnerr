{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Lily Tyler's very interested in her sexy new neighbor, private jet pilot Brady Cole. Brady could really go for smart, gorgeous Lily. The fire that's generated whenever they're together isn't just chemical . . . it's nuclear!But then there's Doug . . .<br/>The real ruler of the roost—Lily's noisy, nasty, match-mauling pooch—Doug likes to greet anyone he dislikes with yaps, nips, and very unpleasant surprises. And Doug does not like Brady. (Doug, in fact, doesn't like anybody—except Lily, of course. And, oddly enough, the squeaky clean, partner-track attorney whom Lily's domineering dad would love for his dutiful daughter to marry.)<br/>Brady's no canine fan to begin with—and Doug's the devil-dog incarnate! But Lily could never get serious with anyone who doesn't click with her precious puppy—so Brady's going to need a lot more than great looks, smooth charm, and hot passion to get himself out of the doghouse and into Lily's life!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/88/9780061175688.jpg', 'title_long': 'Beware of Doug', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2007-01-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'Science Fiction', 'Military', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Elaine Fox'], 'title': 'Beware of Doug', 'isbn13': '9780061175688', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061739014'}, 'isbn': '0061175684', 'isbn10': '0061175684', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061739019', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
