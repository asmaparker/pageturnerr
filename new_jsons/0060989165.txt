{'book': {'publisher': 'It Books', 'synopsis': 'Since age ten, Dave "Miracle Boy" Mirra has been defying gravity and changing people\'s minds about what can and can\'t be done on a bike. But in 1993 he lived up to his nickname in ways that his fans could never have anticipated. Six months after he was injured by a drunk driver and told by his doctors that he would never ride again, he was back on his bike, competing in -- and winning -- high-profile BMX events. Since then he has gone on to win more X Games medals than any other competitor --in any event -â€“ and has inspired a devoted following always hungry for a new miracle.<br/>Mirra Images captures all of Dave\'s most daring and explosive tricks -- carving flairs, wallride-to-tailwhips, and his record-setting nineteen-foot air -- in stunning color. In addition, Dave delves into his past and his personal photo album to shed light on his rise to the top of the action sports world and reveal a side of himself that has never before been seen. This action-packed photo-autobiography is the first ever look into the life, times, tricks, and bikes of the biggest of all BMX superstars.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/63/9780060989163.jpg', 'title_long': 'Mirra Images', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.12 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 1.3889122506 Pounds, Width: 0.52 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.52}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3889122506}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.12}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2003-09-30', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Biographies', 'Individual Sports', 'Cycling'], 'authors': ['Dave Mirra'], 'title': 'Mirra Images', 'isbn13': '9780060989163', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060989165', 'isbn10': '0060989165'}}
