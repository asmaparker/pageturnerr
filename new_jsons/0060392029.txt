{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'In the same tradition as Sisters and Simple Abundance, Pearls of Wisdom from Grandma explores the deep-rooted connections between grandmother and grandchild and the boundary between memory and experience. It shares with readers a timeless string of wisdom, warmth and wit from celebrities, political and business leaders, authors, children and others eager to reminisce about the profound effect their grandmothers had on their lives.<br/>With an introduction by Demi Moore, Pearls of Wisdom from Grandma is full of interesting personal stories and quotes from a multicultural swath of American society, from people like George and Barbara Bush, Alice Hoffman, Margaret Atwood, Edwidge Dandicott and Toni Braxton. The grandmother of noted fashion designer Vera Wang once told her: "Always eat before going out, because it\'s very unfeminine to eat like a horse." Writer Dawna Markova tells us how her grandmother taught her to look at a boy who was missing his legs and see the love and riches he possessed, more so than the elegant man in a fur coat standing next to him. "Feel what it is like to be him," her grandmother said. "Feel his heart. Now look at him again. Look at that heart. It\'s pure gold and wide as the sky. He\'s a rich old soul whose path is to teach all of us about joy."<br/>Together, these voices of love paint a heartfelt portrait of everything a grandmother can be: a healer, a guide and inspiration.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/24/9780060392024.jpg', 'title_long': 'Pearls of Wisdom from Grandma', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1997-09-05', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Worship & Devotion', 'Inspirational'], 'authors': ['Ed J.
