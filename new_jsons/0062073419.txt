Written in the inimitable Sheldon style and based on extensive, never before published material from his private archives, Sidney Sheldon’s Angel of the Dark is a thrilling tale of murder, lies, and lust that the master storyteller—the bestselling author of Master of the Game, The Other Side of Midnight, and so many other beloved classics—would have been proud to have called his own. With Sidney Sheldon’s Angel of the Dark, a gripping, stylish, sexy and surprising story of a son’s globe-hopping hunt for answers about his wealthy father’s brutal death, confirmed Sheldon fans have good reason to rejoice.
