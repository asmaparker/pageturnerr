Their backgrounds, personal styles, and political ideals may be as diverse as the nation they serve. Yet they share a commonality that runs deeper than politics or geography -- they desire to give a voice to all their constituents while serving as role models for women young and old.<br/>Once every month, these distinguished women for an informal dinner to share their knowledge, their hearts, and a good meal. Leaving behind partisanship and rhetoric, they discuss and debate the issues, both political and personal, affecting their lives.

Weaving together their individual stories of triumph, adversity, adaptability, and leadership, Nine and Counting gives voice to these charismatic women as never before, offering a rare, insider\'s glimpse into Washington and sending the powerful message that membership in the "world\'s most exclusive club" is open to every woman in America.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/63/9780060957063.jpg', 'title_long': 'Nine and Counting: The Women of the Senate', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.75 Inches, Length: 8.09 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 5.36 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.09}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.36}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2001-07-24', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'Politics & Social Sciences', "Women's Studies", 'Politics & Government', 'United States', 'Public Affairs & Policy'], 'authors': ['Barbara Boxer', 'Senator Susan Collins', 'Dianne Feinstein', 'The Girl Scouts USA', 'Catherine Whitney'], 'title': 'Nine and Counting: The Women of the Senate', 'isbn13': '9780060957063', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060957069', 'isbn10': '0060957069'}}
