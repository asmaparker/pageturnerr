{'book': {'publisher': 'Hephzibah Publishing House', 'synopsis': 'The Apostle Matthew is telling us that the Word of Jesus was spoken to everyone in this world, for he saw Jesus as the King of kings. Now, Christians throughout the world, who have just been born again by believing in the gospel of the water and the Spirit that we are spreading, are indeed yearning to feed on the bread of life. But it is difficult for them to have fellowship with us in the true gospel, for they are all far away from us. Therefore, to meet the spiritual needs of these people of Jesus Christ, the King of kings, the sermons in this book have been prepared as new bread of life for them to nourish their spiritual growth. The author proclaims that those who have received the remission of their sins by believing in the Word of Jesus Christ, the King of kings, must feed on His pure Word in order to defend their faith and sustain their spiritual lives. This book will provide the real spiritual bread of life to all of you who have become the royal people of the King by faith. Through His Church and servants, God will continue to provide you with this bread of life. May God`s blessings be on all of you who have been born again of water and the Spirit, who desire to have true spiritual fellowship with us in Jesus Christ.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/76/9788983143976.jpg', 'title_long': 'Spiritual Growth Series 1 -The Gospel of Matthew (I)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.2 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}}, 'pages': 346, 'date_published': '2003-10-26', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['Paul C.
