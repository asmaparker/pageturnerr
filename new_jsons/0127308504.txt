{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Biology of Halophytes is a monograph on the biological aspects of halophytes and their behavior under saline conditions. It explores the physioecological characteristics of halophytes, such as reproduction, growth, metabolism, water relations, mineral nutrition, salt transport, salt secretion, and salt resistance. It also provides ecological information on higher marine plants, particularly submerged angiosperms, mangroves, and high coast plants. Organized into 16 chapters, this volume begins with an overview of sources of salinity and the development and nature of salines and salt-affected soils. It proceeds with a discussion of the classification of halophytes, their mutual relationships, distribution, and sociology. It also summarizes autecological information on some terrestrial halophytes and introduces the reader to the formative effects of salinity, interrelationships between plants and spatial distribution within the community, ion transport and mineral nutrition, and regulation of salt content of shoots, before concluding with a short review on ecotypic differentiation in halophytes. This book will be a valuable resource for advanced students, as well as teachers of plant and environmental sciences.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/85/00/9780127308500.jpg', 'title_long': 'Biology of Halophytes', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Page Fidelity', 'pages': 410, 'date_published': '1972-01-15', 'subjects': ['Botany', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Botany'], 'authors': ['Yoav Waisel'], 'title': 'Biology of Halophytes', 'isbn13': '9780127308500', 'msrp': 72.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0127308504', 'isbn10': '0127308504', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780323151580', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
