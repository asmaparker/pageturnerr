{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': "When it comes to money, are you controlled by fear?<br/>Do you underestimate your worth?<br/>Are you ready to go to the next level, but can't seem to get there?<br/>If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may be an underearner. Underearners are self-saboteurs who don't live up to their earnings potential, says Barbara Stanny, a financial educator, motivational speaker, and career counselor. Whether they make $10 an hour or six figures a year, they tend to live paycheck to paycheck, are often in debt, and have a high tolerance for low pay. Ironically, many work incredibly hard. The good news is that underearning is a self-imposed condition. By focusing on overcoming it, underearners will not only earn what they deserve, but live a richer life. With techniques and exercises that have helped thousands of people, Stanny teaches five essential steps to financial independence and brings a message of empowerment to all those who chronically undervalue themselves.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/23/9780060818623.jpg', 'title_long': 'Overcoming Underearning(R): A Five-Step Plan to a Richer Life', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.42 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.54}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.42}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2007-11-20', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Motivational', 'Personal Transformation', 'Success', 'Business & Money', 'Business Culture', 'Motivation & Self-Improvement', 'Job Hunting & Careers', 'Guides', 'Management & Leadership', 'Personal Finance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Barbara Stanny'], 'title': 'Overcoming Underearning(R): A Five-Step Plan to a Richer Life', 'isbn13': '9780060818623', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0061856665', 'ePub': '0061856665'}, 'isbn': '006081862X', 'isbn10': '006081862X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061856662', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
