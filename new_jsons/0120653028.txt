{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press, 1981.', 'synopsis': 'Development of Psychobiological Perspectives, Volume 2, The Visual System, is the second of two-part series covering vision, audition, olfaction, taste, tactile sensitivity, and sensory-motor activity during ontogenesis. The focus is on approaches to perceptual development that incorporate a psychobiological perspective. The present volume brings together several topics of critical importance to the process of understanding the visual system. The book is organized into three parts. Part A addresses the theoretical and interpretive issues involved in designing and drawing conclusions from research on the development of the visual system. Part B on animal studies of visual development covers the neural and behavioral characteristics of the cat and monkey visual system during the early postnatal period. Part C examines visual development in human infants. Together, these three parts offer a comprehensive coverage of major issues in the structure and function of the developing mammalian visual system. Each chapter emphasizes the behavioral consequences of developing visual functions.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/27/9780120653027.jpg', 'title_long': 'Development of Perception.
