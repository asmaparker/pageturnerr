{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': "Acclaimed art consultant and style writer Barbara Guggenheim shows how she decorated a home using eBay, and provides all the information you need to create your own unique home.<br/>When art consultant Barbara Guggenheim took on the project of decorating a sample house for KB Home, a premier builder of home development, she wondered how she (or anyone else) could juggle the project with her full–time job and other daily duties. EBay offered the perfect solution–all–hours convenience and an easy and affordable tool for finding just the right thing–and some unexpected things, as well! The result was a fantastic four–bedroom home, completely decorated on a budget using eBay.<br/>This book follows Barbara on her personal journey, from looking for inspiration, to planning a concept for each room–from the Tiki Loft to the Adirondack–style guest room. It also shows how she navigated the pitfalls of eBay and learned to maximize its advantages, from search and bidding tips to transforming imperfect items. Filled with creative and practical ideas, Decorating on eBay is certain to appeal to the wide audience of young people on a budget–many of whom are already familiar with eBay. This lush four–color book will come alive through the glorious photographs of Jim McHugh of Architectural Digest, and through Barbara's warm, accessible, pithy tone, which will encourage readers everywhere that they, too, can achieve their dream home without the outrageous price tag.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/83/9780060762483.jpg', 'title_long': 'Decorating on eBay : Fast & Stylish on a Budget', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 2.16 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.16}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2005-11-01', 'subjects': ['Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Crafts & Hobbies', 'Decorating', 'Home Improvement & Design', 'Decorating & Design'], 'authors': ['Barbara Guggenheim'], 'title': 'Decorating on eBay : Fast & Stylish on a Budget', 'isbn13': '9780060762483', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060762489', 'isbn10': '0060762489'}}
