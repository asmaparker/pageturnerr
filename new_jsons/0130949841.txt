{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': 'This popular, culture-oriented book is devoted to teaching its readers how to “read” all kinds of texts. Its comprehensive and inclusive approach focuses on the relationship between absorbing traditional works—such as novels, short stories, and poems—and other less-traditional ones—such as movies, the Internet, art works, and television. More importantly, the book teaches learners the usefulness of actively reading their surroundings. Mastering these goals will help readers become successful as students in academic settings, and as participants in the world. An emphasis on accessible and critical works features a variety of reading levels that range from student written to theoretical works, with a large portion from magazines and newspapers. For anyone who loves to read—anything.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/44/9780130949844.jpg', 'title_long': 'The World Is a Text: Writing, Reading, and Thinking About Culture and its Contexts', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 1.5 Inches, Weight: 2.22005497834 Pounds, Width: 6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.22005497834}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 792, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Jonathan Silverman', 'Dean Rader'], 'title': 'The World Is a Text: Writing, Reading, and Thinking About Culture and its Contexts', 'isbn13': '9780130949844', 'msrp': 55.4, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0130949841', 'isbn10': '0130949841'}}
