{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'An indentured servant finds herself bound by law, society, and her own heart in this novel set in colonial Cape Cod from the author of acclaimed The Widow’s War.<br/>Indentured servant Alice Cole barely remembers when she was not “bound”, first to the Morton family, then to their daughter Nabby—her companion since childhood—when she wed. But Nabby’s new marriage is not happy, and when Alice finds herself torn between her new master and her old friend, she runs away to Boston. There she meets a sympathetic widow named Lyddie Berry and her lawyer companion, Eben Freeman. Impulsively stowing away on their ship to Satucket on Cape Cod, Alice finds employment making cloth with Lyddie. Yet as Alice soon discovers, freedom—as well as gratitude, friendship, and trust—has a price far higher than she ever imagined.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/56/9780061240256.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bound: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2008-04-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Small Town & Rural', 'Friendship', 'United States', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Sally Cabot Gunning'], 'title': 'Bound: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780061240256', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061240257', 'isbn10': '0061240257'}}
