{'book': {'publisher': 'Skira', 'synopsis': "In Weak and Widespread, modernity stands as a contrasting operative practice when compared to that of the 20th century, which was based on finding definitive solutions to old and new problems of industrial society. Today's architecture and urban planning tends to operate through reversible solutions, taking their references from models that are incomplete, imperfect and elastic. Precisely for this reason they are capable of withstanding the continuous processes of innovation. In this book Branzi examines how transformations in the concept of modernity have changed project strategy following new territorial and social developments. He puts this into relation to his own projects and research from the mid-1960's with the radical experience of the Archizoom group until the present.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/17/9788876246517.jpg', 'title_long': 'Weak and Diffuse Modernity: The World of Projects at the beginning of the 21st Century', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 8.3 Inches, Weight: 1.433004703 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.433004703}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2}}, 'pages': 180, 'date_published': '2006-11-07', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Architecture', 'Criticism', 'Drafting & Presentation', 'History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Weak and Diffuse Modernity: The World of Projects at the beginning of the 21st Century', 'isbn13': '9788876246517', 'msrp': 34.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '8876246517', 'isbn10': '8876246517'}}
