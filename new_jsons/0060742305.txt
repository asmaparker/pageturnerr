{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "A delightful Regency–era tale of an earl who always gets his way and the woman who is determined to resist his charms...by an exciting debut author!<br/>The Earl of Sinclair is fit to be tied! His servants have been pairing up and eloping, leaving the rest of his household staff referring to him as the matchmaking earl. His newest hire is his secretary Quincy.<br/>It isn't long before his insolent employee wraps the household staff around his finger, which Sinclair is willing to overlook, especially when he realises that the backside he finds himself constantly staring at is not that of a boy, but of a full–grown woman! Quincy never actually lied; she simply never said she wasn't a he.<br/>Desperate for employment, she dressed as any secretary would and let her employer make his own assumptions. Now if only she can keep her mind on her work instead of Sinclair's devilish charm, she just may stop herself from falling in love with him.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/00/9780060742300.jpg', 'title_long': 'What an Earl Wants', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-12-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Shirley Karr'], 'title': 'What an Earl Wants', 'isbn13': '9780060742300', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061931314'}, 'isbn': '0060742305', 'isbn10': '0060742305', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061931314', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
