{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': '"A celebration of simple, pure joy"* from Caldecott medalist Kevin Henkes. New York Times bestseller!<br/>Old Bear lumbers to his cave to hibernate till spring. In his dreams, he is a cub again, exploring the seasons—summer, fall, winter, and spring.<br/>When he finally awakes, Old Bear is so happy to find the outside world waiting for him, just as beautiful as in his dreams.<br/>“As in so many of Henkes’s books, nothing is superfluous. Every word, line, color choice, and composition feels essential and fits beautifully into a common theme.” (Booklist* starred review)<br/>“Henkes has created a thoroughly delightful character filled with curiosity and sweetness and placed him in a simple tale that unfolds with a natural, rhythmical pace. Old Bear will enrapture young listeners for years to come.” (School Library Journal starred review)<br/>“Lyrically describing the young-at-heart, Henkes plays an artist’s game of hot and cold watercolor hues.” (Publishers Weekly starred review)', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/69/9780061552069.jpg', 'title_long': 'Old Bear', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 10 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.37 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.37}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '2008-08-19', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Bears', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Science, Nature & How It Works', 'Nature', 'Recycling & Green Living', 'Early Learning', 'Basic Concepts'], 'authors': ['Kevin Henkes'], 'title': 'Old Bear', 'isbn13': '9780061552069', 'msrp': 18.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0061552062', 'isbn10': '0061552062'}}
