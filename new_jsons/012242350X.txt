{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Since the first edition of Biochemistry of Foods was published there have been a number of introductory texts in Food Chemistry/Biochemistry. This book is unique in that it approaches the subject in far more detail and from the in vivo perspective. In response to user comments, the second edition has added additional chapters, expanded its coverage, and incorporated major breakthroughs in food science knowledge, such as ethylene biosynthesis and non-enzymatic browning. No other test provides the reader with state-of-the-art information in this area in a concise, integrated form.Key Features* Expanded coverage and more recent findings incorporated in response to user comments* Incorporates latest research results in concise integrated form* Incorporates major breakthroughs in food science ethylene biosynthesis, non-enzymatic browning and cleaning enzymes for better use', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/35/05/9780122423505.jpg', 'title_long': 'Plant pigments, flavors, and textures: The chemistry and biochemistry of selected compounds (Food science and technology)', 'edition': 2, 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.25002102554 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.25002102554}}, 'pages': 219, 'date_published': '1979', 'subjects': ['Food Science', 'Biochemistry', 'Professional, Career & Trade -> Food Technology -> Food Science', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Biochemistry'], 'authors': ['N.
