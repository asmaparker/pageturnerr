{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': 'An essential career guide for every Asian American—and all their co-workers and managers—that explains how traditional Asian cultural values are at odds with Western corporate culture.<br/>Leading Asian American career coach and advocate Jane Hyun explains that the lack of Asian Americans in executive suite positions is brought about by a combination of Asian cultures and traditions strait-jacketing Asian Americans in the workplace, and how the group’s lack of vocal affirmation in popular media and culture, afflicts them with a “perpetual foreigner syndrome” in the eyes of Americans who don’t know enough to understand the challenges placed on Asian Americans in the corporate environment.<br/>Filled with anecdotes and case studies from her own consulting experience covering the gamut of Asian Americans from various backgrounds, the book discusses how being Asian affects the way they interact with colleagues, managers, and clients, and will offer advice and real world solutions while exposing the challenges encountered.<br/>For the Asian reader, the book will help them to see the cultural barriers they subconsciously place in their own career paths and how to overcome them. For the non-Asian reader, the book serves as a primer for promoting optimal working relationships with Asians, and will help start a dialogue that will benefit all.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/29/9780060731229.jpg', 'title_long': 'Breaking the Bamboo Ceiling: Career Strategies for Asians', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.67902376696 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.67902376696}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2006-04-11', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Success', 'Business & Money', 'Job Hunting & Careers', 'Guides', 'Job Hunting', 'Management & Leadership', 'Management', 'Human Resources', 'Human Resources & Personnel Management', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies'], 'authors': ['Jane Hyun'], 'title': 'Breaking the Bamboo Ceiling: Career Strategies for Asians', 'isbn13': '9780060731229', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0061983527', 'ePub': '0061983527'}, 'isbn': '0060731222', 'isbn10': '0060731222', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061983528', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
