{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'In gentle, compassionate language, The Needs of the Dying helps us through the last chapter of our lives. Author David Kessler has identified key areas of concern: the need to be treated as a living human being, the need for hope, the need to express emotions, the need to participate in care, the need for honesty, the need for spirituality, and the need to be free of physical pain. Examining the physical and emotional experiences of life-challenging illnesses, Kessler provides a vocabulary for communication with doctors, with hospital staff, and with each other, and-at a time when the right words are exceedingly difficult to find-he helps readers find a way to say good-bye. Using comforting and touching stories, including new accounts about Michael Landon and Anthony Perkins, he provides information to help us meet the needs of a loved one at this important time in our lives.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/13/9780060958213.jpg', 'title_long': "The Needs of the Dying: A Guide For Bringing Hope, Comfort, and Love to Life's Final Chapter", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.504505 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.504505}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2000-10-01', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Death & Grief', 'Grief & Bereavement', 'Relationships', 'Love & Loss'], 'authors': ['David Kessler'], 'title': "The Needs of the Dying: A Guide For Bringing Hope, Comfort, and Love to Life's Final Chapter", 'isbn13': '9780060958213', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060958219', 'isbn10': '0060958219'}}
