{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'A cultured city scarred by war.<br/>An eastern émigré with scars and secrets of<br/>her own. A young woman who claims to<br/>be a Russian grand duchess. A brazen killer,<br/>as vicious as he is clever. A detective<br/>driven by decency and the desire for justice.<br/>A political movement growing in power. . . .<br/>Deeply atmospheric, peopled with rich, complex characters, City of Shadows is an enthralling novel of historical suspense set in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s -- a decadent, turbulent time in which a proud nation scarred by defeat, deprivation, and debauchery will become the fertile breeding ground for the rise of National Socialism.<br/>Berlin, 1922 -- one of this troubled city\'s growing number of refugees, Esther Solomonova survives by working as secretary to her fellow Russian émigré, "Prince"Nick, a scheming adventurer and cabaret owner. Always on the prowl for a deal, Nick smells money when he hears of a woman in an asylum claiming to be a grand duchess, daughter of the Czar of all the Russias, who escaped the assassination of the rest of her family by the Bolsheviks. Enlisting a highly suspicious Esther, Nick plans to prepare the woman -- known as Anna Anderson -- to claim the Romanov fortune.<br/>But Anna is being hunted. Or so she claims. At first Esther believes Anna\'s fear to be just in her imagination -- until innocent people around them begin to die. So in a Berlin stricken by hyperinflation, Esther enlists the help of a German police officer -- a dogged inspector named Schmidt -- to try and find out who wants Anna dead -- and why. Yet the deeper she and Schmidt dig, the more they realize that their own lives are at risk.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/72/68/9780060817268.jpg', 'title_long': 'City of Shadows: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.6 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2006-05-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Ariana Franklin'], 'title': 'City of Shadows: A Novel of Suspense', 'isbn13': '9780060817268', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060817267', 'isbn10': '0060817267'}}
