But that was before he stopped talking to her and disappeared into a forest with a mysterious woman made of ice. Now it\'s up to Hazel to go in after him. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen\'s "The Snow Queen," Breadcrumbs is a stunningly original fairy tale of modern-day America, a dazzling ode to the power of fantasy, and a heartbreaking meditation on how growing up is as much a choice as it is something that happens to us.<br/>In Breadcrumbs, Anne Ursu tells, in her one-of-a-kind voice, a story that brings together fifty years of children\'s literature in a tale as modern as it is timeless. Hazel\'s journey to come to terms with her evolving friendship with Jack will deeply resonate with young readers.<br/>Supports the Common Core State Standards', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/51/9780062015051.jpg', 'title_long': 'Breadcrumbs', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.05}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 312, 'date_published': '2011-09-27', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Fairy Tales, Folk Tales & Myths', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Anne Ursu'], 'title': 'Breadcrumbs', 'isbn13': '9780062015051', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0062015052', 'isbn10': '0062015052'}}
