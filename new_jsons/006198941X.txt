Rarely, however, do the two meld as seamlessly and synergistically as Lisa Black.”<br/>—Sacramento Book Review<br/>“She is, quite simply, one of the best storytellers around.”<br/>—Tess Gerritsen<br/>A former forensic scientist with the Cleveland coroner’s office, Lisa Black knows the world she writes about, as she has proven in the past with her gripping thrillers featuring Theresa MacLean (Takeover, Evidence of Murder, Trail of Blood). With Defensive Wounds, Black delivers possibly her most sensational crime fiction masterwork to date—a stunning tale of forensic expert MacLean’s investigation into the brutal murder of a criminal defense attorney at a Cleveland convention that reveals the frightening presence of a serial killer prowling the city. The forensic police thriller remains one of the most popular sub-genres in contemporary mystery fiction, and Defensive Wounds once again proves that Lisa Black is one of the “big guns,” in the top tier alongside Patricia Cornwell, Kathy Reichs, Jefferson Bass, and Michael Connelly.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/14/9780061989414.jpg', 'title_long': 'Defensive Wounds: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.13}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2011-09-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Women Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Lisa Black'], 'title': 'Defensive Wounds: A Novel of Suspense', 'isbn13': '9780061989414', 'msrp': 24.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '006198941X', 'isbn10': '006198941X'}}
