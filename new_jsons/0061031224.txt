{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon Books', 'synopsis': "If Lily and Robert Brewster no longer have a penny to their names, at least they have a roof over their heads in this bleak Depression November of 1932 -- the sprawling estate of their late great-uncle in Voorburg-on-Hudson. But then a badly disguised stranger offers to pay generously to hold a very secret meeting there shortly before the national election. And soon one of the mystery guests is murdered in his bath, a local grade school teacher goes missing, and a little boy is kidnapped. With Pretty Boy Floyd rumored to be somewhere near, the nasty business smacks of underworld activity -- or possible political conspiracy aimed at sabotaging Roosevelt's election. Either way, Chief Howard Walker has nowhere to house all the suspects except at the local Hospital for the Criminally Insane. And the Brewster siblings are going to have their hands full tying the various ends together . . . and ferreting out the killer who abused their hospitality.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/29/9780061031229.jpg', 'title_long': 'Love for Sale (Grace & Favor Mysteries, No. 4)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2004-02-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jill Churchill'], 'title': 'Love for Sale (Grace & Favor Mysteries, No. 4)', 'isbn13': '9780061031229', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061031224', 'isbn10': '0061031224'}}
