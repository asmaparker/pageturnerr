A chilling tale of dark forces and revenge…<br/>The ghost turns up one summer day, alone in a world she once knew, among people who were once her family.

She can be sure of only one thing – that there's been an accident.<br/>As she struggles to find her identity, she becomes aware of a malevolent force stirring around her. Something terrible is about to happen. One of the sisters will die – unless the ghost can use the future to reshape the past.
