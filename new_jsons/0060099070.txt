Shockingly, the answer turns out to be "No." Unbeknown to him, at least until that point, his mother, a German Protestant, fell in love during World War II with a Russian Jew and bore his child. Anderson learns this information as a young man but he and his mother keep this secret for another 35 years, until the day Anderson—now an unusually successful publishing executive—meets an unknown brother who, it turns out, has lived a nearly parallel life. Meant To Be is a love story, a journey of self-discovery and spirituality, and a provocative challenge to common notions about the role of heredity in our lives.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/77/9780060099077.jpg', 'title_long': "Meant to Be: The True Story of a Son Who Discovers He Is His Mother's Deepest Secret", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.58}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2004-09-07', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Journalists', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Law', 'Intellectual Property', 'Specialties', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Books & Reading', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Publishing & Books', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'General', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Communication & Media Studies', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Walter Anderson'], 'title': "Meant to Be: The True Story of a Son Who Discovers He Is His Mother's Deepest Secret", 'isbn13': '9780060099077', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061865583'}, 'isbn': '0060099070', 'isbn10': '0060099070', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061865589', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
