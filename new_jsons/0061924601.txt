{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'When television viewing audiences first met Ruby Gettinger, a mild-mannered, sweet-natured, Southern-food addicted Sunday school teacher, her weight was hovering near 500 pounds. As the ad campaign for the show says, Ruby doesn′t know how she got to this weight, but she knows its killing her. Having been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and told by doctors that she would die if she continued to carry all that weight, Ruby is changing her life to save it. Her honesty, optimism and genuine commitment to uncover all the underlying causes of her addiction--mental, physical and emotional--are inspiring millions of others in the process. So too is her progress. (She′s now down to 360 pounds!)<br/>While Style′s cameras have been following Ruby′s personal journey as she sheds the weight, gets healthier, battles discrimination daily, and struggles to recover lost childhood memories, these excerpts, taken from the journal Ruby carries with her everywhere on the show, include her most intimate reflections, insights and discoveries regarding her life "before" and "during" this incredibly transformative experience. It also includes her fears, hopes and dreams for life after her goal is realized. In addition, the book will feature thoughts from the doctors, dieticians, trainers, therapists, friends and family supporting Ruby′s mission. Everyone following and touched by Ruby′s story will want to read this book.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/06/9780061924606.jpg', 'title_long': "Ruby's Diary: Reflections on All I've Lost and Gained", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.73}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2009-09-08', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Eating Disorders & Body Image', 'Motivational', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'Memoirs', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Diets & Weight Loss', 'Weight Loss', 'Diseases & Physical Ailments', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Ruby Gettinger'], 'title': "Ruby's Diary: Reflections on All I've Lost and Gained", 'isbn13': '9780061924606', 'msrp': 21.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '006198597X'}, 'isbn': '0061924601', 'isbn10': '0061924601', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061985973', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
