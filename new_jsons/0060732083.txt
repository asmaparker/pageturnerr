{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Controversy rages about capital punishment as innocent men and women are being released from death rows all over the country. Are innocent people being executed? Is capital punishment justice or is it revenge?<br/>Into the debate steps Mark Fuhrman, America\'s most famous detective, and no stranger to controversy himself.<br/>Fuhrman seeks to answer these questions by investigating the death penalty in Oklahoma, where a "hang \'em high" attitude of cowboy justice resulted in twentyâ€“one executions in 2001, more than any other state. Most of these cases came from one jurisdiction, Oklahoma County, where legendary DA Bob Macy bragged of sending more people to death row than any other prosecutor, and police chemist Joyce Gilchrist was eventually fired for mismanaging the crime lab. Examining police records, trial transcripts, appellate decisions and conducting hundreds of interviews, Fuhrman focuses his considerable investigative skills on more than a dozen of the most controversial Oklahoma death penalty cases.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/80/9780060732080.jpg', 'title_long': 'Death and Justice', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.80027801106 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.80027801106}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2004-09-28', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'True Crime', 'Murder & Mayhem', 'Serial Killers', 'Law', 'Criminal Law', 'Specialties', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology'], 'authors': ['Mark Fuhrman'], 'title': 'Death and Justice', 'isbn13': '9780060732080', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006204818X'}, 'isbn': '0060732083', 'isbn10': '0060732083', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062048189', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
