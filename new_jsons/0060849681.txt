{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': "Integrity. It is more than simple honesty. It's the key to success. A person with integrity has the -- often rare -- ability to pull everything together, to make it all happen no matter how challenging the circumstances.<br/>Drawing on experiences from his work with Fortune 500 companies, nonprofits, and individual leaders, Dr. Henry Cloud, a clinical psychologist and nationally syndicated radio host, shows how our character can keep us from achieving all we want to (or could) be.<br/>In Integrity, Dr. Cloud explores the six qualities of character that define integrity. He uses stories from well-known business leaders like Michael Dell and sports figures like Tiger Woods to illustrate each of these qualities. He shows us how people with integrity: Are able to connect with others and build trust Are oriented toward reality Finish well Embrace the negative Are oriented toward increase Have an understanding of the transcendent<br/>Success is not related to only talent or brains. There are a lot of bright, talented people who are never successful. And the most successful are not only the ones with the most talent. The real factor, Cloud demonstrates, is the makeup of the person. All of us can grow in the kinds of real character that bring about fruitful relationships and achievement of purpose, mission, and goals. Integrity is not something that you either have or don't, but instead is an exciting growth path that all of us can engage in and enjoy.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/89/9780060849689.jpg', 'title_long': 'Integrity: The Courage to Meet the Demands of Reality', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.17726847908 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.17726847908}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 292, 'date_published': '2006-02-07', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Success', 'Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Business & Professional Growth', 'Self Help', 'Business & Money', 'Business Culture', 'Motivation & Self-Improvement', 'Management & Leadership', 'Leadership & Motivation', 'Management', 'Motivational', 'Processes & Infrastructure', 'Organizational Learning', 'Human Resources', 'Human Resources & Personnel Management', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Ethics & Morality'], 'authors': ['Henry Cloud'], 'title': 'Integrity: The Courage to Meet the Demands of Reality', 'isbn13': '9780060849689', 'msrp': 24.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060849681', 'isbn10': '0060849681', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061745188', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
