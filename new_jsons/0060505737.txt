{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "New York Times bestselling author Stephanie Laurens has created some of romance's most unforgettable novels. Now she has created her most provocative love story -- and amazing hero -- to date. This is the book that dares to ask the question: Who is this man's ideal bride?<br/>Michael Anstruther-Wetherby is a rising member of Parliament -- a man destined for power. Aristocratic, elegant, and effortlessly charming, he is just arrogant enough to capture the interest of the ladies of the ton. And with his connections to the wealthy and influential Cynster family -- his sister is married to Devil Cynster, the Duke of St. Ives -- his future appears assured.<br/>Except that Michael lacks the single most important element of success: a wife.<br/>Political pressure sends him searching for his ideal bride, a gently bred, malleable young lady, preferably one with a political background. Michael discovers such a paragon but finds a formidable obstacle in his path -- the young lady's beautiful, strong-minded aunt -- Caroline Sutcliffe.<br/>One of London's foremost diplomatic hostesses, Caro has style and status but, having lived through an unhappy political marriage, wants nothing of the sort for her niece, who has already lost her heart to another.<br/>So Caro and the younger woman hatch a plot -- Caro will demonstrate why an inexperienced young lady is not the bride for Michael. She succeeds in convincing him that what he really needs is a lady of experience by his side.<br/>And the perfect candidate is right under his nose -- Caro herself. Then it is Michael's turn to be persuasive, a task that requires every ounce of his seductive charm as he tempts and tantalizes Caro, seeking to convince her that becoming his bride will bring her all her heart desires . . . and more.<br/>But then a series of mysterious, and dangerous, accidents befall Caro -- an assailant has stepped in with their own idea for Caro's future -- one that could involve murder. Before Caro can become Michael's ideal bride, they must race to uncover the unknown's identity before all hope of what they long for, and wish for, is destroyed.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/38/9780060505738.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Ideal Bride', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.48 Pounds, Width: 1.21 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.21}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-03-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Romance', 'American', 'Regency', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Stephanie Laurens'], 'title': 'The Ideal Bride', 'isbn13': '9780060505738', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060505737', 'isbn10': '0060505737'}}
