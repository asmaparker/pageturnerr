But he soon learns that it is actually a women's magazine. He plans to sell it to the editor, but when he sees the beautiful Edwina Parrish behind the desk, he changes his mind. Edwina was his childhood Nemesis, besting him in many competitions and winning from him a family heirloom. He's never forgotten it and so proposes another wager: If she wins, he'll give her the magazine; if he wins, he keeps the magazine and gets his heirloom back.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/39/9780060505639.jpg', 'title_long': "Once a Scoundrel (Ladies' Fashionable Cabinet Trilogy, 2)", 'edition': 'Regular Print/Single Titl', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-07-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Historical', '20th Century', 'Regency'], 'authors': ['Candice Hern'], 'title': "Once a Scoundrel (Ladies' Fashionable Cabinet Trilogy, 2)", 'isbn13': '9780060505639', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006175112X'}, 'isbn': '006050563X', 'isbn10': '006050563X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061751127', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
