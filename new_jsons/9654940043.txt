{'book': {'publisher': 'Astrolog Publishing House', 'synopsis': 'Foretelling the future through coffee grounds and tea leaves - or reading the past, the future, and hallmarks of the present - is an ancient art form. Like other forms of mysticism and prophecy, it is reminiscent of palm reading, star gazing, dream interpretation, and card reading; but beyond the similarities there also lies an essential difference. You are actually holding two separate books. The first, and relatively simple, book interprets the signs that appear in coffee grounds. The second book is more complex. It tries to explain the way in which the spirit of inspiration and prophecy rests upon the reader or medium, and how the reader of coffee grounds enters into the being of the seeker of wisdom, using the coffee as an intermediary.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/47/9789654940047.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Complete Guide to Coffee Grounds and Tea Leaf Reading (Complete Guides series)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.55 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.55}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '1998-04-01', 'subjects': ['Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Divination', 'Occult & Paranormal'], 'authors': ['Sara Zed'], 'title': 'The Complete Guide to Coffee Grounds and Tea Leaf Reading (Complete Guides series)', 'isbn13': '9789654940047', 'msrp': 6.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9654940043', 'isbn10': '9654940043'}}
