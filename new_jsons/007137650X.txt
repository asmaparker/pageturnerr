A new 41-page index provides an accurate point of entry to a plethora of aviation names, numbers, and facts describing the condition of civilian and military aviation worldwide. Of particular interest are the specifications for every civil and military aircraft, missile, space vehicle, and electronic warfare system currently in production.
