{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Fall in love with the first book in Debbie Macomber's Deliverance Company series featuring a romance between a mercenary and a widow inexplicably drawn together.<br/>Cain McClellan had chosen his lifestyle. He thrived on the challenge, the rush that came with putting his life in incredible danger. No woman, he told himself, could make him feel the way he did after a successful missionâ€”no matter how beautiful she was.<br/>So why was he standing on a cold pier like a lovelorn teenager, hoping for a glimpse of Linette Collins?<br/>But then he saw her, and the sight of her took his breath away. The wind whipped her lustrous dark hair about her face, and she lifted a finger to wrap a thick strand behind her ear.<br/>The smart thing to do was turn around and walk away as fast as his feet would carry him. He'd gotten what he wanted. One last look at her. His curiosity should be satisfied. But even as his mind formulated the thought, Cain knew that just seeing Linette again could never be enough", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/99/9780061083099.jpg', 'title_long': 'Someday Soon (Deliverance Company #1)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.94 Inches, Length: 6.74 Inches, Weight: 0.37037660016 Pounds, Width: 4.26 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.74}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.26}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.37037660016}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.94}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-06-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Military', 'Holidays', 'Clean & Wholesome'], 'authors': ['Debbie Macomber'], 'title': 'Someday Soon (Deliverance Company #1)', 'isbn13': '9780061083099', 'msrp': 2.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061763608'}, 'isbn': '0061083097', 'isbn10': '0061083097', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061763601', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
