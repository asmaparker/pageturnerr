{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Martin Brock is living a wasted life. He wants to be happy. He wants to have a girlfriend who can stand to be near him. He wants his friends to respect him. Burned out and self-deluded, he takes each day as it comes, dealing low-quality cocaine to tourists, his head in a perpetual cloud of pot smoke. Martin knows he's in a rut, but he lacks the will to dig himself out. Incapable of changing his life, he hopes instead that one day something momentous will simply fall into his lap.<br/>And, one day, it does. An old friend rides into town, unannounced and uninvited, needing a place to lie low for a couple of days. He says he's been in a motorcycle accident, and hides a badly infected leg beneath his expensive leathers. Martin almost cares, but he's far more interested in what's concealed beneath the seat of the bike: five kilos of high-grade cocaine. Suddenly Martin has the means to escape his miserable existence: all he needs is a little time and a lot of luck. But Martin Brock is not a lucky man. He's spent years dreaming of a life of ease, a life of plenty, and a life of unlimited narcotics. By the end of the week, he'll settle for any life at all.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/96/9780060585396.jpg', 'title_long': 'Twelve-Step Fandango', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 8.25 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.79}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 8.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2004-03-16', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Domestic'], 'authors': ['Chris Haslam'], 'title': 'Twelve-Step Fandango', 'isbn13': '9780060585396', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060585390', 'isbn10': '0060585390', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061881961', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
