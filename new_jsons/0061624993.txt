{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperColl', 'synopsis': 'Eleanor "Groovy" Robinson loves cooking and plans to go to culinary school just as soon as she\'s old enough. But even Groovy\'s thoughtfully—planned menus won\'t fix the things that start to go wrong the year she turns eleven—suddenly, her father is in jail, her best friend\'s long-absent mother reappears, and the swallows that make their annual migration to her hometown arrive surprisingly early. As Groovy begins to expect the unexpected, she learns about the importance of forgiveness, understands the complex stories of the people around her, and realizes that even an earthquake can\'t get in the way of a family that needs to come together.<br/>Kathryn Fitzmaurice\'s lovely debut novel is distinctively Californian in its flavor. Her rich characters and strong sense of place feel both familiar and fresh at first meeting—and worth revisiting, again and again.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/95/9780061624995.jpg', 'title_long': 'Year the Swallows Came Early, The', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 277, 'date_published': '2009-02-03', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Birds', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life'], 'authors': ['Kathryn Fitzmaurice'], 'title': 'Year the Swallows Came Early, The', 'isbn13': '9780061624995', 'msrp': 17.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0061624993', 'isbn10': '0061624993'}}
