{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'All the world\'s a stage in this delightful new whodunit from the incomparable Jill Churchill -- as suburban mom and sometime sleuth Jane Jeffry and best friend Shelley Nowack try to bring the curtain down on a killer. ...<br/>Jane Jeffry has a new hobby: the stage, specifically a rundown theater that close pal Shelley and her husband have donated to a local college drama department. Students from the nearby college are in rehearsal there for a never-before-produced "magnum opus" written by the company\'s director, a surefire bomb-in-the-making distinctly lacking in style, wit, and substance. Though Jane\'s connection is culinary -- helping Shelley handle caterers who will be feeding the actors -- she\'s soon drawn deeper into the drama than she ever hoped or anticipated.<br/>What a scene it is, with petty offstage feuds and jealousies, ego trips, and power struggles between the clueless director-author and his dubiously talent ed cast. Even the presence of two aging professional thespians -- a lecherous old boozer and his genteel, seriously gifted wife -- does nothing to stabilize a volatile situation. And the plot takes a decidedly darker turn when a particularly rebellious young performer exits stage left -- permanently -- courtesy of a head-bashing killer.<br/>Hark! It\'s murder, which means it\'s a cue for Detective Mel VanDyne, Jane\'s longtime leading man, to get into the act. But Jane and Shelley have their own roles to play in this twisted true-life theatrical, where each member of the dramatis personae has a makeup case full of secrets, masks, and motives. And they\'ll have to act fast to uncover the villain of the piece before the denouement turns into a real, corpse-strewn, Shakespearean-style tragedy!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/81/9780060097981.jpg', 'title_long': "A Midsummer Night's Scream (Jane Jeffry Mysteries, No. 15)", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2004-11-23', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Jill Churchill'], 'title': "A Midsummer Night's Scream (Jane Jeffry Mysteries, No. 15)", 'isbn13': '9780060097981', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060097981', 'isbn10': '0060097981'}}
