Content meets curriculum as required by federal regulators and prepares readers to take the certification examination. It features a consistent approach in which each systems chapter first discusses the normal anatomy and physiology of the body system; then presents age-related changes and common abnormalities, along with related nursing-care guidelines and step-by-step procedures. The book's full-color, extensively illustrated format, accessible reading level, and short manageable sections in a consistent format make it particularly appropriate for today's adult learners.
