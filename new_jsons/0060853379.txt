{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "We all watched Terri Schiavo die. The controversy around her case dominated the headlines and talk shows, going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the White House, and the Vatican.<br/>And it's not over yet. Despite her death, the controversy lingers. In Silent Witness, former LAPD detective and New York Times bestselling author Mark Fuhrman applies his highly respected investigative skills to examine the medical evidence, legal case files, and police records. With the complete cooperation of Terri Schiavo's parents and siblings, as well as their medical and legal advisers, he conducts exclusive interviews with forensics experts and crucial witnesses, including friends, family members, and caregivers.<br/>Fuhrman's findings will answer these questions: What was Terri and Michael Schiavo's marriage really like? What happened the day Terri collapsed? What did Michael Schiavo do when he discovered Terri unconscious? How long did he wait before calling 911? What do medical records show about her condition when she was first admitted to the hospital? What will the autopsy say?<br/>The legal issues and ethical questions provoked by Terri Schiavo's extraordinary case may never be resolved. But the facts about her marriage, her condition when she collapsed, and her eventual death fifteen years later can be determined.<br/>With Silent Witness, Fuhrman goes beyond the legal aspects of the case and delves into the broader, human background of Terri Schiavo's short, sad life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/72/9780060853372.jpg', 'title_long': "Silent Witness: The Untold Story of Terri Schiavo's Death", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2005-06-28', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Death & Grief', 'Grief & Bereavement', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Public Affairs & Policy'], 'authors': ['Mark Fuhrman'], 'title': "Silent Witness: The Untold Story of Terri Schiavo's Death", 'isbn13': '9780060853372', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0061752010'}, 'isbn': '0060853379', 'isbn10': '0060853379', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061752018', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
