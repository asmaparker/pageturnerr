{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon Red', 'synopsis': 'Prim, headstrong, and beautiful Penelope is determined to expose the licentious affairs of the ton\'s randiest rakes. Now one of their powerful number—the unrepentant libertine Jeremy Vaughn, Duke of Kilgrath—has been selected to put an end to the prudish lady\'s interference. Jeremy\'s plan is devilishly clever: He will join Penelope\'s war against immorality, fighting passionately by her side, all the while showering her with anonymous erotic missives designed to titillate even the coldest, most unwilling maid. He will break down her defenses and inflame her repressed desires by escorting her (in the interests of their "noble campaign") to London\'s most notorious pleasure palaces. And he will visit her boudoir—masked—during the night to school her in the deliciously sinful arts she wishes to abolish. Then he will expose her hypocrisy to the world.<br/>But the handsome rogue\'s scheme is doomed to go awry, even as the lovely Penelope sheds her every inhibition and freely gives in to his every whim. For in this sensuous game of hearts, it\'s the seducer who becomes seduced . . .', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/70/9780061283970.jpg', 'title_long': 'Something Reckless (Albright Sisters Series, 2)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.61}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 264, 'date_published': '2008-04-22', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Erotica', 'BDSM', 'Historical', 'Romantic'], 'authors': ['Jess Michaels'], 'title': 'Something Reckless (Albright Sisters Series, 2)', 'isbn13': '9780061283970', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061752487'}, 'isbn': '0061283975', 'isbn10': '0061283975', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061752483', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
