{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow & Co', 'synopsis': "The renowned novelist and poet Marge Piercy tells a contemporary love story set in the twin realms of college and national politics<br/>In the politically prominent Dickinson family, ambition comes first, and Melissa, the third child, has always felt that she comes last. Going away to college offers her a chance at a life free from her brilliant mother's constant scrutiny and her famous father's lack of interest.<br/>There she meets Blake, a man of mixed race and apparently unknown parentage. His adoptive parents are lawyers whose defense of death- row cases has brought them head-to-head with Melissa's father, the former governor of Pennsylvania who is now a U.S. senator.<br/>Melissa and Blake's attraction is immediate; their affair, fiery. Yet Blake is keeping a dangerous secret from Melissa, one that could destroy them -- and their families.<br/>Dealing with themes of love, honesty, identity, and the consequences of ambition, this thoughtful, beautifully written story is a remarkable and provocative page-turner.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/69/9780066211169.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Third Child', 'edition': 'F First Edition Used', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2003-11-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological'], 'authors': ['Marge Piercy'], 'title': 'The Third Child', 'isbn13': '9780066211169', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0066211166', 'isbn10': '0066211166'}}
