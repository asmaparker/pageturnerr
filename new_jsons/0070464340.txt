{'book': {'publisher': 'International Marine', 'synopsis': "Ever daydream about what it's like to quit your job, sell your house and most of your possessions, say good-bye to your neighbors, and set sail with your family--permanently? Tom and Mel Neale left their 9 to 5 world nearly two decades ago and never looked back. In 1979 the Neales left their law and education careers and traded their suburban home for a three-room boat. Now their neighborhood is a Chesapeake Bay cove, or a secluded Bahamian beach, or anywhere else they choose to anchor. And along the way they raised two daughters. For the Neales, living aboard and cruising is about taking control of their world and their environment, a sometimes difficult but always rewarding existence. All in the Same Boat is one family's testament to the belief that you can lead your own life, whatever that might be. For the Neales, it hasn't been a vacation. Instead of living to work, they work to live, but they make time for adventure and play, too. Here's everything you need to know to follow them: choosing the right boat; provisioning for long-term cruising; getting along in close quarters; learning what you can leave behind; earning a living--and how to hold on to the money; what to expect in the cruising life, and how to handle it; preparing the crew and boat; raising--and educating--kids; keeping in touch; making the ocean your backyard.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/46/9780070464346.jpg', 'title_long': 'All in the Same Boat: Family Living Aboard and Cruising', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.10010668738 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.10010668738}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 374, 'date_published': '1997-01-01', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Water Sports', 'Boating'], 'authors': ['Tom Neale'], 'title': 'All in the Same Boat: Family Living Aboard and Cruising', 'isbn13': '9780070464346', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0070464340', 'isbn10': '0070464340'}}
