{'book': {'publisher': 'Brooks Cole', 'synopsis': 'This established manual contains both classical experiments and "guided discovery" experiments in which students are given background information and are required to devise hypotheses, design procedures to test those hypotheses, evaluate their results, and to make suggestions for improving their work. Experiments are written to address students of various academic backgrounds and differing interests and abilities in chemistry. The experiments presented minimize the use of hazardous materials and provide detailed instructions on disposing of wastes. The Fifth Edition also allows experiments to be conducted in a conventional laboratory setting or with CBL-2 technology. While most experiments can be conducted in a single three-hour period, some have been designed to be completed over an extended time to illustrate that chemical systems do not work at an arbitrary schedule. Suggestions are provided for combining experiments of shorter length and similar pedagogy.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/98/9780030206498.jpg', 'title_long': 'Laboratory Manual for Hunt’s General Chemistry, 3rd', 'edition': '3', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 1.3889122506 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3889122506}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11}}, 'pages': 477, 'date_published': '1997-09-10', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Chemistry', 'General & Reference', 'Experiments, Instruments & Measurement', 'Experiments & Projects', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Todd Hunt'], 'title': 'Laboratory Manual for Hunt’s General Chemistry, 3rd', 'isbn13': '9780030206498', 'msrp': 73.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0030206499', 'isbn10': '0030206499'}}
