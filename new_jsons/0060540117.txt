{'book': {'publisher': 'Eos', 'synopsis': "The ancient dragons -- of the time of the legendary Saint George and earlier -- have never disappeared entirely. Instead, they've moved undercover -- and into human society. Now one lonely schoolboy is about to learn where the dragons have gone ...<br/>Educated at boarding schools, Simon St. George has never met his parents. When a ragged-looking man shows up claiming to be his father, Simon is skeptical, and when the man kidnaps him, he's indignant to say the least.<br/>Then the man claims to be a descendant of England's Saint George and a career dragon fighter. Why should Simon believe any of this nonsense? But what if the man is telling the truth? What if the dragons know he's out there?<br/>Rich with the dragon lore of legend, the saint of dragons continues and enlarges on the tale of the centuries-old conflict between dragons and humans that rages even today.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/11/9780060540111.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Saint of Dragons', 'edition': 'First Edition first Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.01 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.01}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2004-09-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Action & Adventure', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy & Magic', 'Fantasy', 'Sword & Sorcery', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Jason Hightman'], 'title': 'The Saint of Dragons', 'isbn13': '9780060540111', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060540117', 'isbn10': '0060540117'}}
