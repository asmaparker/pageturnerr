{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Try as hard as you like, there's just no pleasing a disapproving rabbit<br/>Let them hop around your house, they'll disapprove of your decorating skills. Feed them tasty veggies, they'll disapprove of your culinary skills. Sit together in your yard, and they'll disapprove of your gardening (even as they devour it).<br/>Long thought of as mindless raiders of gardens and happy couriers of colored eggs, it's almost as if rabbits have been getting the best of us for years, secretly disapproving of all our non-rabbit ways.<br/>Fortunately Sharon Stiteler, known as the Bird Chick for her work in the birding community, began to notice something not-quite-right about her pet rabbit Cinnamon. It appeared that Cinnamon didn't approve . . . of anything. After studying a great many photos, Sharon has soundly and without-out-a-doubt proved that rabbits have some major attitude.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/84/9780061353284.jpg', 'title_long': 'Disapproving Rabbits', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.12 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.59}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.12}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2007-10-16', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Musical Genres', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Cats, Dogs & Animals', 'Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Rabbits', 'Mice, Hamsters & Guinea Pigs', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Fauna'], 'authors': ['Sharon Stiteler'], 'title': 'Disapproving Rabbits', 'isbn13': '9780061353284', 'msrp': 10.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0061353280', 'isbn10': '0061353280'}}
