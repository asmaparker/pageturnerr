Teens have relied on her straight-shooting advice \'in her columns and television appearances. She\'s been called "TVs # 1 talk-show therapist, hotter than the Sahara, part philosopher and part stand-up comic" (Gannett).<br/>Now, Dr Carle brings her effective, commonsense approach on romance to teenage girls. He\'s Not All That! shows girls how to protect themselves from the not-so-good guys. Her direct and honest writing demonstrates how to find stable, loving relationships-both with guys and girls-and prevent a lifetime of unhealthy and unhappy commitments. The book is jam-packed with quizzes, exercises, and, of course, her famous "Gilda-Grams," which are guaranteed to address girls\' most pressing problems.<br/>He\'s Not All That! includes unique empowerment tools that make girls independent thinkers who don\'t let boys or friends rule their lives. Girls will learn how to feel good about themselves-no matter who is trying to pull them down-and to confront people who don\'t have their best interests at heart. They will feel competent and confident wherever they go.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/41/9780060199241.jpg', 'title_long': "He's Not All That!: How to Attract the Good Guys", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2000-12-26', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', "Children's Books", 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Teenagers', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Social Issues', 'Dating & Intimacy'], 'authors': ['Dr. Gilda Carle'], 'title': "He's Not All That!: How to Attract the Good Guys", 'isbn13': '9780060199241', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060199245', 'isbn10': '0060199245'}}
