{'book': {'publisher': 'It Books', 'synopsis': "Simpsons Comics Barn Burner, brought to you by Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, takes the blue–ribbon prize for being one jimdandy of a good time.<br/>Get ready for the dadburndest, rootin'–tootin'–est riot of cotton–pickin' Simpsons comics EVER! First, Bart takes his life in his hands when he rats out the school bullies. Next, Homer squares off against Diamond Joe Quimby when he runs for mayor. And when the kids from Springfield form their own boy band, nobody's eardrums are safe. Then watch the oven mitts come off when Smithers moves in and starts catering to Homer's every need ... leaving Marge out in the cold. And read all about it when Bart makes headlines and learns the true meaning of yellow journalism. Cap it all off with a story of biblical proportions, and you've got one bronco–bustin', banjo–pluckin', cattle–rustlin', moonshinin', hog–tossin', tobacky–spittin', mule kickin', cousin–kissin' collection that'll have you promenadin' across the floor at the next ice–cream social. This big, burstin' barrel o' fun will have you plum–tuckered out from laughter.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/80/9780060748180.jpg', 'title_long': 'Simpsons Comics Barn Burner', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 0.25 Inches, Width: 6.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2005-02-15', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Comic Strips', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations'], 'authors': ['Matt Groening'], 'title': 'Simpsons Comics Barn Burner', 'isbn13': '9780060748180', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060748184', 'isbn10': '0060748184'}}
