{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': 'From the highly acclaimed new crime novelist: a story of witness protection, petty thievery, local politics, and murder―set against the turbulent backdrop of the 1980 presidential election<br/>It’s the fall of 1980, the last week before the presidential election that pits the downtrodden Jimmy Carter against the suspiciously sunny Ronald Reagan. In a seedy suburban house in Spokane, a small-time crook formerly from New York, Vince Camden, pockets his weekly allotment of stolen credit cards and heads off to his witness-protection job at a donut shop. A the shop he takes a shine to a regular named Kelly, who works for a local politician. Somehow he finds himself and the politician in a parking lot at three in the morning, giving the slip to a couple of menacing thugs. And then he crosses the path of a young detective―and discovers his credit-scam partner, lying dead in his passport-photo office with a Cheerio-size bullet-hole in his head. No one writing crime novels today tells a story or sketches a character with more freshness or elan than Jess Walter. Citizen Vince is his funniest and grittiest book yet.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/93/9780060989293.jpg', 'title_long': 'Citizen Vince: An Edgar Award Winner', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 293, 'date_published': '2006-10-17', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Political', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Jess Walter'], 'title': 'Citizen Vince: An Edgar Award Winner', 'isbn13': '9780060989293', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060989297', 'isbn10': '0060989297'}}
