{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': "Practicing the True Spirit of Zen<br/>Not Always So is based on Shunryu Suzuki's lectures and is framed in his own inimitable allusive, paradoxical style, rich with unexpected and off–centre insights. Suzuki knew he was dying at the time of the lectures, which gives his thoughts an urgency and focus even sharper than in the earlier book.<br/>In Not Always So Suzuki Roshi once again voices Zen in everyday language with the vigour, sensitivity, and buoyancy of a true friend. Here is support and nourishment. Here is a mother and father lending a hand, but letting you find your own way. Here is guidance which empowers your freedom (or way–seeking mind), rather than pinning you down to directions and techniques. Here is teaching which encourages you to touch and know your true heart and to express yourself fully, teaching which is not teaching from outside, but a voice arising in your own being.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/58/9780060197858.jpg', 'title_long': 'Not Always So: Practicing the True Spirit of Zen', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.84 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.73}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.84}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2002-05-28', 'subjects': ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Zen', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Eastern', 'Movements'], 'authors': ['Shunryu Suzuki', 'Edward Espe Brown', 'Zen Center San Francisco'], 'title': 'Not Always So: Practicing the True Spirit of Zen', 'isbn13': '9780060197858', 'msrp': 22.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060197854', 'isbn10': '0060197854'}}
