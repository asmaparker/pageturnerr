{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt Rinehart', 'synopsis': "Since it was first published in 1865, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has become one of the most beloved children's books ever written. Noted for its fantastic plot and brilliant use of nonsense, the book can be read on many levels and appeals as much to adults as to children. The incredible creatures who inhabit Wonderland have attracted hundreds of illustrators, each of whom has interpreted Carroll's work in a different way. Now, Michael Hague has created his own unique versions of the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Chesire Cat, and all the other strange creatures who fill Alice's world", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/03/77/9780030020377.jpg', 'title_long': "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.35 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}}, 'pages': 122, 'date_published': '1985', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Classics', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Lewis Carroll'], 'title': "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", 'isbn13': '9780030020377', 'msrp': 35.13, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0030020379', 'isbn10': '0030020379'}}
