{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'When kids start going on TV binges or devouring fistfuls of cookies, it\'s easy to say, "They\'ll grow out of it." More likely, they\'re acquiring bad habits that could lead to childhood obesity and chronic adult diseases, from diabetes and depression to heart trouble and osteoporosis.<br/>But by making simple changes now, you can help your children avoid these problems later. Good Kids, Bad Habits supplies the tools you need, starting with the unique RealAge® Healthy Kids Test. Based on the proven RealAge Test, which measures biological—not calendar—age, the Healthy Kids Test reveals where children are doing fine and where they\'re headed for health trouble.<br/>Regardless of the problem—from sleeplessness to video-game addiction—Dr. Jen has seen and solved it all, working with parents and kids together. Her insightful tips, preventive steps, and kid smarts, learned from working with thousands of children, make this book invaluable. It will help your kids grow into the healthiest adults they can be—while still allowing them to be kids.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/55/9780061127755.jpg', 'title_long': 'Good Kids, Bad Habits: The RealAge Guide to Raising Healthy Children', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 7.38 Inches, Weight: 1.08467432904 Pounds, Width: 0.84 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.38}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.84}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.08467432904}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2007-02-27', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Personal Transformation', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Early Childhood'], 'authors': ['Dr. Jennifer Trachtenberg'], 'title': 'Good Kids, Bad Habits: The RealAge Guide to Raising Healthy Children', 'isbn13': '9780061127755', 'msrp': 21.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0062035029'}, 'isbn': '0061127752', 'isbn10': '0061127752', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062035028', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
