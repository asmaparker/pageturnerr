{'book': {'publisher': 'Smithsonian', 'synopsis': '“Riveting and suspenseful… This is history the way we all wish it could be written—and experienced.” — Richard Smith, author of Patriarch: George Washington and the New American Nation<br/>On October 19, 1781, Great Britain\'s best army surrendered to General George Washington at Yorktown. But the future of the 13 former colonies was far from clear. A 13,000 man British army still occupied New York City, and another 13,000 regulars and armed loyalists were scattered from Canada to Savannah, Georgia. Meanwhile, Congress had declined to a mere 24 members, and the national treasury was empty. The American army had not been paid for years and was on the brink of mutiny.<br/>In Europe, America\'s only ally, France, teetered on the verge of bankruptcy and was soon reeling from a disastrous naval defeat in the Caribbean. A stubborn George III dismissed Yorktown as a minor defeat and refused to yield an acre of "my dominions" in America. In Paris, Ambassador Benjamin Franklin confronted violent hostility to France among his fellow members of the American peace delegation.<br/>Thomas Fleming moves elegantly between the key players in this drama and shows that the outcome we take for granted was far from certain. With fresh research and masterful storytelling, Fleming breathes new life into this tumultuous but little known period in America\'s history.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/09/9780061139109.jpg', 'title_long': "The Perils of Peace: America's Struggle for Survival After Yorktown", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.19 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.19}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2007-10-09', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Military', 'World', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science'], 'authors': ['Thomas Fleming'], 'title': "The Perils of Peace: America's Struggle for Survival After Yorktown", 'isbn13': '9780061139109', 'msrp': 27.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061139106', 'isbn10': '0061139106'}}
