{'book': {'publisher': 'Campfire', 'synopsis': "Ancient Egypt. In the time of the pyramids and pharaoh kings! A beautiful young princess has travelled to the grand capital of Memphis -- home to the legendary pharaoh Rhampsinitus. She has journeyed from the western lands in search of a husband. But while meeting with the local men, the princess becomes privy to a secret tale. It is a story of desperation, thievery, and murder. But it is also a story of family, sacrifice and love. As this tale is laid bare before her, the princess learns of three feats of impossible brotherhood, ingenuity, and boldness on the part of a man who would thwart the will of a king. This clever thief would deny the pharaoh not once or twice but triumph through three impossible scenarios. And it all began with a secret passageway built into the newly constructed vault for the pharaoh's grand treasure stores. Come with us on a tale of adventure and excitement as we see a legend unfold that creates the infamy of one of the greatest thieves in the ancient world. You will see how his boldness and razor sharp mind earned him wealth, respect, and even the woman of his dreams. Step quickly. The sands are calling and adventure awaits!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/27/9789380028927.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Treasured Thief (Original)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.50392 Inches, Length: 6.65353 Inches, Weight: 0.37919506587853 Pounds, Width: 0.15748 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.65353}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.15748}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.37919506587853}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.50392}}, 'pages': 64, 'date_published': '2012-01-01', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Ryan Foley'], 'title': 'The Treasured Thief (Original)', 'isbn13': '9789380028927', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '938002892X', 'isbn10': '938002892X'}}
