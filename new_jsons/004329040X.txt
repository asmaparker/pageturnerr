{'book': {'publisher': 'Unwin Hyman', 'synopsis': 'First published in 1982, this book explores how Khrushchev and Brezhnev manipulated their policies and personal images as they attempted to consolidate their authority as leader. Central issues of Soviet domestic politics are investment priorities, incentive policy, administrative reform, and political participation. The author rejects the conventional images of Khrushchev as an embattled consumer advocate and decentraliser, and of Brezhnev’s leadership as dull and conservative. He looks at how they dealt with the task of devising programs that combined the post-Stalin elite’s goals of consumer satisfaction and expanded political participation with traditional Soviet values.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/08/9780043290408.jpg', 'title_long': 'Khrushchev and Brezhnev As Leaders: Building Authority in Soviet Politics', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'weight: 458 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 458}}, 'pages': 280, 'date_published': '1982', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['George Breslauer'], 'title': 'Khrushchev and Brezhnev As Leaders: Building Authority in Soviet Politics', 'isbn13': '9780043290408', 'msrp': 15.3, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '004329040X', 'isbn10': '004329040X'}}
