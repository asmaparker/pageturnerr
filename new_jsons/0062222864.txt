{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Large Print', 'synopsis': "Harry and Madeleine Winslow have been blessed with talent, money, and charm. Warm and affluent, they play host to a coterie of close friends and acolytes eager to bask in their golden radiance. One weekend at the start of the summer season, Harry and Maddy meet Claire and cannot help but be enchanted by her. Drawn by the Winslows' magnetism, Claire eagerly falls into their welcoming orbit. But, over the course of the summer, her reverence transforms into a dangerous desire. By Labor Day, it is no longer enough to remain one of their hangers-on.<br/>A story of love, lust, deception, and betrayal told through the omniscient eyes of Maddy's childhood friend Walter, a narrator akin to Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby, Indiscretion is an irresistibly sensual page-turner that explores having it all, and the consequences of wanting more.<br/>Indiscretion also marks the debut of a remarkably gifted writer and storyteller, whose unique voice bears all the hallmarks of an exciting new literary talent.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/62/9780062222862.jpg', 'title_long': 'Indiscretion: A Novel', 'edition': 'Large type / Large print', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.1794731017 Pounds, Width: 1.02 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.02}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1794731017}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 512, 'date_published': '2013-02-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'New Adult & College'], 'authors': ['Charles Dubow'], 'title': 'Indiscretion: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780062222862', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0062222864', 'isbn10': '0062222864'}}
