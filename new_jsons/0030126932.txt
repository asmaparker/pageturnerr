{'book': {'publisher': 'Harcourt School', 'synopsis': 'The Fifth Edition of PRACTICAL LOGIC continues its tradition as a breakthrough introductory text by de-emphasizing symbolic logic and scientific method, instead presenting the practical aspects of logic and critical thinking. The text does not mistake technical apparatus (charts, decision trees, and models) for clarity, and consequently does not burden students with confusing and unnecessary barriers to critical assessment of arguments and claims. PRACTICAL LOGIC combines clear writing and a wealth of everyday examples to make logic accessible and relevant to the beginning student. Logic and critical thinking are even easier to understand in this streamlined new edition. With its clear language and interesting, realistic examples, students learn to recognize clear arguments and to employ critical thinking in all areas of study. Full treatment of knowledge claims (epistemology) addresses issues of expertise, authority, and relativity. Over 1200 exercises include open-ended discussion questions as well as standard exercises that help students review and assimilate concepts.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/32/9780030126932.jpg', 'title_long': 'Practical Logic', 'edition': '3rd', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.45725555182 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.45725555182}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '1988', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Logic & Language'], 'authors': ['Vincent E.
