{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': "With a body twisted by adolescent scoliosis and memories of the brutal death of a woman he loved, Lynn Schooler kept the world at arm's length, drifting through the wilds of Alaska as a commercial fisherman, outdoorsman, and wilderness guide. In 1990, Schooler met Japanese photographer Michio Hoshino, and began a profound friendship cemented by a shared love of adventure and a passionate quest to find the elusive glacier bear, an exceedingly rare creature, seldom seen and shrouded in legend. But only after Hoshino's tragic death from a bear attack does Schooler succeed in photographing the animal -- completing a remarkable journey that ultimately brings new meaning to his life.<br/>The Blue Bear is an unforgettable book. Set amid the wild archipelagoes, deep glittering fjords, and dense primordial forests of Alaska's Glacier Coast, it is rich with the lyric sensibility and stunning prose of such nature classics as Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams and Peter Matthiessen's The Snow Leopard.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/57/33/9780060935733.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Blue Bear: A True Story of Friendship and Discovery in the Alaskan Wild', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.59 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.59}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2003-05-06', 'subjects': ['Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Nature Writing & Essays', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Winter Sports', 'Field Guides', 'Mammals', 'Travel', 'Polar Regions', 'Antarctica', 'Arctic', 'Specialty Travel', 'Adventure', 'United States', 'West'], 'authors': ['Lynn Schooler'], 'title': 'The Blue Bear: A True Story of Friendship and Discovery in the Alaskan Wild', 'isbn13': '9780060935733', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060935731', 'isbn10': '0060935731'}}
