{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "In the final instalment of Gayle Callen's exciting Spies and Lovers trilogy, a mad–dash search for truth brings together an unlikely pair – a woman accused of treason, and the man who convicted her...<br/>Now that he finally has the infamous traitor, Julia Reed, in jail, you would think English agent Samuel Sherryngton would be pleased to see justice served. But circumstances aren't always what they appear to be, and the facts aren't adding up. Soon Sam has doubts over her guilt which, of course, has nothing to do with the attraction for Julia he's been fighting against for so many years. Not willing to see her executed for a crime she may not have committed, Sam defies the laws of England and breaks Julia out of jail. What initially began as a search to find proof convicting Julia quickly turns into a quest to prove her innocence. Can this bold and dashing pair discover the truth and still find time for love?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/69/9780060543969.jpg', 'title_long': "A Woman's Innocence (Spies and Lovers, 3)", 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-03-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'American', 'Regency', 'Romantic Suspense'], 'authors': ['Gayle Callen'], 'title': "A Woman's Innocence (Spies and Lovers, 3)", 'isbn13': '9780060543969', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006194615X'}, 'isbn': '0060543965', 'isbn10': '0060543965', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061946158', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
