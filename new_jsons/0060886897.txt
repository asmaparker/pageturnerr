{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': '"CHANGE OR DIE. What if you were given that choice? We\'re talking actual life and death now. Your own life and death. What if a well-informed, trusted authority figure said you had to make difficult and enduring changes in the way you think, feel, and act? If you didn\'t, your time would end soon—a lot sooner than it had to. Could you change when change mattered most?"<br/>This is the question Alan Deutschman poses in Change or Die, which began as a sensational cover story by the same title for Fast Company. Deutschman concludes that although we all have the ability to change our behavior, we rarely ever do. In fact, the odds are nine to one that, when faced with the dire need to change, we won\'t. From patients suffering from heart disease to repeat offenders in the criminal justice system to companies trapped in the mold of unsuccessful business practices, many of us could prevent ominous outcomes by simply changing our mindset.<br/>A powerful book with universal appeal, Change or Die deconstructs and debunks age-old myths about change and empowers us with three critical keys—relate, repeat, and reframe—to help us make important positive changes in our lives. Explaining breakthrough research and progressive ideas from a wide selection of leaders in medicine, science, and business (including Dr. Dean Ornish, Mimi Silbert of the Delancey Street Foundation, Bill Gates, Daniel Boulud, and many others), Deutschman demonstrates how anyone can achieve lasting, revolutionary change.<br/>Change or Die is not about merely reorganizing or restructuring priorities; it\'s about challenging, inspiring, and helping all of us to make the dramatic transformations necessary in any aspect of life—changes that are positive, attainable, and absolutely vital.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/99/9780060886899.jpg', 'title_long': 'Change or Die: The Three Keys to Change at Work and in Life', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.04 Pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.89}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2007-01-02', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Business Culture', 'Motivation & Self-Improvement', 'Management & Leadership', 'Leadership & Motivation', 'Motivational', 'Systems & Planning', 'Processes & Infrastructure', 'Strategic Planning', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Occupational & Organizational'], 'authors': ['Alan Deutschman'], 'title': 'Change or Die: The Three Keys to Change at Work and in Life', 'isbn13': '9780060886899', 'msrp': 26.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060886897', 'isbn10': '0060886897'}}
