But the only way to protect what is hers is to seek out the man she married in childhood.<br/>A proud, tormented warrior, Christian of Acre owes allegiance only to the mysterious Brotherhood -- and has no wish to be king over anyone but himself. Now a bold and beautiful stranger has appeared in his rooms, tempting him with an irresistible seduction and demanding he accompany her back to their kingdoms ... or, at the very least, provide her with an heir to her throne. Though he cannot abandon the brave regal lady to her enemies, Christian dares not give in to his traitorous body's desires. Yet how can he deny the passion that is rightfully his and the ecstasy that awaits him in Adara's kiss?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/35/9780060565435.jpg', 'title_long': 'Return of the Warrior (Brotherhood of the Sword, Book 2)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 1.15522225288 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15522225288}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-04-26', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Entertaining & Holidays', 'Tablesetting', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Medieval', 'Scottish', 'Victorian'], 'authors': ['Kinley MacGregor'], 'title': 'Return of the Warrior (Brotherhood of the Sword, Book 2)', 'isbn13': '9780060565435', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061753165'}, 'isbn': '0060565438', 'isbn10': '0060565438', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061753169', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
