From Publishers Weekly      PreSchool-Grade 2-This sweet story shows a toddler doing what comes naturally and a loving caregiver being patient yet directive. When Little Bear wakes Grandpa Bear from his nap to play Grandpa joins in eagerly. Little Bear hauls out his blocks, builds a tower, and knocks it over. They do this again and again. Grandpa also plays along when they build sand castles that Little Bear demolishes almost as soon as they are built. Determined to make the afternoon more productive, Grandpa decides to play at watering the garden. Over and over they fill the watering can and empty it until the job is done. Thoroughly tired, Grandpa coaxes Little Bear back to the hammock for a story and then-at last-a nap. The lovely illustrations show the characters in a gorgeous flower garden. Recommended for public libraries as well as bookstores.
