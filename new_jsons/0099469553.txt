{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage Books USA', 'synopsis': 'The opera singer Sophia Sim√©onidis wakes up one morning to discover that a tree has appeared overnight in the garden of her Paris house. Intrigued and unnerved, she turns to her neighbours: Vandoosler, an ex-cop, and three impecunious historians, Mathias, Marc and Lucien - the three evangelists. They agree to dig around the tree and see if something has been buried there. They find nothing but soil.<br/><br/>A few weeks later, Sophia disappears and her body is found burned to ashes in a car. Who killed the opera singer? Her husband, her ex-lover, her best friend, her niece? They all seem to have a motive.<br/><br/>Vandoosler and the three evangelists set out to find the truth.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/51/9780099469551.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Three Evangelists', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.46958461806 Pounds, Width: 0.70866 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.70866}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.46958461806}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Fred Vargas'], 'title': 'The Three Evangelists', 'isbn13': '9780099469551', 'msrp': 10.54, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099469553', 'isbn10': '0099469553'}}
