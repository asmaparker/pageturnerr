{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "Billy Bartholomew has an audacious soul, and he knows it. Why? Because it's all he has left. He's dead.<br/>Eddie Proffit has an equally audacious soul, but he doesn't know it. He's still alive.<br/>These days, Billy and Eddie meet on the sledding hill, where they used to spend countless hours -- until Billy kicked a stack of Sheetrock over on himself, breaking his neck and effectively hitting tilt on his Earthgame. The two were inseparable friends. They still are. And Billy is not about to let a little thing like death stop him from hanging in there with Eddie in his epic struggle to get his life back on track.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/30/9780060502430.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Sledding Hill', 'edition': 'First Edition first Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.95 Pounds, Width: 0.85 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.85}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2005-05-10', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Boys & Men', 'Religious', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Chris Crutcher'], 'title': 'The Sledding Hill', 'isbn13': '9780060502430', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060502436', 'isbn10': '0060502436'}}
