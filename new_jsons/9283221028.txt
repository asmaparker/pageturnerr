{'book': {'publisher': 'Oxford University Press', 'synopsis': 'The "Cancer Incidence in Five Continents" series presents data on cancer incidence in a standardized format for every area in the world from which it is possible to obtain reliable figures. Volume V, published in 1987, included data from population based cancer registries covering 137 populations in 36 countries. The publication depicts the data published in Volume V in a graphic format. This form of presentation allows a more easy appreciation of the range and pattern of incidence internationally, and highlights the interesting variations for the different cancer sites. Histograms of the world standardized rates illustrate the range in incidence for 40 geographically representative populations by cancer site and by sex, with the addition of bars showing the highest and lowest rates for each site among all the populations included in Volume V. Pie charts show the proportions of the top ten cancer sites within each of the 137 populations in Volume V. A series of graphs for 24 populations show the different pattern of incidence by age for 47 cancer sites.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/29/9789283221029.jpg', 'title_long': 'Patterns of Cancer in Five Continents (Iarc Scientific Publication)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.69 Inches, Length: 8.31 Inches, Weight: 1.52 Pounds, Width: 0.471 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.471}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.52}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.69}}, 'pages': 188, 'date_published': '1990-12-27', 'subjects': ['Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['S.
