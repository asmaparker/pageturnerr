So what if she's been wearing it for five years -- and her classic, expensive, dull everyday outfits make her look like someone fatally allergic to a good time?<br/>What exactly is wrong with the girl?<br/>She's bored, for one thing. She's thirty years old and in a rut -- and best friend, Pam, thinks it's time Claudia got her freak on. It's time to inject a little action, adventure, and good old-fashioned lust into this sister's life.
