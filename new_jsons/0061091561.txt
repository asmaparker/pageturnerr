{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper', 'synopsis': "After turning a film student's directorial debut into a hit movie, New York mobster and movie fanatic Vinnie Callabrese takes off for the bright lights of Hollywood, where he begins a new life as Michael Vincent, Producer. A natural born wheeler-dealer, he lands not only a major studio deal, but also a gorgeous actress girlfriend.<br/>It isn't long before Michael Vincent is one of the most successful producers in town, given his knack for bringing in films under budget -- not too difficult when you're willing to lie, seduce, intimidate, and even kill to get what you want. But some of the people from his past have long memories and a far reach, and now it's Michael's turn to watch his back. Because even in the land of make-believe certain enemies -- and their bullets -- are very real.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/15/68/9780061091568.jpg', 'title_long': 'L.A.
