{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Ann Redding has taken every lousy thing life has thrown at her and handled it very well, thank you very much. All she wants is to get her life back on track. . . but that won\'t happen till she makes her worried family and friends back off by spending two weeks at Camp Kinsonu, a retreat for suddenly single women. Now she\'s stuck sitting around a campfire, singing "I Am Woman" with a bunch of sandal-clad, makeup-boycotting women. If she doesn\'t get out of there soon, they\'ll be sizing her for Birkenstocks.<br/>Kinsonu, an idyllic retreat on the coast of Maine, is supposed to be a place for new hope and new beginnings. But Ann doesn\'t belong in an estrogen Eden, she belongs in a corporate boardroom. Still, the camp has its compensations—she\'s grudgingly befriended some other "inmates," including Cindy, who honestly believes she\'s just killing time till her serial-cheating husband comes crawling back. And Martha, shy, overweight, and mysteriously silent about the man she\'s there to get over.<br/>Maybe it was fate that brought them together at Camp Kinsonu, maybe just bad luck. But three strangers are about to bond on an adventure they didn\'t ask for—and discover that lives they thought were as good as it got could suddenly get a lot better.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/63/9780061140563.jpg', 'title_long': 'As Good As It Got', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.53 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.53}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 301, 'date_published': '2008-06-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Friendship', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Isabel Sharpe'], 'title': 'As Good As It Got', 'isbn13': '9780061140563', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061983284'}, 'isbn': '0061140562', 'isbn10': '0061140562', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061983283', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
