{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': "With historical and multicultural sensitivity, this best-selling book probes the nature and causes of the major social changes confronting today's citizens. Using the latest research, current statistics, examples, charts, and tables, it delves into the social control and action issues inherent to each problem in a clear, easy-to-read format. Balancing viewpoints and supporting material with research and policy, the book covers topics in a micro-to-macro format, pointing out the interrelationships among today's social problems and approaching them from several perspectives. The first few chapters focus on individual behaviors such as drug use and crime. The middle chapters deal with inequality and discrimination, discussing such topics as poverty, prejudice, sexism, ageism, family life, and work. The final chapters discuss the problems of cities, environmental pollution, and war and terrorism: matters of global significance. Because the nature of the United States is changing, with health and health care crises, military invasions, economic downturn, shrinking public budgets and rising fiscal deficits, and environmental issues, this book becomes a necessary read for members of the medical profession that confront the tragedy of AIDS, law enforcement professionals who cope with crime and violence, elected officials and other political leaders who are expected to formulate sound social policies to address social problems, and citizens who wish to learn more about the social problems that are pervasive in our lives.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/20/9780131115620.jpg', 'title_long': 'Social Problems, 11th Edition', 'edition': '11', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 2.55 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.75}}, 'pages': 608, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['William Kornblum', 'Joseph Julian'], 'title': 'Social Problems, 11th Edition', 'isbn13': '9780131115620', 'msrp': 89.8, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0131115626', 'isbn10': '0131115626'}}
