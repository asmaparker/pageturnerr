Here\'s the all American brother and sister team. Look! It\'s Dick, in his striped polo shirts and shorts, always ready for an adventure. Look! Look! It\'s Jane, in her pretty dresses, eager to have fun and learn about life. There\'s silly, mischievous Baby Sally, and Spot, America\'s favorite spaniel. Growing Up with Dick and Jane brings to life the cast of characters who are emblems of the American Dream. And side by side with the story of Dick and Jane is an entertaining and informative text that tracks important historical, social and educational events of the "Dick and Jane era."<br/>Here\'s your chance to step back into the innocent watercolor world of Dick and Jane, where night never comes, knees never scrape, parents never yell and the fun never stops. Remember holding a Dick and Jane primer for the first time and the thrill you felt when you knew you could read? Growing Up with Dick and Jane traces the Dick and Jane phenomenon from their birth during the Depression to their retirement in the stormy 1960s. It explores the influence these little books had on education and the evolving American Dream.
