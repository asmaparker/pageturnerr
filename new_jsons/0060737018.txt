{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "Welcome to Echo Falls.Home of a thousand secrets, where Ingrid Levin-Hill, super sleuth, never knows what will happen next.<br/>Ingrid is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Or at least her shoes are. Getting them back means getting involved in a murder investigation rivaling those solved by her idol, Sherlock Holmes, and Ingrid has enough on her plate with club soccer, school, and the plum role of Alice in the Echo Falls production of Alice in Wonderland. But much as in Alice's adventures down the rabbit hole, things in Ingrid's small town keep getting curiouser and curiouser. Her favorite director has a serious accident onstage (but is it an accident?), and the police chief is on Ingrid's tail, grilling her about everything from bike-helmet law to the color of her cleats. Echo Falls has turned into a nightmare, and Ingrid is determined to wake up. Edgar Award?nominated novelist Peter Abrahams builds suspense as a smart young girl finds that her small town isn't nearly as safe as it seems.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/16/9780060737016.jpg', 'title_long': 'Down the Rabbit Hole: An Echo Falls Mystery (Echo Falls Mystery, 1)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 1.21 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.21}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-04-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Arts, Music & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Mysteries & Detectives'], 'authors': ['Peter Abrahams'], 'title': 'Down the Rabbit Hole: An Echo Falls Mystery (Echo Falls Mystery, 1)', 'isbn13': '9780060737016', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060737018', 'isbn10': '0060737018'}}
