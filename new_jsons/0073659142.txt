{'book': {'publisher': 'Irwin Professional Pub', 'synopsis': 'Steiner & Steiner, the leading Business & Society text, is about the interrelationships among business, government, and society and how they effect business managers. Managers steer companies through a world continuously altered by environmental forces that reshape the economic, cultural, political, technological and ecological terrain on which companies operate. Numerous stakeholders challenge traditional ideas about when corporations are being ethical and socially responsible. These two forces create a web of complex, challenging and threatening relationships for managers, both domestically and internationally. Four basic analytical approaches are presented as alternative ways of picturing the interrelationships: 1) Market Capitalism; 2) Dominance; 3) Dynamic Forces; 4) Stakeholder. The texts analytical models are as follows : 1) Focus on Strategic Management; 2) Interdisciplinary Approach with a Managerial Focus; 3) Comprehensive Scope; 4) Focus on Theory; 5) Historical Perspective; 6) Global Perspective.<br/>Steiner and Steiner, one of the first books in this course area, has benefited greatly from the reputation of its authors.
