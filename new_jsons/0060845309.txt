{'book': {'publisher': 'HarpPerenM', 'synopsis': "It's 1949, the era of the mambo, and two young Cuban musicians make their way from Havana to New York. The Castillo brothers, workers by day, become, by night, stars of the dance halls, where their orchestra plays the sensuous, pulsing music that earns them the title of the Mambo Kings. This is a golden time that thirty years later will be remembered with deep affection. In The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, Oscar Hijuelos has created an enthralling novel about passion and loss, memory and desire. This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/08/9780060845308.jpg', 'title_long': 'Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, The tie-in', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2005-07-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Oscar Hijuelos'], 'title': 'Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, The tie-in', 'isbn13': '9780060845308', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060845309', 'isbn10': '0060845309'}}
