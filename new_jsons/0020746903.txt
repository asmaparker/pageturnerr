{'book': {'publisher': 'Collier Books', 'synopsis': 'A classic that for over two decades has been hailed as the best general work on libertarianism available. Rothbard begins with a quick overview of its historical roots, and then goes on to define libertarianism as resting "upon one single axiom: that no man or group of men shall aggress upon the person or property of anyone else." He writes a withering critique of the chief violator of liberty: the State. Rothbard then provides penetrating libertarian solutions for many of today\'s most pressing problems, including poverty, war, threats to civil liberties, the education crisis, and more.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/04/9780020746904.jpg', 'title_long': 'For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto', 'edition': 'Revised', 'pages': 338, 'date_published': '1978', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'Political Science'], 'authors': ['Murray N.
