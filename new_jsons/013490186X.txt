{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': 'Designed for interest in engineering drawing, engineering graphics, and computer-aided drawing (cad). Based on a 3-d approach to design, this piece emphasizes how modeling is inherently different from 2-d cad. Beginning with a brief introduction to the design process in the context of concurrent engineering, this book proceeds to cover topics such as the i-deas work environment, file management, sketching, revolution, applying and modeling 3-d constraints, features and feature-based modeling, lofting, sweeping, and extracting data from 3-d models. Features/benefits each chapter includes a set of "guided tours" that walk users through features of i-deas. Encourages the reader "to learn by doing." chapters conclude with an ample number of drawing problems. Help reinforce topics from the chapter. Solid modeling with i-deas can be used on its own, or as a supplementary text to 3-d visualization for engineering graphics, or any other prentice hall graphics book.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/62/9780134901862.jpg', 'title_long': 'Solid Modeling with I-DEAS', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.25 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.25}}, 'pages': 234, 'date_published': '1999-03-01', 'subjects': ['Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Mechanical', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Shelby A.
