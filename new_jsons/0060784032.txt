{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon Books', 'synopsis': "He's at her service . . .<br/>Though she can't afford the coal to heat her drafty Mayfair mansion, Felicity Langley still clings to her dream of marrying a duke—one she's had since her very first curtsy. After all, she's been promised to the very lofty Duke of Hollindrake for the last four years. Now all she has to do is meet him. But what Felicity doesn't realize is that she has met her duke—he's the altogether too handsome man who Felicity has just mistaken . . . for her new footman!<br/>By rights, Thatcher should immediately set this presumptuous chit straight and tell her he has no intention of honoring the arranged betrothal. But he's quickly smitten by Felicity's delightful determination, her irrepressible charm . . . and her breathtaking sensuality. Yes, she'd wed him in an instant were his true identity revealed—but Thatcher's vowed to marry only for love. So begins his deception and his conquest of this uncommon woman who doesn't believe in romance, but is about to find her heart and passion set aflame by the unlikely man she's sworn to resist.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/34/9780060784034.jpg', 'title_long': 'Love Letters From a Duke Love Letters From a Duke', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.41005980732 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41005980732}}, 'pages': 370, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Elizabeth Boyle'], 'title': 'Love Letters From a Duke Love Letters From a Duke', 'isbn13': '9780060784034', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061747122', 'ePub': '0061747122'}, 'isbn': '0060784032', 'isbn10': '0060784032', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061747120', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
