{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Solid Acids and Bases: Their Catalytic Properties reviews developments in the studies of acidic and basic properties of solids, including the efficacy and special characteristics of solid acid and base catalysts. This book discusses the determination of basic and acidic properties on solid surfaces and relationship between acid strength and acid amount. The structure and acid-base properties of mixed metal oxides and correlation between acid-base properties and catalytic activity and selectivity are also deliberated. This publication is useful to professional chemists and graduate students in the fields of organic, inorganic and physical chemistry, petroleum chemistry and catalysis, including readers interested in the acidic and basic properties on solid surfaces.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/01/9780126832501.jpg', 'title_long': 'Solid Acids and Bases: Their Catalytic Properties', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.0802650838 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.0802650838}}, 'pages': 184, 'date_published': '1971-03-14', 'subjects': ['Inorganic', 'General', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Chemistry -> Inorganic Chemistry', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Chemistry -> General Chemistry'], 'authors': ['Kozo Tanabe'], 'title': 'Solid Acids and Bases: Their Catalytic Properties', 'isbn13': '9780126832501', 'msrp': 31.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0126832501', 'isbn10': '0126832501', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780323160582', 'binding': 'eisbn'}]}}
