{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt Rinehart and Winston', 'synopsis': 'Is antisemitism on the rise in America? A glance at the daily newspapers suggests a resurgence of animosity, yet Leonard Dinnerstein, in this provocative and in-depth study, categorically states that there is less bigotry in this country than ever before. He also argues in this provocative analysis that Jews have never been more at home in America. What we are seeing today, he writes, is media hype. A long tradition of prejudice, suspicion, and hatred against the Jews, the direct product of Christian teachings, has, in fact, finally begun to wane.<br/><br/>In Antisemitism in America, Dinnerstein provides a landmark work - the first comprehensive history of prejudice against Jews in the United States, ranging from its foundations in European Christian culture to the present day.<br/><br/>Dinnerstein\'s richly detailed and thoroughly documented book reveals how Christians carried their religious prejudices with them to the New World and how they manifested themselves, albeit in muted form, in the colonial wilderness and in the developing American society thereafter. Jews could not vote, for example, in Rhode Island or New Hampshire until 1842, and in North Carolina until 1868. The Civil War witnessed the first major wave of publicly displayed American antisemitism as individuals in both the North and the South assumed that Jews sided with the enemy. The decades that followed marked the emergence of a full-fledged antisemitic society as Christians excluded Jews from their social circles and wove fantasies for themselves as they pictured what "Jews were really like."<br/><br/>Antisemitic fervor mixed with racism at the beginning of the twentieth century, accelerated by the views of eugenicists, fears of Bolshevism, andthe rantings of Henry Ford. During the Depression hostility toward Jews accelerated as Americans vented their frustrations upon minorities because of the economic crises of the decade. Christians of all stripes called upon Jews to accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, and Father Charles Coughlin emerged as one of the most beloved priests in all of American history as he excoriated Jews and sympathized with Nazis over the airwaves and in his journal, Social Justice.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/31/9780030833731.jpg', 'title_long': 'Antisemitism in the United States (His Sounds of Language Readers)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.45 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}}, 'pages': 140, 'date_published': '1971-01', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Leonard Dinnerstein'], 'title': 'Antisemitism in the United States (His Sounds of Language Readers)', 'isbn13': '9780030833731', 'msrp': 5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0030833736', 'isbn10': '0030833736'}}
