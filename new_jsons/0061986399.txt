So desperate to save her sick child, she's willing to make a deal with the Devil: steal a ring worn by Finn Payne, the bad-boy rockstar who long ago sold his soul for rock 'n roll. Temptation and seduction become necessary evils, yet Faith's salvation means Finn's damnation . . . because the ring is all that stands between him and Hell. Falling in love was never part of the bargain, but now that they've tasted heaven in each other's arms, can they convince the Devil to give up his due?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/90/9780061986390.jpg', 'title_long': "Devil Without a Cause (Devil's Bargain, Book 1)", 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.4188782978 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4188782978}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2011-05-31', 'subjects': ['Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Gothic'], 'authors': ['Terri Garey'], 'title': "Devil Without a Cause (Devil's Bargain, Book 1)", 'isbn13': '9780061986390', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061986399', 'isbn10': '0061986399'}}
