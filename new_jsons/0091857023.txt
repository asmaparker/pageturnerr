{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House', 'synopsis': "Tracy Hogg knows babies. She can calm even the most distressed or difficult infant, because she understands their language. Hence, her clients call her 'The Baby Whisperer'. Her incredible sensitivity and ability to read infants' cries, coos and assorted baby noises quickly earned Tracy the admiration and gratitude of high-profile couples, including a host of celebrities. In this remarkable book, Tracy demystifies the magic she has performed with some five thousand babies. She teaches parents how to work out what kind of baby they have, what kind of mother and father they are, and what kind of parenting plan will work best for them. Believing that babies need to become part of the family - rather than dominate it - she has developed a practical programme that works with infants as young as a day old. Her methods are also applauded by 'Tracy's is a voice that should be heard. She appears very knowledgeable about modern infant research and has incorporated this to a level parents can understand. In spite of all the baby how-tos on the market, this one will stand out.'", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/70/28/9780091857028.jpg', 'title_long': 'Secrets of the Baby Whisperer : How to Calm, Connect and Communicate With Your Baby', 'edition': '1st UK Paperback Edi', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.21258 Inches, Length: 6.02361 Inches, Weight: 0.81350574678 Pounds, Width: 0.86614 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.02361}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86614}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.81350574678}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.21258}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Parenting & Relationships', 'Parenting', 'Early Childhood'], 'authors': ['Ph.
