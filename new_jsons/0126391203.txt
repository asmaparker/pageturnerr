{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Pr', 'synopsis': 'Volcanic Activity and Human Ecology deals with dating, chronology, stratigraphy, volcanic activity, and with the impacts of volcanism on animals, plants, human populations, and the environment. Some of the chapters explain how such findings must be weighed against other causes that influence human behavior and survival, such as factors of social customs, climatic change, shifting biogeographic patterns, disease, and the ability to adapt. Each of the chapters that assess the possible human response to volcanism does so by searching for multiple explanations of the archaeological record, avoiding the simple argument that people were dramatically and inevitably overcome by catastrophic geologic events. The book begins with discussions of volcanism as seen by geologists and pedologists. These include s a general overview of volcanoes and volcanism; a review of the production, dispersal, and properties of tephra and of the geologic methods used to study tephra; and the nature of volcanic soils and their economic impact. Subsequent chapters use the geologic and modern records to examine volcanoes as hazards to people. The final series of papers deals with the interrelationships between volcanism and human occupations as seen through the archaeological, paleobotanical, and paleozoological records.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/06/9780126391206.jpg', 'title_long': 'Volcanic Activity and Human Ecology', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 2.5573622392 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.5573622392}}, 'pages': 660, 'date_published': '1980', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Payson D.
