{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "What goes around comes around . . .<br/>When the body of high-priced call girl Ginger Pass is found dead on a path outside the summer retreat of the most exclusive men's club in California, the other members of her self-help group—Polly, Kat, Charlotte, Dinah, and Justine—are convinced it was foul play. Now they have to find a way to prove it.<br/>Their amateur sleuthing leads them to a trio of rich, powerful men: a politician running on a platform of family values, a divorce lawyer with a trophy wife, and a developer with an unhealthy predilection for expensive art. Hidden behind walls of money, connections, and respectability, these men seem to be untouchable. But little do they know of the plans being set in motion to strike them where it really hurts—in the most private aspects of their lives.<br/>Like Robin Hood's merry men, King Arthur's knights, and the Girl Scouts rolled into one, the adventurous and brave quintet of women will risk everything to bring down the men they believe caused their friend's death. The women know the consequences if they fail. But they don't count on what will happen to their lives if they succeed.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/15/9780061137815.jpg', 'title_long': 'What Goes Around: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition first Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2007-04-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', "Women's Adventure", 'United States', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime'], 'authors': ['Susan Diamond'], 'title': 'What Goes Around: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780061137815', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061137812', 'isbn10': '0061137812'}}
