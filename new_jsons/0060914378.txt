{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Cookbooks', 'synopsis': "The Hungarians, a fierce and proud people, take particular pride in their unique cuisine, which is on a par with the world's finest. It is basically straightforward and simple, its ingredients, for the most part, easily available and its techniques not hard to master. In its imaginative use of meats, vegetables, and grains, and in its special seasonings, it offers the American cook--whether novice or accomplished--a welcome and exhilarating change. A whole new range of flavors and combinations becomes available to the adventurous cook in Susan Derecskey's fine collection of recipes. They include, of course, such classics as goulash and chicken paprikash, but far more unusual and exotic ways to prepare beef and pork and poultry and lamb are detailed. Dumplings and noodles for wonderful soups are easier to make than you might expect, and the many ways of preparing all kinds of vegetables will astonish you. Desserts are superlative and addicting. Suggestions for complete menus and the wines to accompany them add to the book's usefulness.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/70/9780060914370.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Hungarian Cookbook', 'edition': '60th ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.91271376468 Pounds, Width: 0.63 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.63}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91271376468}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1987-10-14', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Regional & International', 'European', 'Comfort Food'], 'authors': ['Susan Derecskey'], 'title': 'The Hungarian Cookbook', 'isbn13': '9780060914370', 'msrp': 19.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060914378', 'isbn10': '0060914378'}}
