{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': 'Celebrated sports journalist Robert Lipsyte—the New York Times’ longtime lead sports columnist—mines pure gold from his long and very eventful career to bring readers a memoir like no other. An enthralling book, as much about personal relationships and the culture of sports as the athletes and teams themselves, An Accidental Sportswriter interweaves stories from Lipsyte’s life and the events he covered to explore the connections between the games we play and the lives we lead. Robert Lipsyte has been there—from the Mets’ first Spring Training to the fight that made Muhammad Ali an international icon to the current steroids scandals that rewired our view of sports—and in An Accidental Sportswriter he offers a fresh and refreshing view of the world of professional athletes as seen through the eyes of a journalist who always managed to remain independent of our jock-obsessed culture.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/39/9780061769139.jpg', 'title_long': 'An Accidental Sportswriter: A Memoir', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Width: 0.89 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.89}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2011-05-03', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Journalists', 'History', 'Americas', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Miscellaneous', 'History of Sports', 'Journalism', 'Sociology of Sports', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Robert Lipsyte'], 'title': 'An Accidental Sportswriter: A Memoir', 'isbn13': '9780061769139', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061769134', 'isbn10': '0061769134'}}
