{'book': {'publisher': 'Macmillan Reference USA', 'synopsis': 'Genocide: the systematic annihilation of a group of people for simply being who they are, whether in ethnic, religious or social terms. It has been with us since the beginning of history. The most widely-studied and catastrophic examples are, however, historically close: the Nazi Holocaust against the Jew, ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and tribal warfare in Rwanda. Genocide is unfortunately a key feature of the study of world history at nearly every level. The Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity spans the globe to explain the issues behind crimes against humanity and human rights issues as they relate to individual countries and the world at large. It traces the history of events that qualify as genocide and crimes against humanity, profiles perpetrators and heroes, and explains international laws and law proceedings aimed at ending genocide and crimes against humanity at specific groups or at least punishing those who have committed such crimes.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/76/9780028658476.jpg', 'title_long': 'Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity - 3 Volume Set (T-Z-Index)', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.4 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 10.80926470586 Pounds, Width: 8.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 10.80926470586}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.4}}, 'pages': 1500, 'date_published': '2004-10-29', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Military', 'Law', 'Foreign & International Law', 'Reference', 'Encyclopedias & Subject Guides', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology', 'Demography', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Dinah Shelton'], 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity - 3 Volume Set (T-Z-Index)', 'isbn13': '9780028658476', 'msrp': 720, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0028658477', 'isbn10': '0028658477'}}
