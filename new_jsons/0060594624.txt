{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'Samantha Ranvali can\'t sleep. Haunted by nightmares and the memory of a man who attacked her years ago, she seeks a cure for her insomnia through an experimental study called "Endymion\'s Circle." The treatment seems to be a success, but after her first full night of sleep in months, Samantha learns that one of the other participants in the study has been murdered. The body is found crucified upside down, and a recording of J. S. Bach\'s "Goldberg Variations" plays at the scene. As an old lover investigates the crime, he draws Samantha into a mystery that spans over two hundred years and suggests something far more sinister than the police expect. And with each night of Samantha\'s newfound sleep, she awakens to another ritualistic crime. Every clue takes her deeper into her own past, her own history of loss, pain, and desperation. Every murder reveals that a dark curse has taken hold of her world. And every clue brings her closer to the revelation that she is the next victim. Here is stunning suspense that plays masterfully with the conventions of the genre and perfectly blends historical richness with modern-day terror.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/26/9780060594626.jpg', 'title_long': 'Night Visions: A Novel of Suspense', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.51 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.51}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2004-11-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors': ['Thomas Fahy'], 'title': 'Night Visions: A Novel of Suspense', 'isbn13': '9780060594626', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061750794'}, 'isbn': '0060594624', 'isbn10': '0060594624', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061750793', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
