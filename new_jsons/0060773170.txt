{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "What is Clare Wingate doing? One minute she's suffering in a pretty-in-pink gown she'll never wear again, and the next thing she knows it's morning . . . and she has the nastiest hangover of her life.<br/>To make matters worse, she's wearing nothing but a spritz of Escada and lying next to Sebastian Vaughan . . . her girlhood crush turned sexy, globe-hopping journalist. Somewhere between the toast and the toss of the bouquet she'd gotten herself into a whole lot of trouble.<br/>Clare had the right to go wild—after all, she'd been knocked off her dyed-to-match shoes after finding her own fiancé in a compromising position with the washing machine repairman. Clearly her society wedding is off.<br/>But Sebastian pushed all the wrong buttons—and some of the right ones, too. Clare is in no mood for love—not even for lust—and wants to forget about Sebastian and his six-pack abs ASAP. But he isn't in the mood to go away, and his kiss is impossible to forget.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/75/9780060773175.jpg', 'title_long': "I'm In No Mood For Love (Writer Friends, 2)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.42 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.42}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006-09-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Rachel Gibson'], 'title': "I'm In No Mood For Love (Writer Friends, 2)", 'isbn13': '9780060773175', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061796697', 'ePub': '0061796697'}, 'isbn': '0060773170', 'isbn10': '0060773170', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061796692', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
