{'book': {'publisher': 'R & S Books', 'synopsis': 'From School Library Journal<br/><br/>PreSchool-Grade 2-In the wee hours of the night, Rabbit misses his daddy. He checks in all the usual spots, but can\'t find him anywhere. Little Sister wakes up and is ready for a hide-and-seek adventure. Thinking maybe their father went to buy carrots, the buck-toothed pair gather their courage and look outside. When the front door locks behind them, they call for help, And since no one could scream louder than Little Sister, it sounded pretty impressive. Daddy emerges from the basement, surprised that his whole family is awake. Gimbergsson\'s pen-and-watercolor illustrations are bathed in a shadowy blue wash and capture Rabbit\'s droll expressions and Little Sister\'s poses. Children will enjoy the comical elements in this bedtime slice-of-life scenario, such as the witty repartee between the siblings, Mommy\'s rumpled appearance, and Daddy\'s restless insomnia.-Linda Ludke, London Public Library, Ontario, Canada<br/>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
