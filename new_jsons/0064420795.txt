{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': 'When Bob the dolphin was born, he was small and sickly, with an unusual comet-shaped mark on his drooping dorsal fin. No one at the aquarium expected him to survive. But like his mother, Aster, Bob was ornery, and he stubbornly struggled to overcome his health problems. And soon, he loved to leap high into the air and perform tricks.<br/>Then one day, Bob taught himself a new trick-and jumped into more trouble than any other dolphin in the history of the aquarium. With a dolphin like Bob around, you never know what will happen!', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/92/9780064420792.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Dolphin Named Bob (Trophy Chapter Books (Paperback))', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.62 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.13448197982 Pounds, Width: 0.16 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.16}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.13448197982}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.62}}, 'pages': 80, 'date_published': '1998-04-04', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Marine Life', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Chapter Books & Readers', 'Action & Adventure', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Hunting & Fishing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Twig C George'], 'title': 'A Dolphin Named Bob (Trophy Chapter Books (Paperback))', 'isbn13': '9780064420792', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0064420795', 'isbn10': '0064420795'}}
