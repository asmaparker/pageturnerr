{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'Exploring Engineering: An Introduction to Engineering and Design, Second Edition, provides an introduction to the engineering profession. It covers both classical engineering and emerging fields, such as bioengineering, nanotechnology, and mechatronics.  <br>The book is organized into two parts. Part 1 provides an overview of the engineering discipline. It begins with a discussion of what engineers do and then covers topics such as the key elements of engineering analysis; problems solving and spreadsheet analyses; and the kinds, conversion, and conservation of energy. The book also discusses key concepts drawn from the fields of chemical engineering; mechanical engineering; electrical engineering; electrochemical engineering; materials engineering; civil engineering; engineering kinematics; bioengineering; manufacturing engineering; and engineering economics. Part 2 focuses on the steps in the engineering design process. It provides content for a Design Studio, where students can design and build increasingly complex engineering system. It also presents examples of design competitions and concludes with brief remarks about the importance of design projects.<br><br><ul><li>Organized in two parts to cover both the concepts and practice of engineering: Part I, Minds On, introduces the\xa0 fundamental physical, chemical and material bases for all engineering work while Part II, Hands On, provides opportunity to do design projects</li> <p><li>An Engineering Ethics Decision Matrix is introduced in Chapter 1 and used throughout the book to pose ethical challenges and explore ethical decision-making in an engineering context</li> <p><li>Lists of "Top Engineering Achievements" and "Top Engineering Challenges" help put the material in context and show engineering as a vibrant discipline involved in solving societal problems New to this edition:</li> <p><li>Additional discussions on what engineers do, and the distinctions between engineers, technicians, and managers (Chapter 1)</li> <p><li>\xa0New coverage of Renewable Energy and Environmental Engineering helps emphasize the emerging interest in Sustainable Engineering</li> <p><li>New discussions of Six Sigma in the Design section, and expanded material on writing technical reports</li> <p><li>Re-organized and updated chapters in Part I to more closely align with specific engineering disciplines</li> </ul> <p>new end of chapter excercises throughout the book </p>', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/62/9780080884462.jpg', 'title_long': 'Exploring Engineering: An Introduction to Engineering and Design', 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'ePub', 'pages': 464, 'date_published': '2009', 'subjects': ['Mechanical', 'Engineering (General)', 'Industrial Engineering', 'Professional, Career & Trade -> Engineering -> General Engineering', 'Trades & Technology -> Industrial Technology -> Mechanical', '034', '330', 'cs.eng', 'Trades & Technology -> Industrial Engineering -> Industrial Engineering'], 'authors': ['Philip Kosky', 'Robert T.
