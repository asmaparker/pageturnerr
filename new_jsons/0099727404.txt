And the very avoidance results in greater pain and an inability to grow both mentally and spiritually.<br/><br/>Drawing heavily on his own professional experience, leading psychiatrist Dr M. Scott Peck suggests ways in which facing our difficulties- and suffering through the changes- can enable us to reach a higher level of self-understanding.
