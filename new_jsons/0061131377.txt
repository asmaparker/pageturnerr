{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "How can a beautiful white elephant be a terrible curse?<br/>Run-Run, a young elephant trainer, discovers the answer when he incurs the fury of the prince. The boy's punishment? The gift of an elephant, white as a cloud. From that moment forward, the curse reveals itself. According to tradition, so rare an elephant cannot be allowed to work for its keep. It is poor Run-Run who must feed the beast the hundreds of pounds of food it eats each day, and scrub it clean, and brush its pom-pom of a tail, and wash behind its ears, and, above all, keep it from doing any work.<br/>Oh, if only Run-Run could make the magnificent white elephant disappear! Clever as a magician, he doesâ€”but the curse has tricks of its own for Run-Run.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/70/9780061131370.jpg', 'title_long': 'The White Elephant', 'edition': 'Library Bound Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.53}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 112, 'date_published': '2006-10-17', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Elephants', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Sid Fleischman'], 'title': 'The White Elephant', 'isbn13': '9780061131370', 'msrp': 16.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0061131377', 'isbn10': '0061131377'}}
