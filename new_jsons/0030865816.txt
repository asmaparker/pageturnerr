{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt, Rinehart and Winston', 'synopsis': "Suspect Tenderness opens with a narrative concerning the capture of Daniel Berrigan, related in his continuing friendship and pastoral relationship with Stringfellow and co-author Anthony Towne. It continues with an examination of the ethical and theological implications of the Berrigan witness, in which middle-class American piety is asked to face the fact that Jesus was a criminal. Stringfellow insists that every state feels threatened by Christ's claim to a moral authority over death, and sees the community of resistance as a community of resurrection.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/17/9780030865817.jpg', 'title_long': 'Suspect tenderness;: The ethics of the Berrigan witness,', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'xiii, 177 p. 22 cm.', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 431}}, 'pages': 177, 'date_published': '1971', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['William Stringfellow'], 'title': 'Suspect tenderness;: The ethics of the Berrigan witness,', 'isbn13': '9780030865817', 'msrp': 85.87, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0030865816', 'isbn10': '0030865816'}}
