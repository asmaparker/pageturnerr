{'book': {'publisher': 'Mariner Books', 'synopsis': "Pagan Babies is classic crime fiction from the master of suspense, New York Times bestselling author Elmore Leonard.<br/>Father Terry Dunn thought he'd seen everything on the mean streets of Detroit, but that was before he went on a little retreat to Rwanda to evade a tax-fraud indictment. Now the whiskey-drinking, Nine Inch Nails T-shirt-wearing padre is back trying to hustle up a score to help the little orphans of Rwanda.<br/>But the fund-raising gets complicated when a former tattletale cohort pops up on Terry's tail. And then there's the lovely Debbie Dewey. A freshly sprung ex-con turned stand-up comic, Debbie needs some fast cash, too, to settle an old score. Now they're in together for a bigger payoff than either could finagle alone. After all, it makes sense...unless Father Terry is working a con of his own.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/72/9780060008772.jpg', 'title_long': 'Pagan Babies', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.440924524}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2002-01-08', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Elmore Leonard'], 'title': 'Pagan Babies', 'isbn13': '9780060008772', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060008776', 'isbn10': '0060008776'}}
