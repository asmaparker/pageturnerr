{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': '<p>This New York Times Notable Book is a stunning story of sexual and spiritual awakening.</p><br/><p>Few women do it and even fewer will admit to it. But in Toni Bentley\'s daring and intimate memoir, The Surrender, she pulls the sheets back on an erotic experience that\'s been forbidden since the Bible and celebrates "the joy that lies on the other side of convention, where risk is real and rapture resides." From Story of O to The Kiss to The Sexual Life of Catherine M, readers have been enthralled with sexually subversive memoirs by women. But even those erotic classics didn\'t navigate the psychosexual terrain that Bentley does when she meets a lover who introduces her to a radical and unexpected pleasure, to the "holy" act that she came to see as her awakening.</p><br/><p>The Surrender is a witty, intelligent, and eloquent exploration of one woman\'s obsession that will be sure to leave readers questioning their own desires.</p>', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/62/9780060732462.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Surrender: An Erotic Memoir', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.81}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Sex', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Dancers', 'Specific Groups', 'Women', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Sexual Health', 'General'], 'authors': ['Toni Bentley'], 'title': 'The Surrender: An Erotic Memoir', 'isbn13': '9780060732462', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060732466', 'isbn10': '0060732466'}}
