{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTorch', 'synopsis': "California Homicide Detective Tom McMichael has every good reason to pass on the investigation of slain city patriarch Pete Braga. After all, it was former mayor and self-made millionaire Braga who killed Tom's grandfather in a dispute over money -- and Tom's own father who, allegedly, sought revenge by savagely beating Braga's son into imbecility. But there are others who hated the old man as well. And McMichael is a good cop determined to perform his duty to the best of his abilities -- despite his growing feelings for the beautiful nurse who is the prime suspect in the brutal bludgeoning death ... and despite a twisting trail that is leading him into deadly, dark, and very private places where he dearly wishes not to go.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/78/9780060593278.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cold Pursuit', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.08 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.08}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2004-09-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Small Town & Rural', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['T.
