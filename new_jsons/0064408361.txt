{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "Was Columbus the first European in the Americas?<br/>What sport became more popular after the Civil War?<br/>Were the Little Rock Nine a rock-and-roll band?<br/>As best-selling author Kenneth C. Davis knows, history can be fun, fascinating, and memorable. When his don't know much aboutÂ® history was published in 1990, it was a sensation. The book delivered a fresh take on history with its wit and unusual detail. Davis now does for young people what his earlier book did for adults. In his trademark question-and-answer style -- peppered with surprising facts, historic reproductions, and Matt Faulkner's lively illustrations -- Davis introduces our ancestors who settled the East and expanded the West, as well as those who had been living here all along. His sure touch brings the drama and excitement of the American story vividly to life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/63/9780064408363.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dont Know Much About American History By Davis Kenneth C Faulkner Matt ILT', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.54 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.56}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.54}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'History', 'United States', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Education & Reference', 'Reference', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World', 'Multicultural Stories', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Puzzles & Games', 'Trivia', 'Americas', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'Science & Math', 'Astronomy & Space Science', 'Astronomy', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science'], 'authors': ['Kenneth C Davis'], 'title': 'Dont Know Much About American History By Davis Kenneth C Faulkner Matt ILT', 'isbn13': '9780064408363', 'msrp': 6.29, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0064408361', 'isbn10': '0064408361'}}
