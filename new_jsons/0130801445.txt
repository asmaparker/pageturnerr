In this revised edition—with two new chapters and added tales from vision questers—Steven Foster recounts his experiences guiding contemporary seekers. He recreates an ancient rite of passage—that of “dying,” “passing through,” and “being reborn”—known as a vision quest. A sacred ceremony that culminates in a three-day, three-night fast, alone, in a place of natural power, the vision quest is a mystical, practical, and intensely personal journey of self-knowledge.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/49/9780130801449.jpg', 'title_long': 'The book of the vision quest: Personal transformation in the wilderness', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.68122838958 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.68122838958}}, 'pages': 230, 'date_published': '1988', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['Steven Foster'], 'title': 'The book of the vision quest: Personal transformation in the wilderness', 'isbn13': '9780130801449', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0130801445', 'isbn10': '0130801445'}}
