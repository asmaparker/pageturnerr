Can a self-made man overcome humble beginnings to romance the lady of his dreams?<br/>Surviving against all odds, Amyas St. Ives grew up in a foundling home, then escaped to the streets of London and managed, through sheer will and courage, to make his fortune. However, money and devastatingly good looks alone are not enough to gain entry into London high society—not when Amyas is unaware of his true origins and is considered base-born among the posh Regency set. When he meets the alluring Amber, a fellow foundling and ward of a respectable family, he thinks he's met a kindred spirit—but when Amber finally discovers her true identity, the hurdles to their love become insurmountable. How can Amyas convince her family that what a man is matters more than what he was born to be?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/71/25/9780060567125.jpg', 'title_long': 'Alas, My Love', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2005-03-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Victorian', '20th Century', 'Regency', 'Western'], 'authors': ['Edith Layton'], 'title': 'Alas, My Love', 'isbn13': '9780060567125', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061738816'}, 'isbn': '0060567120', 'isbn10': '0060567120', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061738814', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
