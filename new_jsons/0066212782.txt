Now, in The Great American Sex Diet, Laura adds a powerful new ingredient based on a discovery that grew out of a personal crisis in her life. Its effect was truly miraculous. In fact, it saved her relationship. But would it work for others?<br/>To find out, Laura invited thirty-eight couples to test her new recipe. They came from all across America and all walks of life -- twentysomethings to sixtysomethings, with children and without. Some were perfectly happy and looking for a way to spice things up, some yearned for the passion they once felt for one another, others were stressed out or had little or no desire for sex, and a few were even on the verge of breaking up. Most confessed that sex was now infrequent and predictable, but they all had this in common: They wanted to make things better.<br/>For twenty-eight amazing, eye-opening days, they explored the sealed pages in this book and followed Laura's secret recipes. They seduced each other. They surprised each other. They courted each other. And the sex they had was more incredible, wonderful, and breathtaking than they'd had in years. The results were extraordinary. All the successful couples had proven the truth behind Laura Corn's newest insight. Men and women felt better, they listened more, they treated each other with tenderness and respect. In short, they fell in love all over again.<br/>You'll be inspired by their tales of transformation.
