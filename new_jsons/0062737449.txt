{'book': {'publisher': 'Collins Reference', 'synopsis': "Learn from FeederWatcher Experts How to Feed and Attract Birds<br/>Join Margaret Barker on a fascinating tour of FeederWatcher's backyards and bird feeders. Margaret captures the joy in the FeederWatcher's words as they explain how to attract the finches you've seen down the road, how to discourage the flock of Starlings you'd really rather went elsewhere, and how to live peacefully with squirrels and raccoons. You'll discover which birds you can attract and which ones will return year after year.<br/>Each winter thousands of FeederWatchers identify birds attracted to their yards and record data about them. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology compiles the data into the largest existing database on backyard birds. No one has more hard facts on backyard birds than the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and no one knows more about attracting birds than the FeederWatchers.<br/>FeederWatchers are participants in Project FeederWatch, a joint research and education project of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the National Audubon Society, Bird Studies Canada, and the Canadian Nature Federation.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/41/9780062737441.jpg', 'title_long': "The FeederWatcher's Guide to Bird Feeding", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.79 Inches, Length: 8.26 Inches, Weight: 1.27 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.26}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.44}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.27}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.79}}, 'pages': 136, 'date_published': '2000-12-05', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Birdwatching', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Field Guides', 'Birds'], 'authors': ['Jack Griggs', 'Margaret A.
