{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': "In these stories lives come into focus through single events or sudden memories which bring the past bubbling to the surface. The past, as Alice Munro's characters discover, is made up not only of what is remembered, but also what isn't. The past is there, just out of the picture, but if memories haven't been savoured, recalled in the mind and boxed away, it's as if they have never been - until a moment when the pieces of the jigsaw re-form suddenly, sometimes pleasurably but more often painfully. Women look back at their young selves, at first marriages made when they were naive and trusting, at husbands and their difficult, demanding little ways.<br/><br/>There is in this new collection an underlying heartbreak, a sense of regret in her characters for what might have been, for a fork in the road not taken, a memory suppressed in an act of prudent emotional housekeeping. But at the same time there is hope, there are second chances - here are people who reinvent themselves, seize life by the throat, who have moved on and can dare to conjure up the hidden memories, daring to go beyond what is remembered.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/47/9780099422747.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.874 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Weight: 0.52249556094 Pounds, Width: 0.7874 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1181}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7874}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.52249556094}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.874}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories'], 'authors': ['Alice Munro'], 'title': 'Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage', 'isbn13': '9780099422747', 'msrp': 19.75, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0099422743', 'isbn10': '0099422743'}}
