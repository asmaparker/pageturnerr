{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Do our dogs experience the equivalent of infancy and puberty? Do they go through the terrible teens or struggle with midlife crises? And what can we do to ensure they take each step in stride? In The Seven Ages of Man's Best Friend, best-selling author Jan Fennell leads us through the key phases of a dog's development by uniquely defining the seven ages of our dogs. In a fresh, new approach to the subject, Jan charts a dog's life in stages: the buoyant, boundless energy of the Puppy and the Pioneer, the troublesome teens that are the ages of the Playboy and the Protégé, the difficult middle years of the Pretender and the Protector, and the twilight years of the Pensioner.<br/>The book works as a comprehensive guide to coping with the problems that crop up at particular times in a dog's development, including training and vaccinations as well as puberty and parenthood.<br/>In The Dog Listener, Jan Fennell changed the way we think about our dogs. Now, in her most important book since, Jan once more challenges conventional thinking and puts forward an alternative view of the dog's world. It is a book you will want to read straight through -- then keep close at hand for years.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/94/9780060822194.jpg', 'title_long': "The Seven Ages of Man's Best Friend: A Comprehensive Guide for Caring for Your Dog Through All the Stages of Life", 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2006-02-07', 'subjects': ['Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Dogs'], 'authors': ['Jan Fennell'], 'title': "The Seven Ages of Man's Best Friend: A Comprehensive Guide for Caring for Your Dog Through All the Stages of Life", 'isbn13': '9780060822194', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060822198', 'isbn10': '0060822198'}}
