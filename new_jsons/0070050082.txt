{'book': {'publisher': 'McGraw-Hill College', 'synopsis': 'This text,designed for a course in College Algebra,has been written to maximize student comprehension. Great care has been taken to write a book that is mathematically correct and accessible to students. Emphasis is on computational skills,ideas,and problem solving rather than mathematical theory. Most derivations and proofs are omitted except where their inclusion adds significant insight into a particular concept. General concepts and results are usually presented only after particular cases have been discussed. The single most crucial topic is function. The function concept is introduced and developed from several points of view and is substantially motivated through many illustrations and examples. One of the primary objectives of this book is to give the student substantial experience in modeling and solving real world problems. Enough applications are included to convince even the most skeptical student that mathematics really is useful.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/82/9780070050082.jpg', 'title_long': 'College Algebra', 'edition': 'Signed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 2.1495070545 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.1495070545}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '1993', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Mathematics', 'Pure Mathematics', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Raymond A.
