{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'When Constance Young, the undisputed star of morning television, is found dead at the bottom of her swimming pool, her colleague Eliza Blake is shocked. Determined to discover who wanted Constance out of the way—and why—she enlists the aid of three coworkers: Annabelle Murphy, who can switch from producing to sleuthing at a moment\'s notice; cameraman extraordinaire B.J. D\'Elia to add brains, brawn, and a much-needed male perspective to the team; and Dr. Margo Gonzalez, on-air psychiatrist, who understands the complex puzzles of the human mind. Calling themselves the "Sunrise Suspense Society," they set out to get to the bottom of the heinous murder, in a case that will test their ingenuity and their courage to the very limits.<br/>The only sure thing is that Constance Young made a lot of enemies—and now one of them is Eliza\'s enemy as well. And the closer she and the Society get to unmasking the murderer, the less chance they have of making it through each night alive . . .', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/87/9780061286087.jpg', 'title_long': 'When Day Breaks (Key News Thrillers, 10)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-07-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Romance', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Mary Jane Clark'], 'title': 'When Day Breaks (Key News Thrillers, 10)', 'isbn13': '9780061286087', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061851922'}, 'isbn': '0061286087', 'isbn10': '0061286087', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061851926', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
