{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Living a dog's life...now and then.<br/>Anna O'Shea has failed at marriage, shed her job at a law firm, and she's trying to re-create herself when she and her recalcitrant nephew are summoned to the past in a manner that nearly destroys them. Her twenty-first-century skills pale as she struggles to find her nephew in nineteenth-century Ireland. For one of them, the past is brutally difficult, filled with hunger and struggle. For the other, the past is filled with privilege, status, and a reprieve from the crushing pain of present-day life. For both Anna and her nephew, the past offers them a chance at love.<br/>Will every choice they make reverberate down through time? And do Irish Wolfhounds carry the soul of the ancient celts?<br/>The past and present wrap around finely wrought characters who reveal the road home. Mystical, charming, and fantastic, New York Times bestselling author Jacqueline Sheehan's Now & Then is a poignant and beautiful tale of a remarkable journey. It is a miraculous evocation of a breathtaking place in a volatile age filled with rich, unforgettable, deeply human characters and one unforgettable dog named Madigan.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/77/82/9780061547782.jpg', 'title_long': 'Now & Then', 'edition': 'Original', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.67020527648 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.67020527648}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 386, 'date_published': '2009-06-23', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Domestic Life', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Time Travel'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Now & Then', 'isbn13': '9780061547782', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061885797'}, 'isbn': '0061547786', 'isbn10': '0061547786', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061885792', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
