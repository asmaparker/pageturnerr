Would we welcome that visitor's presence and views? Are we ready for such an open exchange? Weaving together science fiction, spirituality, and philosophy with wisdom, humor, and plain common sense, Dyer tells the story of two peaceful beings from different worlds who work together to enhance the well-being of all. The gifts that Eykis, an alien traveling from a distant, Earth-like planet, brings to the people of Earth help them see themselves in a new light, and compel them to rethink their negative actions. Her insightful offerings will move you to new emotions, new behaviors, and a new understanding of humankind's limitless possibilities.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/45/9780060938345.jpg', 'title_long': 'Gifts from Eykis : A Story of Self-Discovery', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.43 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.43}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2002-01-08', 'subjects': ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['Wayne W Dyer'], 'title': 'Gifts from Eykis : A Story of Self-Discovery', 'isbn13': '9780060938345', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0062013084'}, 'isbn': '006093834X', 'isbn10': '006093834X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062013088', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
