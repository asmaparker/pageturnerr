He sleeps all day . . . which would be annoying except he's so attentive at night.<br/>2. He's attacked by sword-wielding assailants, yet insists he can handle it on his own.<br/>3. He never seems to age.<br/>Heather Westfield has always lived a quiet life, but that all changes when she helps a very handsome, very mysterious stranger. There's something not quite right about Jean-Luc, but still, she's never been with a man so charming, so attractive . . . so wonderful. Now if only a murderous villain wasn't after them, they might get their happily-ever-after.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/56/9780061118456.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Undead Next Door (Love at Stake, Book 4)', 'edition': '1st printing/original Cover Art', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.40565056208 Pounds, Width: 0.77 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.77}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.40565056208}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-01-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Vampires', 'Werewolves & Shifters', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban', 'Romantic', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Kerrelyn Sparks'], 'title': 'The Undead Next Door (Love at Stake, Book 4)', 'isbn13': '9780061118456', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061755435', 'ePub': '0061755435'}, 'isbn': '0061118451', 'isbn10': '0061118451', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061755439', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
