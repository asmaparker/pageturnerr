{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Trapped in an old Saxon church, Lady Lily is dragged from her hiding place to the very feet of the warrior who's been hunting for her—Radulf, the King's Sword, a man whose name all speak in fear. Yet when she looks into his coal-black eyes, it is not fear that makes her tremble...but desire. So she lies to save her life—and prays to save her heart.<br/>Even though some instinct whispers that Lily's not who she claims to be, Radulf is helpless against his burning need to possess her. Furious when he discovers her true identity, he nevertheless marries her—not to protect her from the king's wrath, he tells himself, but to keep a close watch on her. For Radulf was betrayed by a woman once before...and now trusting Lily could cost him his life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/95/9780060002695.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Lily and the Sword', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.40124131684 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.40124131684}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2002-03-05', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Erotica', 'Romantic', 'Victorian', 'Westerns', 'Romance', 'Medieval', 'Viking'], 'authors': ['Sara Bennett'], 'title': 'The Lily and the Sword', 'isbn13': '9780060002695', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061760013'}, 'isbn': '0060002697', 'isbn10': '0060002697', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061760013', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
