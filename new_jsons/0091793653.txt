{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House UK', 'synopsis': 'Gideon Blake, artist and animal behaviourist, is used to dealing with distressed and unpredictable animals. But one cold February night he is faced with the challenge of his life. Abducted, handcuffed and blindfolded, Gideon is inexplicably forced by his violent captors to catch a dangerous and highly-strung stallion. Though severely handicapped by the blindfold and fearing certain death, he has no choice but to comply. Bruised and bewildered by the events of that fateful night, Gideon ignores his abductorsâ€™ threats to stay silent and resolves to find out who was behind this sadistic and seemingly irrational act. But a chance encounter leads to a shocking discovery, one that makes Gideon question the motives of those closest to him and brings the devastating realization that danger lies very close to home.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/36/54/9780091793654.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blindfold', 'edition': 'First Edition (Unsta', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.34702442082 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.34702442082}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2003-05-01', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Lyndon Stacey'], 'title': 'Blindfold', 'isbn13': '9780091793654', 'msrp': 29.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0091793653', 'isbn10': '0091793653'}}
