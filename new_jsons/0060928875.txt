Can the United States wipe the slate clean and surmount the racism of its past? Or is color blindness just another name for denial? In this penetrating and provocative book, Ellis Cose probes the depths of the American mind and exposes the contradictions, fears, hopes and illusions embedded in our complicated perceptions of race. Cose trains his practiced eye on the murky waters of race in America and looks at the acute differences, even hostility, in our perceptions of race exposed by the O. J. Simpson trial, not to mention the controversial content of The Bell Curve. Looking beyond the platitudes and pronouncements that tend to distort reality rather than illuminate it, Cose offers a visionary analysis of the steps we must take if we are serious about finding a true resolution to the thorny problem of race in America.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/72/9780060928872.jpg', 'title_long': 'Color-Blind: Seeing Beyond Race in a Race-Obsessed World', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.56}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1998-01-07', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'Sociology', 'Race Relations', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Ellis Cose'], 'title': 'Color-Blind: Seeing Beyond Race in a Race-Obsessed World', 'isbn13': '9780060928872', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0061936111', 'ePub': '0061936111'}, 'isbn': '0060928875', 'isbn10': '0060928875', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061936111', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
