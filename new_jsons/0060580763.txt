While there is no one Latina identity, the editors believe that by offering a glimpse into these writers’ dynamic lives, they will facilitate a better understanding of their unique challenges and their dreams, and most important, their oftentimes shared histories.<br/>The contributors to this collection mirror the compassionate pleas Latinas usually reserve for each other over conversations in dark bars and late night gatherings. “Do they have to think that just because I’m a Latina that I can speak Spanish, curl my hair, paint my toe nails, and dance a rumba--all at the same time?” This, along with other interesting questions, results in a spectacular line up that has Latinas musing on their battling the world, the men that have done them wrong, and of course the mothers who, more often than not, just never understood that their daughters were more Americanas than not.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/66/9780060580766.jpg', 'title_long': 'Border-Line Personalities: A New Generation of Latinas Dish on Sex, Sass, and Cultural Shifting', 'edition': '1rts.
