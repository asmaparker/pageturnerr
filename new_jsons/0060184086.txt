{'book': {'publisher': 'Collins', 'synopsis': 'Do you have a busy life -- and you just can\'t afford to get sick? Do you often feel out of sorts and fatigued? Is it hard to shake sinus problems, sore throats, digestive upsets, aches and pains, or allergies? Are you concerned about the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant infectious illnesses -- and the new threat of devastating diseases such as anthrax, smallpox, and Ebola? Help is in your hands. Infection Protection is your personal guide to the self-treatment of infections, too often misdiagnosed, that can make you sick for weeks, months, and sometimes for life. Infectious illness is poorly understood by doctors, yet more than 75% of Americans suffer from parasitic, bacterial, fungal, or viral infections manifesting as fatigue, depression, sinus problems, digestive disorders, premature aging, baldness, skin problems, periodontal disease, and more. From the common cold to E. coli, from allergies to anthrax, Drs. Ronald Klatz and Robert Goldman explain how to survive the modern plague of infectious diseases through "bug-busting" strategies to detoxify the body, boost the immune system, and significantly improve energy and longevity. You\'ll learn how to protect your body, your home, your food, your environment, and even your pets by implementing anti-infection remedies from the full spectrum of medical practices: from orthodox Western FDAand AMA-approved therapies to cutting-edge nutritional science to traditional integrative medicine -- including Ayurvedic, Asian, herbal, and alternative healing systems. And you\'ll find out how to heal faster if you do get sick. With this indispensable book in hand, you\'ll have the tools to beat these hidden invaders and live the healthy, energetic life you deserve.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/87/9780060184087.jpg', 'title_long': 'Infection Protection: How to Fight the Germs That Make You Sick', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.62 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.62}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2002-04-01', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting'], 'authors': ['Ronald Klatz', 'Medical Development Management Inc.'], 'title': 'Infection Protection: How to Fight the Germs That Make You Sick', 'isbn13': '9780060184087', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060184086', 'isbn10': '0060184086'}}
