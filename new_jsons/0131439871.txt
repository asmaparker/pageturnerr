{'book': {'publisher': 'Wharton School Pub', 'synopsis': 'Global capitalism stands at a crossroads-facing international terrorism, worldwide environmental change, and an accelerating backlash against globalization. Today\'s global companies are at a crossroads, finding new strategies for profitable growth has never been more challenging. Both sets of problems are intimately linked, says Stuart L. Hart-and so are the solutions. In Capitalism at the Crossroads, Hart shows companies how to identify sustainable products that can drive new growth as they also help solve today\'s most crucial social problems. Drawing on his experience consulting with top companies and NGOs worldwide, Hart shows how to integrate new technology to deliver profitable solutions that reduce poverty and protect the environment at the same time. Along the way, you\'ll learn how to become truly indigenous to all your markets-and avoid the pitfalls of traditional "greening" and "sustainability" strategies. This book transcends yesterday\'s stale debates about globalization, pointing the way toward a capitalism that\'s more inclusive, more welcome, and far more successful. But great ideas aren\'t enough. Hart presents on-the-ground techniques for transforming them into reality, helping leaders re-ignite innovation, growth, and profitability in their own businesses, starting today.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/70/9780131439870.jpg', 'title_long': "Capitalism At The Crossroads: The Unlimited Business Opportunities In Solving The World's Most Difficult Problems", 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.1684499886 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1684499886}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 241, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Management & Leadership', 'Systems & Planning', 'Processes & Infrastructure', 'Strategic Planning'], 'authors': ['Stuart L.
