{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'Beautiful Milisant Crispin and handsome, arrogant Wulfric, the future Earl of Shefford, are engaged—and seldom has a betrothed couple been less suited. Her father has decreed that Milisant has a month to accustom herself to the future earl before the marriage takes place. As the time dwindles, Milisant desperately searches for a way out. But Wulfric is falling under a spell himself, cast by the proud, strong woman who will be pledged to him against her will in a few short days. And even as the joining of these two young people draws nearer, so too does a threat of danger which could destroy much more than a planned ceremony.<br/>Johanna Lindsey has created two unforgettable characters tied together by circumstance, but sharing a boundless passion that will force them to search their hearts—and surrender to a yearning far beyond their control.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/41/9780061131141.jpg', 'title_long': 'Joining', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006-08-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'United States', 'Erotica', 'Historical', 'Romantic', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Medieval', 'Viking', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Myths & Legends'], 'authors': ['Johanna Lindsey'], 'title': 'Joining', 'isbn13': '9780061131141', 'msrp': 4.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061131148', 'isbn10': '0061131148'}}
