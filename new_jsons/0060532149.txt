{'book': {'publisher': 'WmMorrowPB', 'synopsis': "Once Emily Miller thought that losing her boyfriend Declan would be the worst thing that could happen. Of course, that was before she learned that the lowlife cad had secretly mortgaged their dream house, run up their shared debts . . . and posted a picture of her on the internet that would make a rugby team blush. Still, she is coping masterfully, despite losing her home and her dignity - until the local newspapers get wind of the story . . .<br/>So here she is - homeless, jobless, loverless . . . and scandalous at thirty-two. Her best friend Cara thinks yoga, aromatherapy, and the perfect potion will turn Emily's karma around. Why not, Emily figures. It might help to attract that handsome stranger she's just barely met. Either that, or she'll hunt down the elusive Mr. Right herself. After all, there isn't much else that could possibly go wrong . . .<br/>And sometimes, when you've got absolutely nothing left to lose . . . that's when you get everything you ever wanted!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/47/9780060532147.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bare Necessity', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.63 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.63}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 372, 'date_published': '2003-04-15', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Single Women', 'Contemporary', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Romance', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Carole Matthews'], 'title': 'Bare Necessity', 'isbn13': '9780060532147', 'msrp': 13.44, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060532149', 'isbn10': '0060532149'}}
