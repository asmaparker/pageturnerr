The main feature of this series is the use of the Concrete-- gt Pictorial-- gt Abstract approach. The students are provided with the necessary learning experiences beginning with the concrete and pictorial stages, followed by the abstract stage to enable them to learn mathematics meaningfully. This approach encourages active thinking, communication of mathematical ideas, and problem solving. This helps develop the foundation students will need for more advanced mathematics. Practice exercises are designed to provide the students with further practice after they have done the relevant workbook exercises. Review exercises are provided for cumulative reviews of concepts and skills. All the practice exercises and review exercises are optional exercises.Format: Paperback Publisher: Singapore MathGrade: 2', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/08/9789810185008.jpg', 'title_long': 'Primary Mathematics 2A Workbook', 'edition': 'U.S. Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.75 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}}, 'pages': 174, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['singapore-math'], 'title': 'Primary Mathematics 2A Workbook', 'isbn13': '9789810185008', 'msrp': 8.7, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '9810185006', 'isbn10': '9810185006'}}
