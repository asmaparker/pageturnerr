{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'The final and largest volume to complete this four-volume treatise is published in response to the intense commercial and research interest in Fourier Transform Interferometry.Presenting current information from leading experts in the field, Volume 4 introduces new information on, for example, applications of Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy in the Far-Infrared Region. The editors place emphasis on surface studies and address advances in Capillary Gas Chromatography - Fourier Transform Interferometry.Volume 4 especially benefits spectroscopists and physicists, as well as researchers in physical, analytical, and surface chemistry.FROM THE PREFACE: Several reasons can be cited for the need to publish Volume 4 in this treatise.First, interest in Fourier transform interferometry (FT-IR) has continued. The number of commercial manufacturers of FT-IR instrumentation has increased, reflecting the increase in demand for such instrumentation. The main thrust in FT-IR instrumentation has focused on applications, and many techniques using FT-IR instrumentation have been generated in order to solve problems heretofore unsolvable. The interest in surfaces relative to catalysts, polymers, and electrical conductors has escalated. Three chapters in Volume 4 are devoted to surfaces. Second, the great acceptance of Volumes 1 through 3 and the demand to continue the treatise have induced us to publish Volume 4.The present volume contains nine chapters, making it the largest of the four volumes. Chapter 1 deals with infrared data processing techniques. Chapter 2 concerns itself with circular dichroism*b1FT-IR. Chapter 3 presents an update on GC*b1FT-IR, a rapidly moving field. Chapter 4 deals with the combination of FT-IR and thermal analysis. Advances in coal analyses using FT-IR are presented in Chapter 5. Reflectance studies are highlighted in Chapters 6, 7, and 8. Chapter 6 deals with structural characterizations made with Langmuir*b1Blodgett monolayers. Also in Chapter 6, the extension of DRIFT into the far-infrared region is shown to be feasible and valuable. Reflection*b1absorption surface studies (FT-IRRAS) are discussed in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 updates us on photoacoustic spectroscopy*b1FT-IR.All of the contributions are made by working experts in these areas. It is the hope that Volume 4 continues in the spirit of the purpose of these volumes, namely, to keep the scientific communities abreast of new developments in FT-IR as applied to chemical systems.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/49/9780122541049.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra: Applications to Chemical Systems', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.4770971554 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4770971554}}, 'pages': 406, 'date_published': '1985-06-11', 'subjects': ['Analytic', 'Industrial & Technical', 'Spectroscopy & Spectrum Analysis', 'Chemical & Biochemical', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Chemistry -> Analytical Chemistry', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Physics -> General', 'Physical & Earth Sciences -> Chemistry -> Industrial & Technical', 'Professional, Career & Trade -> Engineering -> Chemical Engineering'], 'authors': ['John R.
