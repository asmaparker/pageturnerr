Her lawyer hires Nina Halligan for the job.<br/>Halligan, a former prosecutor whose family was massacred by the minions of a drug lord she put in prison, is a private investigator. As she starts digging into this case, she stumbles onto a group of black nationalists called the New Nation, who are reclaiming African art and repatriating it to the Motherland. In addition, a conservative black evangelist, who is setting up church franchises derisively called "McChurches," kidnaps Nina to find out what she knows. She\'s also butting heads with the NYPD, which may have been involved in the death of Malik Martin.
