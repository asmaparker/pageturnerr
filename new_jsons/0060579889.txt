You the mamma\'s boy, I hear."<br/>But Chanelle is wrong. Alvin has more guts than even he realizes. And he isn\'t a mamma\'s boy. In fact, when his over protective mother goes too far, he leaves home.<br/>Where can Alvin go, though?<br/>He heads north. He will follow in the footsteps of his hero -- Matthew Henson, the bold Arctic explorer. Alvin will prove that he can take care of himself. Alvin will go north to the deadly cold; north to terrifying, frozen windy expanses, where it\'s easy to get lost even near shelter; north to polar bears and wolves; north to himself. . . .', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/83/9780060579883.jpg', 'title_long': 'North', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 344, 'date_published': '2004-05-04', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Science, Nature & How It Works', 'Nature', 'Action & Adventure', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World', 'Multicultural Stories'], 'authors': ['Donna Jo Napoli'], 'title': 'North', 'isbn13': '9780060579883', 'msrp': 16.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0060579889', 'isbn10': '0060579889'}}
