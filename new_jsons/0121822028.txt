{'book': {'publisher': 'Elsevier', 'synopsis': 'General Description of the Volume:Nitric Oxide, recently designated "Molecule of the Year," impinges on a wide range of fields in biological research, particularly in the areas of biomedicine and cell and organismal biology, as well as in fundamental chemistry. This volume will be a valuable resource for the experienced researcher as well as for those newly entering the field. This volume continues the coverage of new and important tools for the elucidation of Nitric Oxide action initiated in Volumes 268 and 269 of Methods in Enzymology. Techniques for researching the physiology and toxicity of nitric oxide in cellular and organismal systems are highlighted.General Description of the Series:The critically acclaimed laboratory standard for more than forty years, Methods in Enzymology is one of the most highly respected publications in the field of biochemistry. Since 1955, each volume has been eagerly awaited, frequently consulted, and praised by researchers and reviewers alike. Now with more than 300 volumes (all of them still in print), the series contains much material still relevant today--truly an essential publication for researchers in all fields of life sciences.<br/><br/>Key Features* Biological Activity* NO Donors: Nitrosothiols and Nitroxyls* Peroxynitrite* Oxidant and Antioxidant Action', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/26/9780121822026.jpg', 'title_long': 'Methods In Enzymology, Vol. 301, Part C', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 2.1605301676 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.1605301676}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 589, 'date_published': '1998', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Nutrition', 'Antioxidants & Phytochemicals', 'Vitamins & Supplements', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Anatomy', 'Biochemistry', 'Biology', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine', 'Pharmacology', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Colowick S.P.'], 'title': 'Methods In Enzymology, Vol. 301, Part C', 'isbn13': '9780121822026', 'msrp': 27.12, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0121822028', 'isbn10': '0121822028'}}
