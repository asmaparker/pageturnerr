{'book': {'publisher': 'McGraw-Hill', 'synopsis': 'This book has been tailored for students – in English, education, or library science courses – who may never have studied the subject. This book does not attempt to catalogue children’s literature. Nor does it name every important book. Rather, as an introduction, it presents a balanced selection of books with enough explanation for each example to interest students in literature they may not yet have read. “Introduction to Children’s Literature” comprises two major sections. Part One is a survey of genres: picture books, Mother Goose and concept books, poetry, traditional literature, fantasy, contemporary realism, historical fiction, biography, and informational books. These chapters contain criteria for evaluating books in each genre. Part Two suggests practical strategies for bringing books and children together. Case studies in these chapters help to illustrate how to choose and present books, understand and enhance children’s responses, organize books into units, and organize units into year-long programs of literature. Back-of-the-book features include lists of prizewinning books, a list of children’s book publishers with data on what they publish, and a full subject-title-author index.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/05/9780070233805.jpg', 'title_long': "Introduction to Children's Literature", 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.01 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}}, 'pages': 737, 'date_published': '1979', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Library & Information Science', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Joan I.
