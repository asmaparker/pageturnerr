And with the help of some well-meaning (if slightly loca) t√≠as, she could become L.A.'s most ravishing reborn sex goddess, say adios to the past, and see about capturing the attention of a hot new man. But the new Isa is about to find out that it's not so easy juggling motherhood, career, and sex-symbol status. It could, however, turn out to be a whole lot of fun.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/25/9780060766825.jpg', 'title_long': 'In Between Men (Hot Tamara, 2)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.49 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006-02-21', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Domestic Life', 'Mothers & Children', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Romance', 'Sports', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Mary Castillo'], 'title': 'In Between Men (Hot Tamara, 2)', 'isbn13': '9780060766825', 'msrp': 12.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061745049'}, 'isbn': '0060766824', 'isbn10': '0060766824', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061745041', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
