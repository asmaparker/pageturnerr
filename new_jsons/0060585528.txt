{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Amy Ephron navigates the social contradictions of New York society, a world in which freedom was celebrated even while Prohibition and the strictest social conventions were in force. She brings to life this time and place through the stories of five socialites whose lives are irrevocably changed because of gossip, indiscretion, secrets, and betrayal.<br/>Four women at a bridge party in the elegant Gramercy Park Hotel see a beautiful young woman, whom they all know, leaving a nearby hotel with a man who is not her husband. The sight of twenty-year-old Lizzie Carswell with Billy Holmes is shocking and potentially ruinous, and though they do not know the whole story and despite their mutual promise to keep what they've seen to themselves, it is only a matter of time before one of them talks -- with heartbreaking consequences for them all.<br/>One Sunday Morning is a drama of the strictures of polite society tragically coming to conflict with the liberated spirit of the Jazz Age. With all the romance of Gatsby's New York and the seduction of Josephine Baker's Paris, Ephron's tale is compelling all the way to its surprising and satisfying ending.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/25/9780060585525.jpg', 'title_long': 'One Sunday Morning: A Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.12 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.87}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.12}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2005-04-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'United States'], 'authors': ['Amy Ephron'], 'title': 'One Sunday Morning: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060585525', 'msrp': 21.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060585528', 'isbn10': '0060585528'}}
