{'book': {'publisher': 'Collier Books', 'synopsis': 'Prior to the original publication of Africa in History, the history and development of Africa had been measured by the European concept of "civilization," applying a Eurocentric approach to African art and literature. Basil Davidson\'s landmark work presents the inner growth of Africa and its worldwide significance, the internal dynamic of its old civilizations and their links with Asia, Europe and America, as well as the development of specific areas, tribes and cultures. From accounts of the days of the green Sahara and the great iron age, the earliest Portuguese colonization, the coming of slavery and the subsequent legacy of violence and mistrust, the growth of Islam in the north and the cults of the Congo, the sophistication of art and architecture, and the pattern behind social and tribal mores, the entire picture of the continent emerges. This revised edition reflects the recent astonishing changes in South Africa, including the release of Nelson Mandela.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/19/9780020427919.jpg', 'title_long': 'Africa in History: Themes and Outlines', 'edition': 'Rev&Expndd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 1.5 Inches, Weight: 1.20813319576 Pounds, Width: 5.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.20813319576}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 406, 'date_published': '1992', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Basil Davidson'], 'title': 'Africa in History: Themes and Outlines', 'isbn13': '9780020427919', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0020427913', 'isbn10': '0020427913'}}
