{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Ruth Rothwax, the heroine of Lily Brett\'s Too Many Men, which was hailed as "irresistible" (People) as well as "funny," "powerful," and "chilling" (O magazine), is back. The proprietor of a successful letter-writing business, Ruth has just branched out into a new greeting-card line. But it\'s not easy. Her father, Edek, is driving her crazy at the office. And the very people she thought would be most supportive -- other women -- are not. Instead of acting in one another\'s best interests, the women are catty and competitive, behaviors Ruth swears that she will never imitate. Until she meets the one woman who turns her aspirations of sisterly solidarity -- and her life -- upside down.<br/>Fresh off the plane from Poland, Zofia is a buxom, sixty-something femme fatale with a talent for making balls. Meatballs, that is. When Edek asks his savvy daughter to fund his friend Zofia\'s restaurant, how can Ruth say no? But Ruth knows that gleam in Zofia\'s eye, and it means trouble is on the way for all of them. An unforgettable, heartwarming story of embracing life, You Gotta Have Balls is a funny, moving triumph from the highly inventive Lily Brett.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/91/9780060505691.jpg', 'title_long': 'You Gotta Have Balls: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.25 Pounds, Width: 0.97 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 275, 'date_published': '2006-06-27', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Family Life', 'Psychological', 'Humor & Satire', 'Dark Humor', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lily Brett'], 'title': 'You Gotta Have Balls: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780060505691', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060505699', 'isbn10': '0060505699'}}
