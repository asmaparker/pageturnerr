Meet Fawn Bluefield and Dag Redwing Hickory in Beguilement, the first book in Bujold’s unforgettable four-volume fantasy saga, and witness the birth of their dangerous romance—a love threatened by prejudice and perilous magic, and by Dag’s sworn duty as Lakewalker patroller and necromancer.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/87/9780061137587.jpg', 'title_long': 'Beguilement (The Sharing Knife, Book 1)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.4 Pounds, Width: 1.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2006-10-10', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Historical', 'Romantic', 'Science Fiction', 'Military'], 'authors': ['Lois McMaster Bujold'], 'title': 'Beguilement (The Sharing Knife, Book 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061137587', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061137588', 'isbn10': '0061137588'}}
