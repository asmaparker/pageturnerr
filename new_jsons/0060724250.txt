{'book': {'publisher': 'Mariner Books', 'synopsis': "The New York Times-bestselling Grand Master of suspense deftly displays the other side of his genius, with seven classic western tales of destiny and fatal decision . . . and trust as essential to survival as it is hard-earned.<br/><br/>Trust was rare and precious in the wide-open towns that sprung up like weeds on America's frontier—with hustlers and hucksters arriving in droves by horse, coach, wagon, and rail, and gunmen working both sides of the law, all too eager to end a man's life with a well-placed bullet. In these classic tales that span more than five decades—including the first story he ever published, “The Trail of the Apache”—Elmore Leonard once again demonstrates the superb talent for language and gripping narrative that have made him one of the most acclaimed and influential writers of our time.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/52/9780060724252.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.12 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.12}}, 'pages': 544, 'date_published': '2004-11-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Westerns', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Elmore Leonard'], 'title': 'The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard', 'isbn13': '9780060724252', 'msrp': 27.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060724250', 'isbn10': '0060724250'}}
