{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Four-time #1 bestselling author and veteran television news journalist Bill O'Reilly has more than 5 million copies of his books in print to date! His first book for younger fans, The O'Reilly Factor for Kids, held the honorable distinction of being the #1 bestselling nonfiction title for kids in 2005 according to Nielsen's The Book Standard.<br/>Back again with a dialogue on rights that will have everyone talking, O'Reilly and his coauthor Charles Flowers dole out the kind of blunt, cogent, commonsense commentary you count on them for. Together they explore timely questions being debated in and out of courts today including:<br/>Can a kid wear an antigay T-shirt on campus?<br/>Does a school newspaper have the right to bad-mouth a principal?<br/>Does a mother have the right to eavesdrop on her daughter's telephone conversations?<br/>Some of the answers will surprise you. Some will empower you. All of them will make you think.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/63/9780060846763.jpg', 'title_long': 'Kids Are Americans Too', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2007-10-16', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ["Bill O'Reilly", 'Charles Flowers'], 'title': 'Kids Are Americans Too', 'isbn13': '9780060846763', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'eBook': '0061746169', 'ePub': '0061746169'}, 'isbn': '0060846763', 'isbn10': '0060846763', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061746161', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
