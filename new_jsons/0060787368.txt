{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "The figure of William Wordsworth looms over the nineteenth century like a presiding genius. Sage, seer, and Poet Laureate, Wordsworth was revered by his Victorian contemporaries as a writer of tender, lyrical poetry, a controversial challenger of social and artistic convention, a devoted champion of country life, and the spiritual founder of the conservation movement.<br/>In this masterful work, the first biography to fully examine Wordsworth's entire life, critically acclaimed biographer Juliet Barker draws on unpublished sources to present a new picture of him as both public icon and private family man. Balancing meticulous research with engaging prose, she reveals not only the public figure who was courted and reviled in equal measure but also the complex, elusive, private citizen behind that image, vividly re-creating the intimacy of Wordsworth's domestic circle, showing the love, laughter, loyalty, and tragedies that bound them together. Wordsworth is a major biography of one of the world's foremost poets, and a rich, unforgettable portrait of a fascinating and fiercely passionate man.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/63/9780060787363.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wordsworth: A Life', 'edition': 'Abridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.54 Pounds, Width: 1.09225 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09225}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.54}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 592, 'date_published': '2006-12-12', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Juliet Barker'], 'title': 'Wordsworth: A Life', 'isbn13': '9780060787363', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060787368', 'isbn10': '0060787368'}}
