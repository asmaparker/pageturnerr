{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': "Our super-speed, electronically driven workplace has begun eroding our ability to talk and, what's more, to listen. Yet we must all keep presenting ourselves and our ideas verbally, in person, to make that final sale or get ahead. That means you need new verbal and visual approaches to everything from giving a presentation, handling a client, making an impact at a meeting, or just selling yourself.<br/>Sonya Hamlin is one of the country's leading communication experts. She tackles the new issues in the workplace, rewriting her previous best-selling How to Talk So People Listen to provide a host of new techniques for getting what you want at work today. She covers all your workplace communication needs to discover and return to every time you have to present yourself or your ideas.<br/>This book is written for everyone, from the entry-level employee to the executive. Hamlin delivers groundbreaking insights and solutions to some of today's major communication issues at work: negotiating the generation gaps, integrating a multicultural workforce, organizing your message and making it visual, and understanding what motivates today's audiences. She provides unique, innovative tools in an informal, practical style. This is an invaluable resource for achieving one's goals through skillful, compelling communication techniques.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/60/9780060734060.jpg', 'title_long': "How to Talk So People Listen: Connecting in Today's Workplace", 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-12-27', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Skills', 'Communications', 'Running Meetings & Presentations', 'Human Resources', 'Human Resources & Personnel Management'], 'authors': ['Sonya Hamlin'], 'title': "How to Talk So People Listen: Connecting in Today's Workplace", 'isbn13': '9780060734060', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '006073406X', 'isbn10': '006073406X'}}
