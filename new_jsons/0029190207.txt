{'book': {'publisher': 'Free Press', 'synopsis': "Once Freud's most favoured student and associate, Otto Rank came to be reviled by the psychoanalytic establishment that formerly revered him. This biography exposes the hostile, at time libelious treatment of Rank in the standard histories of psychoanalysis and shows him to be a great analytic pioneer of this century. His influence was felt not only by mental health professionals, but also by such artists and writers as Anais Nin, Henry Miller, Paul Goodman and Max Lerner.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/03/9780029190203.jpg', 'title_long': 'Acts of Will (the Life & Work of Otto Rank)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.75 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 2.13187007354 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.13187007354}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.75}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '1985-02-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Artists, Architects & Photographers', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Social Scientists & Psychologists'], 'authors': ['E.
