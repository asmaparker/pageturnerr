{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall Direct', 'synopsis': 'Ever wonder why despite the record-breaking number of women entering the workforce, there are to date only 3 female CEOs of Fortune 1000 companies? Or why only one half of one percent of today\'s highest paid officers of top public companies are women?<br/>Turn here for lessons from the trenches; see how 12 female executives have successfully climbed the corporate ladder and shattered "the glass ceiling" to ascend into the ranks of upper management.<br/>A compelling "tell-it-like-it-is" mosaic of how today\'s most powerful women cope in no-woman\'s-land, A FEW GOOD WOMEN gives you a first-hand look at what it takes to overcome our most enduring gender-based obstacles. For instance, you\'ll discover interviews exploring: how Shirley Prutch of Martin Marietta had to resign and be invited back to win the respect and the position she deserved; how Nancy Faunce of Eastman Kodak took a chance by going over her boss\' head, instantly commanding the respect of the company\'s upper echelon; how Levi Strauss & Co.\'s Loraine Binion effectively dealt with the double disadvantage of sexism and racism on her way to the top; how Sara Westendorf, laboratory manager at Hewlett-Packard, used a keen sense of humor - along with a healthy dose of the same medicine her male colleagues would routinely administer - to gain entry into the all-guy "clubhouse"; how Linda Wroblewski of Richard A. Eisner & Co. used the open, direct approach to climb into partnership of her regional accounting firm; and how Melissa Cadet turned repeated exposures to the old-boy network into a vice presidency at River West Developments where she is responsible for capital budgeting and forecasting for land developments worth over $100 million.<br/>What\'s more, A FEW GOOD WOMEN shows forward-looking women how to re-think - and retire once and for all - 10 common myths to which corporate America unfortunately subscribes, including: the myth of the ever-present working mom guilt... the myth of high ranking "female-friendly" companies... the myth that time alone will bring male/female parity to the workplace... and more.<br/>You\'ll also see how these women fought back when sexist policies reared their head, including fascinating accounts of how these savvy women have: filed and won discrimination lawsuits... taken fast advantage of new legislation... wisely determined whether or not to continue employment with their offending company... and more.<br/>"Must" reading for any woman wishing to soar to new heights of professional success - and for any man who works with, or for, the opposite sex - this landmark book is an eye-opening, on-the-job survival guide for our time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/07/9780133189407.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Few Good Women: Breaking The Barriers To Top Management', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.5 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 239, 'date_published': '1992-09-21', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Jane White'], 'title': 'A Few Good Women: Breaking The Barriers To Top Management', 'isbn13': '9780133189407', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0133189406', 'isbn10': '0133189406'}}
