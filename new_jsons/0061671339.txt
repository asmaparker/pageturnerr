{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Voyager', 'synopsis': 'The acclaimed artist Brom brilliantly displays his multiple extraordinary talents in The Child Thief—a spellbinding re-imagining of the beloved Peter Pan story that carries readers through the perilous mist separating our world from the realm of Faerie. As Gregory Maguire did with his New York Times bestselling Wicked novels, Brom takes a classic children’s tale and turns it inside-out, painting a Neverland that, like Maguire’s Oz, is darker, richer, more complex than innocent world J.M. Barrie originally conceived. An ingeniously executed literary feat, illustrated with Brom’s sumptuous artwork, The Child Thief is contemporary fantasy at its finest—casting Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, even Captain Hook and his crew in a breathtaking new light.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/33/9780061671333.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Child Thief: A Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 7 Inches, Weight: 2.1384839414 Pounds, Width: 1.49 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.49}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.1384839414}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2009-08-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Mythology & Folk Tales', 'Folklore', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors': ['Brom'], 'title': 'The Child Thief: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780061671333', 'msrp': 26.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061671339', 'isbn10': '0061671339'}}
