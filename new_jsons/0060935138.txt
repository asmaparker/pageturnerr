{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'On the night of Monday, May 4, 1998, in Vatican territory, the bodies of the commander of the Swiss Guard, his wife, and a young lance corporal were found in the barracks of the picturesque force entrusted with protecting the pope. It was the worst bloodbath to take place in more than a century in the heart of the supreme authority of the world\'s one billion Catholics. Four hours later, the Vatican announced that the lance corporal, twenty-three-year-old Cédric Tornay, had shot the couple, then committed suicide in "a fit of madness" brought on by frustration with the unit\'s discipline -- a conclusion it reaffirmed after a nine-month internal inquiry.<br/>But as John Follain\'s hard-hitting exposé shows, the official report was a travesty, a tissue of suppositions, contradictions, and omissions. Based on an exhaustive three-year investigation, City of Secrets reveals how the Vatican, the oldest and most secretive autocracy in the world, staged an elaborate plot to obstruct justice -- and hide the scandals it dared not confess.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/39/9780060935139.jpg', 'title_long': 'City of Secrets: The Startling Truth Behind the Vatican Murders', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.6172943336 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6172943336}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2003-12-23', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Catholicism', 'Popes & the Vatican', 'Churches & Church Leadership', 'Church History', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'History', 'World', 'Religious', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Criminology', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics'], 'authors': ['John Follain'], 'title': 'City of Secrets: The Startling Truth Behind the Vatican Murders', 'isbn13': '9780060935139', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0061736880', 'ePub': '0061736880'}, 'isbn': '0060935138', 'isbn10': '0060935138', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061736889', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
