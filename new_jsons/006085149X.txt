{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperTeen', 'synopsis': '"Don\'t die," Gus whispered.<br/>He reached out and touched her hand. Were there superpowers that could bring her back? Would there be gods in Africa that could help them save her?<br/>"I stayed alive when you ordered me to. Now you return the favor, okay? Just . . . whatever you do, don\'t die."<br/>Ruthlessly stabbed by a fellow avatar, Diana suddenly finds herself hopelessly wandering through the underworlds, fighting her way past everything and anything vile, struggling to find a way back to life.<br/>Up above, her fellow avatars—Gus, Kali, and Tigre—have set sail to Africa, hoping to find refuge and a healer to bring Diana back from death. Time is racing against the avatars, because once Diana reaches the Greek underworld, Hades, she is gone. Forever.<br/>But that problem pales in comparison to the larger issue at hand—only one avatar can take back the power of the gods and live forever.<br/>Beautifully weaving together myth and realism, Tui T. Sutherland delivers the breathtaking conclusion to a trilogy that places the fate of the world in the outcome of a battle between power-hungry pantheons of gods and four teen avatars.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/91/9780060851491.jpg', 'title_long': 'Avatars, Book Three: Kingdom of Twilight', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.04 Pounds, Width: 1.13 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.13}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.04}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2008', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Girls & Women', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Tui T Sutherland'], 'title': 'Avatars, Book Three: Kingdom of Twilight', 'isbn13': '9780060851491', 'msrp': 15.44, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '006085149X', 'isbn10': '006085149X'}}
