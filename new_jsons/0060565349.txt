Now her husband, Daniel Jones, has rallied the men for the "literary equivalent of The Full Monty," in which twenty-seven thoughtful, passionate, and often hilarious men lay it bare when it comes to their wives and girlfriends, their hopes and fears.Enough with pop psychiatrists telling us why men lie, cheat, and want nothing more than to laze around the house in front of the TV. Enough with women wondering aloud -- at increasing volume -- why the men in their lives behave the way they do. The time has come for men to speak for themselves.<br/>Many of the husbands and fathers in these pages contemplate aspects of their personal lives they\'ve never before revealed in print -- they kick open the door on their marriages and sex lives, their fathering and domestic conflicts, their most intimate relationships and situations. Yet unlike the average meat-and-potatoes father who still rules the roost, these men are grappling with new ideas of manhood -- some that they are going after and grabbing, and others that are being thrust upon them by a changing world.<br/>Powerful, heartfelt, and irreverent, The Bastard on the Couch is a bold, unprecedented glimpse into the dark corners and glaring truths of modern relationships that is guaranteed to amuse, entertain, enrich, and provoke.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/43/9780060565343.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Bastard on the Couch: 27 Men Try Really Hard to Explain Their Feelings About Love, Loss, Fatherhood, and Freedom', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.25002102554 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.05}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.25002102554}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2004-04-27', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Fatherhood', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Gender Studies'], 'authors': ['Daniel Jones'], 'title': 'The Bastard on the Couch: 27 Men Try Really Hard to Explain Their Feelings About Love, Loss, Fatherhood, and Freedom', 'isbn13': '9780060565343', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060565349', 'isbn10': '0060565349'}}
