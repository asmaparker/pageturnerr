So you’d think she’d have an ever better life as a very rich widow. But her so-called friends now want nothing to do with her and she’s about to fall back into the world she hated—the world of nobodies. And the icing on top?

That’s the question on everyone’s minds, especially that of Ty Savage, team captain. All he wants is his championship, and there’s no way he’s going to let Faith screw that up.<br/>Between juggling the line-up and fighting off their attraction, one thing’s for certain: this is going to be a season to remember.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/66/9780061579066.jpg', 'title_long': 'True Love and Other Disasters (Chinooks Hockey Team, 4)', 'edition': 'Original', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2009-04-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Sports'], 'authors': ['Rachel Gibson'], 'title': 'True Love and Other Disasters (Chinooks Hockey Team, 4)', 'isbn13': '9780061579066', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061866938'}, 'isbn': '0061579068', 'isbn10': '0061579068', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061866937', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
