In this gripping account, James Shapiro sets out to answer this question, "succeed[ing] where others have fallen short." (Boston Globe)<br/>1599 was an epochal year for Shakespeare and England. During that year, Shakespeare wrote four of his most famous plays: Henry the Fifth, Julius Caesar, As You Like It, and, most remarkably, Hamlet; Elizabethans sent off an army to crush an Irish rebellion, weathered an Armada threat from Spain, gambled on a fledgling East India Company, and waited to see who would succeed their aging and childless queen.<br/>James Shapiro illuminates both Shakespeare’s staggering achievement and what Elizabethans experienced in the course of 1599, bringing together the news and the intrigue of the times with a wonderful evocation of how Shakespeare worked as an actor, businessman, and playwright. The result is an exceptionally immediate and gripping account of an inspiring moment in history.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/43/9780060088743.jpg', 'title_long': 'Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, A', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 0.97 Inches, Weight: 0.74 Pounds, Width: 5.31 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.97}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.74}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 440, 'date_published': '2006-06-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Theatre', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['James Shapiro'], 'title': 'Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, A', 'isbn13': '9780060088743', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0061840904', 'ePub': '0061840904'}, 'isbn': '0060088745', 'isbn10': '0060088745', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061840906', 'binding': 'ebook'}]}}
