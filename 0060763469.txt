Sir Baldwin Furnshill, once a Knight Templar, however, has doubts about the boy’s guilt, and enlists friend and bailiff of Lydford Castle, Simon Puttock, in the hunt for a murderer. But what they seek lies somewhere on the darker side of the village of Wefford, beneath layers of jealousy, suspicion, and hatred -- and the buried truth could prove fatal to anyone who disturbs it.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/66/9780060763466.jpg', 'title_long': "The Merchant's Partner (Knights Templar series)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2004-12-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Cozy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Michael Jecks'], 'title': "The Merchant's Partner (Knights Templar series)", 'isbn13': '9780060763466', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0060763469', 'isbn10': '0060763469', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061869952', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
