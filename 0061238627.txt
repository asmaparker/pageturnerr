But the Star Marines, thirty thousand light years from home, know all too well the horror that still lives.<br/>In the year 2886, in the midst of the intergalactic war that has been raging nonstop for nearly a decade, the unthinkable has occurred. Intelligence has located the gargantuan hidden homeworld of humankind's dedicated foe, the brutal, unstoppable Xul. The time has come for the courageous men and women of the 1st Marine Interstellar Expeditionary Force to strike the killing blow. But misguided politics on an Earth that no longer supports their mission could prove the Marine's greatest enemyâ€”as they plunge bravely into the maelstrom of conflict . . . and into the heart of a million-year-old mystery.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/86/28/9780061238628.jpg', 'title_long': 'Galactic Corps: Book Two of the Inheritance Trilogy (Inheritance Trilogy, 2)', 'edition': '3rd Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.43 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.43}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2008-10-28', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'United States', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Military'], 'authors': ['Ian Douglas'], 'title': 'Galactic Corps: Book Two of the Inheritance Trilogy (Inheritance Trilogy, 2)', 'isbn13': '9780061238628', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061980544'}, 'isbn': '0061238627', 'isbn10': '0061238627', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061980541', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
