{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt, Rinehart and Winston', 'synopsis': "Beautiful reissue of Louise Erdrich's most famous novel, from one of the most celebrated American writers of her generation. Set on and around a North Dakota reservation, 'Love Medicine' tells of the intertwined fates of two families, the Lamartines and the Kashpaws. The women at the heart of this extraordinary community are survivors in a harsh and tumultuous world, united and sustained by the strength and diversity of their love -- the sweet delusion of the flesh; the powerful pull of blood ties; the affection for the old ways vying with the irresistible lure of the new. Their voices mingle and blend to form a continuous braided sequence of narratives which pulse with the sheer energy and drama of life. Greeted with great critical acclaim when first published in 1984, 'Love Medicine' won the US National Book Critics' Circle Award. Louise Erdrich has now substantially revised and expanded the novel for this edition, to complement its companion novels, 'The Beet Queen, Tracks' and 'The Bingo Palace'.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/10/9780030706110.jpg', 'title_long': 'Love Medicine (SIGNED)', 'edition': '1st', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.97 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.97}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '1984', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Louise Erdrich'], 'title': 'Love Medicine (SIGNED)', 'isbn13': '9780030706110', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0030706114', 'isbn10': '0030706114'}}
