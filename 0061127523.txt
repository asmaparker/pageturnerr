{'book': {'publisher': 'Harlequin', 'synopsis': "When wildly independent Meg Piddington finds herself locked in her father's chocolate factory after hours with a most disarmingly attractive gentleman, she doesn't realize that she is his alibiâ€”proof that Gareth Mandeville did not commit a dastardly crime. But admitting as much would destroy her reputation, which gallant Gareth refuses to do. Besides, he believes even prison would be preferable to marriage, which is what their revelation would certainly demand!<br/>At last, here's the perfect opportunity for Meg to don her sleuthing hat to get to the root of the secretive stranger's troubles! Besides, the man sends oh-so-pleasant shivers coursing through her body. And though heaven may well await in Gareth's embrace, danger may dwell there also . . . if the determined lady embarks on a grand mission to win his love.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/26/9780061127526.jpg', 'title_long': 'Guardian of the Night (The Colby Agency: The Specialists)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.2425084882 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.2425084882}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2003-03-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Erotica', 'Romantic', 'Suspense', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Romantic Suspense'], 'authors': ['Debra Webb'], 'title': 'Guardian of the Night (The Colby Agency: The Specialists)', 'isbn13': '9780061127526', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061747912'}, 'isbn': '0061127523', 'isbn10': '0061127523', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061747915', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
