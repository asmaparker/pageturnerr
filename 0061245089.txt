Then she's captured by Bones, a vampire bounty hunter, and is forced into an unholy partnership.<br/>In exchange for finding her father, Cat agrees to train with the sexy night stalker until her battle reflexes are as sharp as his fangs. She's amazed she doesn't end up as his dinner—are there actually good vampires? Pretty soon Bones will have her convinced that being half-dead doesn't have to be all bad. But before she can enjoy her newfound status as kick-ass demon hunter, Cat and Bones are pursued by a group of killers. Now Cat will have to choose a side . . . and Bones is turning out to be as tempting as any man with a heartbeat.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/84/9780061245084.jpg', 'title_long': 'Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)', 'edition': 'Later Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.42 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.42}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2007-10-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Vampires', 'Fantasy', 'Werewolves & Shifters', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jeaniene Frost'], 'title': 'Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)', 'isbn13': '9780061245084', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061744824', 'ePub': '0061744824'}, 'isbn': '0061245089', 'isbn10': '0061245089', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061744822', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
