{'book': {'publisher': 'Prentice Hall', 'synopsis': "Focusing equally on both men and women, this innovative book ties together the empirical research and conceptual discussions surrounding gender in the areas of psychology, sociology, anthropology, medicine, and public health. Going well beyond simple summary statements of the similarities and differences between men and women, it explains the similarities and differences--and the magnitude of differences--between men's and women's thoughts, feelings, and behavior. It reviews the research from multiple perspectives, but emphasizes the implications of social roles, status, and gender-related traits, particularly for relationships and health--areas that are central to readers' lives and that have a great impact on their day-to-day functioning. Sex-Related Differences: Observations and Theory. Achievement. Communication. Friendship. Romantic Relationships. Sex Differences in Health. Relationships and Health. Multiple Roles and Health. Mental Health. Aggression. Chronic Illness. For anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between the sexes, especially in regard to relationships and health.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/94/9780130287694.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Psychology of Gender', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.4803 Inches, Length: 9.17321 Inches, Weight: 2.3038306379 Pounds, Width: 0.98425 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.17321}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.98425}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.3038306379}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.4803}}, 'pages': 674, 'date_published': '2001-05-29', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'General', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Education Theory'], 'authors': ['Vicki S.
