{'book': {'publisher': 'Cooper Square Press', 'synopsis': "Mary Ann Evans, aka George Eliot (1819-1880) achieved lasting renown with the novels Silas Marner, Middlemarch, and Adam Bede. Her masterworks were written after years of living an unconventional life, including a scandalous voyage to Europe with the married writer and editor George Henry Lewes. The scandal intensified when she moved in with Lewes after he separated from his wife. Eliot re-entered London's social life years later, when her literary success made it impossible for respectable society to dismiss her (even Queen Victoria enjoyed her books). She counted among her friends and supporters Dickens, Trollope, and several other Victorian literati.<br/><br/>In this intimate biography, author Hughes provides insight into Eliot's life and work, weighing Eliot's motivations for her controversial actions, and examining the paradoxical Victorian society which she documented to perfection in her novels.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/15/9780815411215.jpg', 'title_long': 'George Eliot: The Last Victorian', 'edition': 'No Additional Printings Listed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.22 Inches, Length: 6.18 Inches, Weight: 1.32938743986 Pounds, Width: 1.06 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.18}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.06}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.32938743986}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.22}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2001-07-02', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods'], 'authors': ['Kathryn Hughes'], 'title': 'George Eliot: The Last Victorian', 'isbn13': '9780815411215', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0815411219', 'isbn10': '0815411219'}}
