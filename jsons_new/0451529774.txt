{'book': {'publisher': 'Signet', 'synopsis': 'One ill-fated evening at the Reform Club, Phileas Fogg rashly bets his companions that he can travel around the entire globe in just eighty days -- and he is determined not to lose. Breaking the well-established routine of his daily life, the reserved Englishman immediately sets off for Dover, accompaned by his hot-blooded manservant Passepartout. Traveling by train, steamship, sailboat, sledge, and even elephant, they must overcome storms, kidnappings, natural disasters, Sioux attacks, and the dogged Inspector Fix of Scotland Yard -- who believes that Fogg has robbed the Bank of England -- to win the extraordinary wager. Around the World in 80 Days gripped audiences on its publication and remains hugely popular, combining exploration, adventure, and a thrilling race against time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/70/9780451529770.jpg', 'title_long': 'Around the World in Eighty Days (Signet Classics)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.26 Pounds, Width: 0.63 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.63}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.26}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2005-06-07', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jules Verne'], 'title': 'Around the World in Eighty Days (Signet Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780451529770', 'msrp': 4.95, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0451529774', 'isbn10': '0451529774'}}
