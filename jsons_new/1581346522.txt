{'book': {'publisher': 'Crossway Books', 'synopsis': '<p>For over twenty-five years John Piper has trumpeted the truth that "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him." He calls it Christian Hedonism. The problem is that many people, after being persuaded, find that this truth is both liberating and devastating.</p>\n<p>It\'s liberating because it endorses our inborn desire for joy. And it\'s devastating because it reveals that we don\'t desire God the way we should. What do you do when you discover the good news that God wants you to be content in him, but then find that you aren\'t?</p>\n<p>If joy in God were merely the icing on the cake of Christian commitment, this book would be insignificant. But Piper argues that joy is so much more. Our being satisfied in God is necessary to show God\'s worthiness and to sustain sacrifices of love.</p>\n<p>Jesus endured the cross for the joy that was set before him. He tasted it. It sustained him through the deepest suffering. His Father was glorified. His people were saved. That is what joy in God does.</p>\n<p>The absolutely urgent question becomes: What can I do if I don\'t have it? With a pastor\'s heart and with radical passion for the glory of Christ, John Piper helps you answer that question.</p>', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/27/9781581346527.jpg', 'title_long': "When I Don't Desire God: How To Fight For Joy", 'dimensions': '5.46 (w) x 8.44 (h) x 0.69 (d)', 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2004', 'subjects': ['God (christianity)', 'Worship And Love', 'Desire For God', 'Happiness', 'Religious Aspects', 'Christianity', 'Praise Of God'], 'authors': ['Piper', 'John'], 'title': "When I Don't Desire God: How To Fight For Joy", 'isbn13': '9781581346527', 'msrp': 10.47, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1581346522', 'isbn10': '1581346522'}}
