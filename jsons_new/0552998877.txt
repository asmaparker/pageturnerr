{'book': {'publisher': 'BLACK SWAN', 'synopsis': "Becky has a fabulous flat in London's trendiest neighborhood, a troupe of glamorous socialite friends, and a closet brimming with the season's must-haves. The only trouble is that she can't actually afford it–not any of it.<br/><br/>Her job writing at Successful Savings not only bores her to tears, it doesn't pay much at all. And lately Becky's been chased by dismal letters from the bank –letters with large red sums she can't bear to read–and they're getting ever harder to ignore.<br/><br/>She tries cutting back. But none of her efforts succeeds. Becky's only consolation is to buy herself something ... just a little something....<br/><br/>Finally a story arises that Becky actually cares about, and her front-page article catalyzes a chain of events that will transform her life–and the lives of those around her–forever.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/71/9780552998871.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 4.99999 Inches, Weight: 0.48722159902 Pounds, Width: 0.74803 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.99999}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.74803}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48722159902}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 319, 'date_published': '2000-09-14', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction'], 'authors': ['Kinsella Sophie'], 'title': 'The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic', 'isbn13': '9780552998871', 'msrp': 14.45, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0552998877', 'isbn10': '0552998877'}}
