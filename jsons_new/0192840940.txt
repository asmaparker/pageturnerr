Part of the fascination stems from the fact that little of what they wrote survives. Here Osborne invites her readers to dip their toes into the fragmentary remains of thinkers from Thales to Pythagoras, Heraclitus to Protagoras, and to try to reconstruct the moves that they were making, to support stories that Western philosophers and historians of philosophy like to tell about their past.<br/><br/>This book covers the invention of western philosophy: introducing to us the first thinkers to explore ideas about the nature of reality, time, and the origin of the universe.<br/><br/>About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/43/9780192840943.jpg', 'title_long': 'Presocratic Philosophy', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.330693393 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.330693393}}, 'pages': 168, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Greek & Roman', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['catherine-osborne'], 'title': 'Presocratic Philosophy', 'isbn13': '9780192840943', 'msrp': 11.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0191578223'}, 'isbn': '0192840940', 'isbn10': '0192840940', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780191578229', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
