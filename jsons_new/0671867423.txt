{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster', 'synopsis': 'The power of words has rarely been given a more compelling demonstration than in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead, he gave the whole nation "a new birth of freedom" in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training, and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece. By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world and to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns, and how Lincoln wove a spell that has not yet been broken.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/23/9780671867423.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words That Remade America', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 317, 'date_published': '1993-06-12', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Military'], 'authors': ['Garry Wills'], 'title': 'Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words That Remade America', 'isbn13': '9780671867423', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0671867423', 'isbn10': '0671867423'}}
