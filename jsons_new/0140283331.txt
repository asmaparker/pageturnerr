{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Books', 'synopsis': 'Lord of the Flies remains as provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, igniting passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger\'s The Catcher in the Rye in its influence on modern thought and literature.<br/><br/>William Golding\'s compelling story about a group of very ordinary small boys marooned on a coral island has become a modern classic. At first it seems as though it is all going to be great fun; but the fun before long becomes furious and life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic and death. As ordinary standards of behaviour collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with them—the world of cricket and homework and adventure stories—and another world is revealed beneath, primitive and terrible.<br/>Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies has established itself as a true classic.<br/><br/>"Lord of the Flies is one of my favorite books. That was a big influence on me as a teenager, I still read it every couple of years."<br/>—Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games<br/><br/>"As exciting, relevant, and thought-provoking now as it was when Golding published it in 1954."<br/>—Stephen King', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/34/9780140283334.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lord of the Flies', 'edition': '3', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.36 Inches, Length: 5.59 Inches, Weight: 0.47 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.59}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.47}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.36}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '1999-10-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['William Golding'], 'title': 'Lord of the Flies', 'isbn13': '9780140283334', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0140283331', 'isbn10': '0140283331'}}
