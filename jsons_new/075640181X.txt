{'book': {'publisher': 'DAW', 'synopsis': 'This standalone portal fantasy transports unsuccessful rockstar Theo Vilmos from modern California to a land of magic and mystery.<br/><br/>Returning to the fantasy genre that made him a coast-to-coast best-selling phenomenon, Tad Williams writes this stand-alone contemporary fantasy novel, set in Northern California—and also in the strange parallel world that coexists in the farthest reaches of the imagination.<br/>Theo Vilmos is a thirty-year-old lead singer in a not terribly successful rock band. Once, he had enormous, almost magical charisma, both onstage and off—but now, life has taken its toll on Theo.<br/><br/>Hitting an all-time low, he seeks refuge in a isolated cabin in the woods. While there, he reads an odd memoir written by a dead relative who believed he had visited the magical world of Faerie. And before Theo can disregard the account as the writings of a madman, he, too, is drawn to a place beyond his wildest dreams...a place that will be, and has always been, his destiny.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/18/9780756401818.jpg', 'title_long': 'The War of the Flowers', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.8438 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8438}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 832, 'date_published': '2004-05-04', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors': ['Tad Williams'], 'title': 'The War of the Flowers', 'isbn13': '9780756401818', 'msrp': 8.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1101657642'}, 'isbn': '075640181X', 'isbn10': '075640181X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101657645', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
