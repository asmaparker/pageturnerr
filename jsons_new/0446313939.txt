{'book': {'publisher': 'Warner Books', 'synopsis': 'First published in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is Hunter S. Thompson\'s savagely comic account of what happened to this country in the 1960s. It is told through the writer\'s account of an assignment he undertook with his attorney to visit Las Vegas and "check it out." The book stands as the final word on the highs and lows of that decade, one of the defining works of our time, and a stylistic and journalistic tour de force. As Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote in The New York Times, it has "a kind of mad, corrosive prose poetry that picks up where Norman Mailer\'s An American Dream left off and explores what Tom Wolfe left out." This Modern Library edition features Ralph Steadman\'s original drawings and three companion pieces selected by Dr. "Jacket Copy for Fear and Loath-ing in Las Vegas," "Strange Rumblings in Aztlan," and "The Kentucky Derby Is Deca-dent and Depraved."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/33/9780446313933.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream', 'edition': 'First Paperback Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.3 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '1982-12', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Political', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Journalists', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Biographical', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture', 'Politics & Government'], 'authors': ['Hunter S.
