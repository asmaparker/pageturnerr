{'book': {'publisher': 'The Museum of Modern Art, New York', 'synopsis': "The big, bold, seductive and surprising color photographs of German photographer Andreas Gursky set forth a stunning image of our contemporary world of high-tech industry, international markets, big-time sports, fast-paced tourism and slick commerce. Tracking the zeitgeist from his native Germany to such far-flung places as Hong Kong, Brasilia, Cairo, New York, Shanghai, Stockholm, Tokyo, Paris, Singapore and Los Angeles, Gursky has earned acclaim at the leading edge of contemporary art with a polished signature style that draws upon a great diversity of ideas, precedents and techniques. Created in collaboration with the artist, this oversize book surveys the fullness of his work to date with gorgeous color plates, generous two-page details, and a wealth of supporting illustrations. The first in-depth study in English of Gursky's art, this book was published in conjunction with a major retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/63/9780870700163.jpg', 'title_long': 'Andreas Gursky', 'dimensions': 'Height: 12.1 Inches, Length: 13.5 Inches, Weight: 5.21 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 13.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 5.21}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 12.1}}, 'pages': 196, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Individual Artists', 'Photography & Video', 'Collections, Catalogues & Exhibitions', 'Individual Photographers'], 'authors': ['Peter Galassi', 'Glenn D.
