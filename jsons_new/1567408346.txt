His last book, Die Trying, inspired the Chicago Tribune to call him "a suspense writer to be reckoned with." In Tripwire, Reacher is settling into lazy Key West when his life is interrupted by a stranger who comes looking for him. When the stranger turns up beaten to death in the Old Town cemetery - fingertips removed - Reacher knows whomever the man was working for is not a friend. Reacher follows the trail to New York, where he confronts the people who dispatched the dead man: an elderly couple still mourning an all-American son lost in Vietnam; an alluring and intelligent woman from Reacher\'s own haunted past; and at the center of the web, an opponent more vicious than any he\'s ever faced. Lee Child confirms his early acclaim with this new tale, as swift and stylish as any suspense novel being written today.<br/><br/>About the Author<br/><br/>LEE CHILD is the author of ten Jack Reacher thrillers, including the New York Times bestsellers Persuader, the Barry Award Winner The Enemy, and One Shot, which has been optioned for a major motion picture by Paramount Pictures.
