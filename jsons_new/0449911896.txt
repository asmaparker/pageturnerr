Mrs. Pike seldom speaks, while Mr. Pike maintains a forced stoicism. Only their ten-year-old, Simon, seems able to acknowledge that their world has changed. He just doesn’t understand why.<br/><br/>The Pikes may choose to stand still, to hide from an unnameable past, but the strange shroud over their home cannot be contained. Soon it’s inching its way toward their neighbors, where brothers Ansel and James will have to confront their own dark secrets if they want to bring their neighborhood back out into the light.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/91/9780449911891.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Tin Can Tree: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.06 Inches, Length: 4.28 Inches, Weight: 0.56 Pounds, Width: 0.17 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.28}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.17}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.56}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.06}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '1996-08-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Tragedy', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Anne Tyler'], 'title': 'The Tin Can Tree: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780449911891', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307788350'}, 'isbn': '0449911896', 'isbn10': '0449911896', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307788351', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
