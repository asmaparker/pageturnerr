The White Man’s Burden is his widely anticipated counterpunch—a brilliant and blistering indictment of the West’s economic policies for the world’s poor. Sometimes angry, sometimes irreverent, but always clear-eyed and rigorous, Easterly argues that we in the West need to face our own history of ineptitude and draw the proper conclusions, especially at a time when the question of our ability to transplant Western institutions has become one of the most pressing issues we face.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/88/25/9780143038825.jpg', 'title_long': "The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.38 Inches, Length: 5.52 Inches, Weight: 0.91 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.52}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.94}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.38}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2007-02-27', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Economic Conditions', 'International', 'Management & Leadership', 'Systems & Planning', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Poverty', 'Sociology', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['William Easterly'], 'title': "The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good", 'isbn13': '9780143038825', 'msrp': 15.98, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0143038826', 'isbn10': '0143038826', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101218129', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
