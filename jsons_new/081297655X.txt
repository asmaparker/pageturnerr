Spanning from the Great Depression to the turbulent Vietnam War era, Wonderland is the epic account of Jesse Vogel, a boy who emerged from a family tragedy with his life spared but his world torn apart. Orphaned after watching his father murder his entire family, Jesse embarks on a personal odyssey that takes him from a Dickensian foster home to college and graduate school to the pinnacle of the medical profession. As an adult, Jesse must summon the strength to reach across the “generation gap” and rescue his endangered teenaged daughter, who has fallen into the drug-infused 1960s counterculture.<br/><br/>Hailed by Library Journal as “the greatest of Oates’s novels,” Wonderland is the capstone of a magnificent literary excursion that plunges beneath the glossy surface of American life.<br/><br/>Wonderland is the final novel in Joyce Carol Oates’s Wonderland Quartet. The books that complete this acclaimed series, A Garden of Earthly Delights, Expensive People, and them, are also available from the Modern Library.<br/><br/>J', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/57/9780812976557.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wonderland (The Wonderland Quartet)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.95019234922 Pounds, Width: 1.06 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.06}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95019234922}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.95}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '2006-09-12', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Joyce Carol Oates'], 'title': 'Wonderland (The Wonderland Quartet)', 'isbn13': '9780812976557', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '081297655X', 'isbn10': '081297655X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307549617', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
