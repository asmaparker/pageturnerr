{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow & Company, Inc.', 'synopsis': 'In this compelling book, Elan Golomb identifies the crux of the emotional and psychological problems of millions of adults. Simply put, the children of narcissist -- offspring of parents whose interest always towered above the most basic needs of their sons and daughters -- share a common belief: They believe they do not have the right to exist.<br/>The difficulties experienced by adult children of narcissists can manifest themselves in many ways: for examples, physical self-loathing that takes form of overeating, anorexia, or bulimia; a self-destructive streak that causes poor job performance and rocky personal relationships; or a struggle with the self that is perpetuated in the adult\'s interaction with his or her own children. These dilemmas are both common and correctable, Dr. Golomb tells us.<br/>With an empathic blend of scholarship and case studies, along with her own personal narrative of her fight for self, Dr. Golomb plumbs the depths of this problem, revealing its mysterious hold on the affairs of otherwise bright, aware, motivated, and worthy people. Trapped in the Mirror explores. the nature of the paralysis and lack of motivation so many adults feel stress and its role in exacerbating childhood wrongs why do many of our relationships seem to be "reruns" of the past how one\'s body image can be formed by faulty parenting how anger must be acknowledge to be overcome and, most important, how even the most traumatized self can be healed.<br/>Rooted in a profoundly humanist traditional approach, and suffused with the benefit of the latest knowledge about intrafamily relationships, Trapped in the Mirror offers more than the average self-help book; it is truly the first self-heal book for millions.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/17/9780688140717.jpg', 'title_long': 'Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '1995-03-28', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Conflict Management', 'Emotions', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Mental Illness', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Conflict Resolution', 'Parent & Adult Child', 'Parenting'], 'authors': ['Elan Golomb'], 'title': 'Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self', 'isbn13': '9780688140717', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0062227025'}, 'isbn': '0688140718', 'isbn10': '0688140718', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062227027', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
