{'book': {'publisher': 'Polity', 'synopsis': "Politicians invoke grand ideas: social justice, democracy, liberty, equality,community. But what do these ideas really mean? How can politicians across the political spectrum appeal to the same values?<br/><br/>This revised and expanded edition of Political Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide for Students and Politicians, answers these important questions. Accessible and lively, the book is an ideal student text, but it also brings the insights of the world's leading political philosophers to a wide general audience. Using plenty of examples, it equips readers to think for themselves about the ideas that shape political life.<br/><br/>Democracy works best when both politicians and voters move beyond rhetoric to think clearly and carefully about the political principles that should govern their society. But clear thinking is difficult in an age when established orthodoxies have fallen by the wayside. Bringing political philosophy out of the ivory tower and within the reach of all, this book provides us with tools to cut through the complexities of modern politics. In so doing, it makes a valuable contribution to the democratic process.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/23/9780745635323.jpg', 'title_long': "Political Philosophy: A Beginners' Guide for Students and Politicians", 'edition': '2', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.499983 Inches, Length: 5.480304 Inches, Weight: 0.73193470984 Pounds, Width: 0.818896 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.480304}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.818896}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.73193470984}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.499983}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2006-08-04', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Political', 'Politics & Government', 'Political Science', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Adam Swift'], 'title': "Political Philosophy: A Beginners' Guide for Students and Politicians", 'isbn13': '9780745635323', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0745635326', 'isbn10': '0745635326'}}
