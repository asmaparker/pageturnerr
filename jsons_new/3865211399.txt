{'book': {'publisher': 'Steidl', 'synopsis': "A beloved photobook classic from the pioneer of color photography<br/>This is a reprint of the immensely successful Early Color (2008), which presented Saul Leiter's remarkable body of color work to the public for the first time in book form. Although Edward Steichen had exhibited some of Leiter's color photography at The Museum of Modern Art in 1953, it remained virtually unknown to the world thereafter. Leiter moved to New York in 1946 to become a painter, but through his friendship with Richard Pousette-Dart he quickly recognized the creative potential of photography. Leiter continued to paint, exhibiting with Philip Guston and Willem de Kooning, but the camera remained his ever-present means of recording life in the metropolis. None of Leiter's contemporaries, with the partial exception of Helen Levitt, assembled a comparable body of work: subtle, often abstract compositions of lyrical, eloquent color.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/92/9783865211392.jpg', 'title_long': 'Saul Leiter: Early Color', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.26 Inches, Length: 8.22 Inches, Weight: 1.6314207388 Pounds, Width: 0.91 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.22}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.91}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.6314207388}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.26}}, 'pages': 158, 'date_published': '2006-01-15', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Individual Artists', 'Photography & Video', 'Collections, Catalogues & Exhibitions', 'Equipment, Techniques & Reference', 'Travel', 'Individual Photographers', 'Photojournalism & Essays'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Saul Leiter: Early Color', 'isbn13': '9783865211392', 'msrp': 42.21, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '3865211399', 'isbn10': '3865211399'}}
