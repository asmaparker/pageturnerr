{'book': {'publisher': 'Encounter Books', 'synopsis': 'This book presents the kind of eye-opening insights into the history and culture of race for which Sowell has become famous. As late as the 1940s and 1950s, he argues, poor Southern rednecks were regarded by Northern employers and law enforcement officials as lazy, lawless, and sexually immoral. This pattern was repeated by blacks with whom they shared a subculture in the South. Over the last half century poor whites and most blacks have moved up in class and affluence, but the ghetto remains filled with black rednecks. Their attempt to escape, Sowell shows, is hampered by their white liberal friends who turn dysfunctional black redneck culture into a sacrosanct symbol of racial identity. In addition to Black Rednecks and White Liberals, the book takes on subjects ranging from Are Jews Generic? to The Real History of Slavery.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/64/9781594030864.jpg', 'title_long': 'Black Rednecks and White Liberals', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.58953290902 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.58953290902}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 250, 'date_published': '2005-06-01', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Sociology', 'Race Relations', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Thomas Sowell'], 'title': 'Black Rednecks and White Liberals', 'isbn13': '9781594030864', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1594030863', 'isbn10': '1594030863'}}
