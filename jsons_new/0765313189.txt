{'book': {'publisher': 'Tor Books', 'synopsis': 'Rock band Wanderlust is about to hit it big, guitarist Dave Kendall is sure of that. They\'re playing better venues, in front of bigger crowds-and the people showing up at the after parties are increasingly good-looking and cool. Some even radiate power, like "Master" Jeffries, the tall, saturnine man who seems to have some sort of weird control over Dave\'s fellow bandmates.<br/><br/>But Dave\'s too tired to pay much attention to Jeffries. He\'s tired a lot, lately, and making music isn\'t as much fun as it used to be. Probably he\'s just working-and partying-too hard.<br/><br/>Luckily, Dave has a friend who takes what\'s happening to him very seriously. Diana Tregarde is a practicing witch and a Guardian of the Earth. It\'s her job to keep an eye on innocents like Dave and make sure they stay out of trouble and don\'t become someone\'s lunch.<br/><br/>Jeffries has been on Diana\'s hit list since she first spotted him pursuing a young Romany.
