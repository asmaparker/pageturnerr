{'book': {'publisher': 'Grove Press', 'synopsis': 'When Edie was first published, it quickly became an international bestseller and then took its place among the classic books about the 1960s. Edie Sedgwick exploded into the public eye like a comet. She seemed to have it all: she was aristocratic and glamorous, vivacious and young, Andy Warhol’s superstar. But within a few years she flared out as quickly as she had appeared, and before she turned twenty-nine she was dead from a drug overdose.<br/><br/>In a dazzling tapestry of voices\x97family, friends, lovers, rivals\x97the entire meteoric trajectory of Edie Sedgwick’s life is brilliantly captured. And so is the Pop Art world of the \x9160s: the sex, drugs, fashion, music\x97the mad rush for pleasure and fame. All glitter and flash on the outside, it was hollow and desperate within\x97like Edie herself, and like her mentor, Andy Warhol. Alternately mesmerizing, tragic, and horrifying, this book shattered many myths about the \x9160s experience in America.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/41/03/9780802134103.jpg', 'title_long': 'Edie: American Girl', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 6.23 Inches, Weight: 1.44182319348 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.23}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.44182319348}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.2}}, 'pages': 564, 'date_published': '1994-10-14', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'History', 'Americas', 'World', 'Women in History'], 'authors': ['Jean Stein'], 'title': 'Edie: American Girl', 'isbn13': '9780802134103', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0802190634'}, 'isbn': '0802134106', 'isbn10': '0802134106', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780802190635', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
