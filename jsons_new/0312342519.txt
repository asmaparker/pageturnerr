In the week before Jack plans to marry, the pair heads out from Los Angeles to the Santa Ynez wine country. For Jack, the tasting tour is Seven Days to D-Day, his final stretch of freedom. For Miles--who has divorced his wife, is facing an uncertain career and has lost his passion for living-the trip is a week long opportunity to evaluate his past, his future and himself.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/17/9780312342517.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sideways: A Novel', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.1999836 Inches, Length: 5.55 Inches, Weight: 0.76941329438 Pounds, Width: 0.95 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.55}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.95}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.76941329438}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.1999836}}, 'pages': 354, 'date_published': '2004-10-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Rex Pickett'], 'title': 'Sideways: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780312342517', 'msrp': 9.9, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0312342519', 'isbn10': '0312342519', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781429907873', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
