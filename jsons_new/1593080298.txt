His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “&&LI&&RThe Metamorphosis&&L/I&&R,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. &&LP&&RBringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “&&LI&&RThe Judgment&&L/I&&R,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “&&LI&&RThe Stoker&&L/I&&R,” which became the first chapter of his novel &&LI&&RAmerika&&L/I&&R, are here included. These two, along with “&&LI&&RThe Metamorphosis&&L/I&&R,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family. &&L/P&&R&&LP&&RAlso included are “&&LI&&RIn the Penal Colony&&L/I&&R,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “&&LI&&RA Hunger Artist&&L/I&&R,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka’s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life. &&L/P&&R&&LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&&R&&LSTRONG&&RJason Baker&&L/B&&R&&L/B&&R is a writer of short stories living in Brooklyn, New York.&&L/P&&R&&L/DIV&&R', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/97/9781593080297.jpg', 'title_long': 'Metamorphosis and Other Stories (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)', 'edition': 'Trade Paperback Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.1875 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.56 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1875}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.56}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2003-07-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Franz Kafka'], 'title': 'Metamorphosis and Other Stories (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)', 'isbn13': '9781593080297', 'msrp': 9.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1593080298', 'isbn10': '1593080298', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781411432680', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
