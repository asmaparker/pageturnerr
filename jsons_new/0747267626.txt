{'book': {'publisher': 'Gardners Books', 'synopsis': "The stakes get higher, the chases get faster, and the men get hotter<br/><br/>Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has a big problem. Seven-year-old Annie Soder and her mother Evelyn have disappeared - and estranged husband Steven, shady owner of a seed bar, is not at all happy. Finding a missing child is an unusual assignment, but as a favour to her parents' neighbour, Evelyn's grandmother, Stephanie agrees to follow the trail - and finds a lot more than she bargained for.<br/><br/>The case is somehow linked to the very scary Eddie Abruzzi. Both cop Joe Morelli, Stephanie's on-again, off-again fianc√©, and Ranger, her mentor and tormentor, have warned her about Abruzzi - but it's Abruzzi's soulless eyes and mannerisms that frighten her most. Stephanie needs Ranger's expertise, and she's willing to accept his help to find Annie even though it might mean getting too involved with him. Also with her are Lula (who's not going to miss the action) and Albert, Evelyn's almost-qualified lawyer (and laundromat manager). The search turns out to be a race between Stephanie's posse, the True Blue Bonds' agent - a Rangerette known as Jeanne Ellen Burrowes - and the Abruzzi crew. Not to mention the killer rabbit on the loose!<br/><br/>Get ready for the ride of your life with Stephanie's funniest, most riotous misadventure yet. THe world of Plum has never been wilder.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/21/9780747267621.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hard Eight', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.92912 Inches, Length: 4.40944 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.86614 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.40944}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86614}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.92912}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery'], 'authors': ['Janet Evanovich'], 'title': 'Hard Eight', 'isbn13': '9780747267621', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0747267626', 'isbn10': '0747267626'}}
