{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster', 'synopsis': "Plan of Attack is the definitive account of how and why President George W. Bush, his war council, and allies launched a preemptive attack to topple Saddam Hussein and occupy Iraq. Bob Woodward's latest landmark account of Washington decision making provides an original, authoritative narrative of behind-the-scenes maneuvering over two years, examining the causes and consequences of the most controversial war since Vietnam.<br/>Based on interviews with 75 key participants and more than three and a half hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush, Plan of Attack is part presidential history charting the decisions made during 16 critical months; part military history revealing precise details and the evolution of the Top Secret war planning under the restricted codeword Polo Step; and part a harrowing spy story as the CIA dispatches a covert paramilitary team into northern Iraq six months before the start of the war. This team recruited 87 Iraqi spies designated with the cryptonym DB/ROCKSTARS, one of whom turned over the personnel files of all 6,000 men in Saddam Hussein's personal security organization.<br/>What emerges are astonishingly intimate portraits: President Bush in war cabinet meetings in the White House Situation Room and the Oval Office, and in private conversation; Dick Cheney, the focused and driven vice president; Colin Powell, the conflicted and cautious secretary of state; Donald Rumsfeld, the controlling war technocrat; George Tenet, the activist CIA director; Tommy Franks, the profane and demanding general; Condoleezza Rice, the ever-present referee and national security adviser; Karl Rove, the hands-on political strategist; other key members of the White House staff and congressional leadership; and foreign leaders ranging from British Prime Minister Blair to Russian President Putin.<br/>Plan of Attack provides new details on the intelligence assessments of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction and the planning for the war's aftermath.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/86/9780743255486.jpg', 'title_long': 'Plan of Attack: The Definitive Account of the Decision to Invade Iraq', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4375 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 1.24 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.24}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4375}}, 'pages': 496, 'date_published': '2004-10-11', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Military', 'Iraq War', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Political Science', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Bob Woodward'], 'title': 'Plan of Attack: The Definitive Account of the Decision to Invade Iraq', 'isbn13': '9780743255486', 'msrp': 18, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0743262875', 'ePub': '0743262875'}, 'isbn': '0743255488', 'isbn10': '0743255488', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780743262873', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
