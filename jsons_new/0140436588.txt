{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': '"Fight on, brave knights! Man dies, but glory lives!"<br/><br/>Banished from England for seeking to marry against his father\'s wishes, Ivanhoe joins Richard the Lion Heart on a crusade in the Holy Land. On his return, his passionate desire is to be reunited with the beautiful but forbidden lady Rowena, but he soon finds himself playing a more dangerous game as he is drawn into a bitter power struggle between the noble King Richard and his evil and scheming brother John. The first of Scott\'s novels to address a purely English subject, Ivanhoe is set in a highly romanticized medieval world of tournaments and sieges, chivalry and adventure where dispossessed Saxons are pitted against their Norman overlords, and where the historical and fictional seamlessly merge.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
