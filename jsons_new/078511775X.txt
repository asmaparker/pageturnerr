{'book': {'publisher': 'Marvel Comics', 'synopsis': "It seemed like a simple enough idea at the time. Now that their arch-enemy, Doctor Doom, had seemingly perished, the Fantastic Four would journey into his nation of Latveria, disassemble its war machine and set its oppressed citizens free. But what appeared to be a black-and-white situation quickly turns a murky shade of grey, and Reed Richards and his family find themselves besieged on all sides - both by those they thought of as their allies, and by the very people they are trying to save. And in the awful aftermath of their authoritative action, three of the Four must contend with the defenses of the afterlife - and storm the gates of Heaven itself to rescue a fallen teammate. They've faced Galactus, the destroyer of everything; now, they face the creator of everything, as the FF are reunited in the hereafter.
