{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': 'When Jimmy Skunk curls up to take a nap in an old barrel, the imp of mischief gets the better of Peter Rabbit. Tons of trouble plague the long-eared prankster after he decides it\'d be great fun to see the barrel — with Jimmy inside — roll down from its resting point high on a hill.<br/>Reddy Fox gets the blame for Jimmy\'s wild ride (as well as a dose of the skunk\'s "perfume"); Peter gets his comeuppance for playing nasty tricks; and before the day is out, Jimmy Skunk and Unc\' Billy Possum go egg-hunting and wind up in a pretty pickle in Farmer Brown\'s henhouse.<br/>Children will delight in these warm, whimsical adventures that combine all the interest and excitement of a good story with gentle lessons about nature, wildlife and such virtues as courtesy, kindness, and preparedness.<br/>Newly reset in large, easy-to-read type, the text is enhanced by six black-and-white illustrations by Thea Kliros, based on Harrison Cady\'s originals.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/33/9780486280233.jpg', 'title_long': "The Adventures of Jimmy Skunk (Dover Children's Thrift Classics)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.24 Inches, Length: 5.18 Inches, Weight: 0.18 Pounds, Width: 0.29 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.18}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.29}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.18}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.24}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '1994-05-20', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Action & Adventure', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['Thornton W.
