{'book': {'publisher': 'Kodansha USA Inc', 'synopsis': 'Tanizaki has long been regarded as one of the giants of twentieth-century Japanese writing. In the postwar period, most of his works have become known worldwide, and his place in modern literature is as assured as it is eminent.<br/>What distinguishes this wonderful new collection--a novella (the title story) and two shorter pieces--is its lightheartedness, its comic realism. All three stories, however, are variations on a favorite theme: dominance and submission in private relationships. The "man" in the title piece is a typical Tanizaki hero--spoiled, self-indulgent, and obstinately ineffectual--caught up in a war between his vindictive former wife and her willful young successor, both rivals of the fourth party in the title: Lily--seductive, elegant, and magnificently in control--a tortoiseshell cat. The struggle among these three female characters for possession of this feckless man, and his bumbling attempts to assert himself, make for a series of richly entertaining confrontations.<br/>This is followed by "The Little Kingdom," which describes the curiously shifting relationship between a hard-pressed schoolteacher and a small but indomitable pupil determined to establish his own rule. And the collection ends with "Professor Rado," a sly portrait of a self-important academic, seen from the point of view of a journalist eager to "get a story." In a series of interviews, the professor responds to questions merely with grunts; but by accident the journalist ultimately discovers a scandalous hidden side to this eminently respectable gentleman--one so comically grotesque that it could only have come from Tanizaki\'s well-known store of erotic curiosities.<br/>Here is Tanizaki at his best, displaying--in a first international edition--the skills that made Mishima call his writing "above all, delicious, like French or Chinese cuisine."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/58/9784770016058.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Cat, a Man, and Two Women', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.5 inches, Weight: 0.35053499658 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35053499658}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}}, 'pages': 164, 'date_published': '1991', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Myths & Legends'], 'authors': ['Junichiro Tanizaki'], 'title': 'A Cat, a Man, and Two Women', 'isbn13': '9784770016058', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '4770016050', 'isbn10': '4770016050'}}
