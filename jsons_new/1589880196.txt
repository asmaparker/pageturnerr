Open Secrets / Inward Prospects divides in a rough but ready way into two sorts: observations about our external world well known to all but not always openly told, and sightings of internal vistas and omens, wherein she looks at herself as a sample soul.<br/>Often the aphorisms balance opposing thoughts, as if the writer were\x97simultaneously\x97on both ends of the seesaw.<br/>In the preface Eva Brann describes her manner of composition: "I wrote these thoughts down on about two thousand sheets, two to three thoughts per paper, and I kept them in some used manila envelopes, the earliest of which bore a postmark of 1972."<br/>Eva Brann is a member of the senior faculty at St. John\'s College in Annapolis, Maryland, where she has taught for over fifty years. She is a recipient of the National Humanities Medal.
