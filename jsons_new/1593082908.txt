What begins as a passionate love story takes a surprising turn into the hidden world of the early Zionist movement in Victorian England.&&LBR&&R&&LBR&&RThe story opens memorably at a roulette table, where we first meet the young and idealistic Daniel Deronda and the enchanting Gwendolen Harleth―whom many critics consider to be George Eliot’s finest creation. Although the two are immediately drawn to one another, Gwendolen―outwardly alluring and vivacious, inwardly complex and unsettled―is forced by circumstance into an oppressive marriage with the harsh aristocratic Henleigh Grandcourt.&&LBR&&R&&LBR&&RDeeply unhappy, she turns for friendship to Daniel, only to discover his involvement with Mirah Lapidoth, a talented young Jewish woman. Torn between his devotion to Gwendolen and his passion for Mirah and the plight of her people, Daniel is forced to look at his own mysterious past and find out who he really is―and who he wants to become.&&LBR&&R&&LBR&&R&&L/P&&R&&LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&&R&&LSTRONG&&REarl L.
