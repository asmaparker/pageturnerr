{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'This classic guide, from the renowned novelist and professor, has helped transform generations of aspiring writers into masterful writers—and will continue to do so for many years to come.<br/><br/>John Gardner was almost as famous as a teacher of creative writing as he was for his own works. In this practical, instructive handbook, based on the courses and seminars that he gave, he explains, simply and cogently, the principles and techniques of good writing. Gardner’s lessons, exemplified with detailed excerpts from classic works of literature, sweep across a complete range of topics—from the nature of aesthetics to the shape of a refined sentence. Written with passion, precision, and a deep respect for the art of writing, Gardner’s book serves by turns as a critic, mentor, and friend. Anyone who has ever thought of taking the step from reader to writer should begin here.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/31/9780679734031.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.29921259812 Inches, Length: 8.5039369992 inches, Weight: 0.4850169764 Pounds, Width: 5.4330708606 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5039369992}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.4330708606}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4850169764}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.29921259812}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '1991-06-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'History & Criticism', 'Books & Reading', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Reference', 'Foreign Language Study & Reference', 'Words, Language & Grammar', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing'], 'authors': ['John Gardner'], 'title': 'The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers', 'isbn13': '9780679734031', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307756718'}, 'isbn': '0679734031', 'isbn10': '0679734031', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307756718', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
