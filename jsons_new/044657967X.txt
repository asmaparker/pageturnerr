{'book': {'publisher': 'Grand Central Publishing', 'synopsis': "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Nelson DeMille comes a suspenseful new novel featuring Detective John Corey and an all-too-plausible conspiracy to detonate a nuclear bomb in two major American cities. Welcome to the Custer Hill Club--an informal men's club set in a luxurious Adirondack hunting lodge whose members include some of America's most powerful business leaders, military men, and government officials. Ostensibly, the club is a place to gather with old friends, hunt, eat, drink, and talk off-the-record about war, life, death, sex and politics. But one Fall weekend, the Executive Board of the Custer Hill Club gathers to talk about the tragedy of 9/11 and what America must do to retaliate. Their plan is finalized and set into motion. That same weekend, a member of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force is reported missing. His body is soon discovered in the woods near the Custer Hill Club's game reserve. The death appears to be a hunting accident, and that's how the local police first report it, but Detective John Corey has his doubts. As he digs deeper, he begins to unravel a plot involving the Custer Hill Club, a top-secret plan known only by its code name: Wild Fire. Racing against the clock, Detective Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, find they are the only people in a position to stop the button from being pushed and chaos from being unleashed.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/74/9780446579674.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wild Fire', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.375 Inches, Weight: 1.65 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.375}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 528, 'date_published': '2006-11-06', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Nelson DeMille'], 'title': 'Wild Fire', 'isbn13': '9780446579674', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '044657967X', 'isbn10': '044657967X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780759569447', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
