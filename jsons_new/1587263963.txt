{'book': {'publisher': 'Ann Arbor Media', 'synopsis': "HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics. 'I always deserve the best treatment because I never put up with any other.' Beautiful, rich, self-assured and witty, Emma Woodhouse delights in match-making those around her, with no apparent care for her own romantic life. Taking young Harriet Smith under her wing, Emma sets her sights on finding a suitable match for her friend. Chided for her mistakes by old friend Mr Knightley, it is only when Harriet starts to pursue her own love interests that Emma realizes the true hidden depths of her own heart. Delightful, engaging and entertaining, Emma is arguably Austen's most well-loved social comedy.", 'language': 'de', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/39/65/9781587263965.jpg', 'title_long': 'Emma', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1.35 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}}, 'pages': 424, 'date_published': '2006-07-14', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['Jane Austen'], 'title': 'Emma', 'isbn13': '9781587263965', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1587263963', 'isbn10': '1587263963'}}
