{'book': {'publisher': 'Taschen', 'synopsis': "A fascinating survey of cover art (TASCHEN's 25th anniversary special edition) Record covers are a sign of our life and times. Like the music on the discs, they address such issues as love, life, death, fashion, and rebellion. For music fans the covers are the expression of a period, of a particular time in their lives. Many are works of art and have become as famous as the music they stand for?Andy Warhol's covers, for example, including the banana he designed for The Velvet Underground. This special edition of Record Covers presents a selection of the best 60s to 90s rock album covers from music archivist, disc jockey, journalist, and ex-record publicity executive Michael Ochs's enormous private collection. Both a trip down memory lane and a study in the evolution of cover art, this is a sweeping look at an under-appreciated art form.", 'language': 'de', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/56/9783822840856.jpg', 'title_long': '1000 Record Covers', 'edition': 'Anniversary', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.93 Inches, Length: 5.38 Inches, Weight: 2.56397610706 Pounds, Width: 1.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.38}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.56397610706}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.93}}, 'pages': 576, 'date_published': '2005-05-15', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Drawing', 'History & Criticism', 'Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Antiques & Collectibles', 'Records'], 'authors': ['Michael Ochs'], 'title': '1000 Record Covers', 'isbn13': '9783822840856', 'msrp': 14.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '3822840858', 'isbn10': '3822840858'}}
