{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House', 'synopsis': 'NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The classic chronicle of a “terribly misguided and terribly funny” (The Washington Post) hike of the Appalachian Trail, from the author of A Short History of Nearly Everything and The Body<br/><br/>“The best way of escaping into nature.”—The New York Times<br/><br/>Back in America after twenty years in Britain, Bill Bryson decided to reacquaint himself with his native country by walking the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail, which stretches from Georgia to Maine. The AT offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes—and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings.<br/><br/>For a start there’s the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa along for the walk. But A Walk in the Woods is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson’s acute eye is a wise witness to this beautiful but fragile trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America’s last great wilderness. An adventure, a comedy, and a celebration, A Walk in the Woods is a modern classic of travel literature.<br/><br/>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/26/9780767902526.jpg', 'title_long': 'Random House A Walk in The Woods', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.92 Inches, Length: 5.26 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.76 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.26}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.76}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.92}}, 'pages': 276, 'date_published': '1999', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Hiking & Camping', 'Excursion Guides', 'Categories'], 'authors': ['Bill Bryson'], 'title': 'Random House A Walk in The Woods', 'isbn13': '9780767902526', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Misc.', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307717836', 'ePub': '0307717836'}, 'isbn': '0767902521', 'isbn10': '0767902521', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307717832', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
