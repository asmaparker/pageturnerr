{'book': {'publisher': 'Hachette Jeunesse', 'synopsis': 'Hailed as “a classic. . . . humorous, full of warmth and real invention” (The New Yorker), this beloved story -first published more than fifty years ago- introduces readers to Milo and his adventures in the Lands Beyond.<br/><br/>For Milo, everything’s a bore. When a tollbooth mysteriously appears in his room, he drives through only because he’s got nothing better to do. But on the other side, things seem different. Milo visits the Island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), learns about time from a ticking watchdog named Tock, and even embarks on a quest to rescue Rhyme and Reason! Somewhere along the way, Milo realizes something astonishing. Life is far from dull. In fact, it’s exciting beyond his wildest dreams. . . .', 'language': 'fr', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/74/9782013218474.jpg', 'title_long': 'Le Royaume fantôme', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.0078740086 Inches, Length: 4.9606299162 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.5118110231 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.9606299162}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5118110231}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.440924524}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.0078740086}}, 'pages': 251, 'date_published': '2003-01-15', 'subjects': ['Subjects'], 'authors': ['Norton Juster'], 'title': 'Le Royaume fantôme', 'isbn13': '9782013218474', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '2013218478', 'isbn10': '2013218478'}}
