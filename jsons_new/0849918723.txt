{'book': {'publisher': 'Thomas Nelson Publishers', 'synopsis': '"The more I read the Bible, the more evident it becomes that everything I have ever taught or written about effective leadership over the past 25 years, Jesus did to perfection. He is simply the greatest leadership role model of all time." Ken Blanchard<br/>With simple yet profound principles from the life of Jesus, and dozens of stories and leadership examples from his life experiences, veteran author, speaker and leadership expert Ken Blanchard guides readers through the process of discovering how to lead like Jesus. He describes it as the process of aligning two internal domains-the heart and the head-and two external domains, the hands and the habits. These four dimensions of leadership form the outline for this very practical and transformational book.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/87/28/9780849918728.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lead Like Jesus: Lessons from the Greatest Leadership Role Model of All Time', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.50392 Inches, Length: 5.5118 Inches, Weight: 0.7385485777 Pounds, Width: 0.649605 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5118}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.649605}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7385485777}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.50392}}, 'pages': 260, 'date_published': '2007-03-01', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Business & Professional Growth', 'Leadership', 'Ministry & Evangelism', 'Discipleship', 'Business & Money', 'Management & Leadership', 'Leadership & Motivation', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies'], 'authors': ['Ken Blanchard'], 'title': 'Lead Like Jesus: Lessons from the Greatest Leadership Role Model of All Time', 'isbn13': '9780849918728', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0849918723', 'isbn10': '0849918723'}}
