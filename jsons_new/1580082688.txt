Never one to be content with yesterday’s baking triumph, however, Peter continues to refine his recipes and techniques in his never-ending quest for extraordinary bread.<br/><br/>In The Bread Baker’s Apprentice, Peter shares his latest bread breakthroughs, arising from his study in several of France’s famed boulangeries and the always-enlightening time spent in the culinary academy kitchen with his students. Peer over Peter’s shoulder as he learns from Paris’s most esteemed bakers, like Lionel Poilâne and Phillippe Gosselin, whose pain à l’ancienne has revolutionized the art of baguette making. Then stand alongside his students in the kitchen as Peter teaches the classic twelve stages of building bread, his clear instructions accompanied by over 100 step-by-step photographs.<br/><br/>You’ll put newfound knowledge into practice with 50 new master formulas for such classic breads as rustic ciabatta, hearty pain de campagne, old-school New York bagels, and the book’s Holy Grail–Peter’s version of the famed pain à l’ancienne. En route, Peter distills hard science, advanced techniques, and food history into a remarkably accessible and engaging resource that is as rich and multitextured as<br/>the loaves you’ll turn out. This is original food writing at its most captivating, teaching at its most inspired and inspiring–and the rewards are some of the best breads under the sun.<br/><br/>— Food52, Most Anticipated Cookbooks<br/>— Every Day with Rachael Ray, Round-Up', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/86/9781580082686.jpg', 'title_long': "The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.28 Inches, Length: 9.4 Inches, Weight: 3.21433977996 Pounds, Width: 1.05 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.05}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.21433977996}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.28}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2001-11-14', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Baking', 'Bread', 'Regional & International', 'European', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Science & Math', 'Agricultural Sciences', 'Food Science'], 'authors': ['Peter Reinhart'], 'title': "The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread", 'isbn13': '9781580082686', 'msrp': 19.98, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1580082688', 'isbn10': '1580082688'}}
