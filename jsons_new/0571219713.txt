{'book': {'publisher': 'Faber and Faber', 'synopsis': "At an exclusive boarding school, a sixteen-year-old girl records her most intimate thoughts in a diary. The object of her growing obsession is her roommate, Lucy Blake, and Lucy's friendship with her new and disturbing classmate. Ernessa is a mysterious, moody presence with pale skin and hypnotic eyes. Around her swirl dark rumours, suspicions and secrets as well as a series of ominous disasters. As fear spreads through the school, what is true and what is dreamed bleed together into a waking nightmare of gothic menace, fuelled by the anxieties, lusts and fears of adolescence. At the centre of the diary is the question that haunts all who read it: Is Ernessa really a vampire? Or has the narrator trapped herself in her own fevered imagination?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/11/9780571219711.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Moth Diaries', 'edition': "Children's Ed", 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75589 Inches, Length: 4.96062 Inches, Weight: 0.440924524 Pounds, Width: 0.62992 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.96062}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.62992}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.440924524}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75589}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors': ['Rachel Klein'], 'title': 'The Moth Diaries', 'isbn13': '9780571219711', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0571219713', 'isbn10': '0571219713'}}
