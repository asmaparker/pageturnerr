{'book': {'publisher': 'Plexus Publishing', 'synopsis': "Marilyn Manson's fixations with death, drugs, and the devil have made him the living embodiment of the evils of rock and roll among concerned parents and Christian fundamentalists \x97 and wildly popular with his mostly teenage audience. Dissecting Marilyn Manson explores the full scope of the Manson mystique, revealing what makes him tick and why so many fans find his image and music utterly compelling. Heavily visual in its approach, the book forms a pathological scrapbook, cutting through the Manson persona in an irreverent yet authoritative fashion. Each chapter peels back layers of rumor and hearsay to examine the influences, obsessions, and events that reveal the true anatomy of the androgynous superstar. This new edition offers the legions of Marilyn Manson fans an alternative perspective on his macabre world, from his quiet, normal childhood spent with devout Christian parents to his upcoming marriage with fetish model Dita Von Teese.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/25/9780859653725.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dissecting Marilyn Manson', 'edition': 'paperback / softback', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'Musical Genres'], 'authors': ['Gavin Baddeley'], 'title': 'Dissecting Marilyn Manson', 'isbn13': '9780859653725', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Unknown Binding', 'isbn': '0859653722', 'isbn10': '0859653722'}}
