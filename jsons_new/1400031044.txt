He is torn between two identities, the one consecrated to God, the other devoted only to art and his imagination, and in time, his artistic gift threatens to estrange him from that world and the parents he adores.<br/><br/>As it follows his struggle, My Name Is Asher Lev becomes a luminous, visionary portrait of the artist, by turns heartbreaking and exultant.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/47/9781400031047.jpg', 'title_long': 'My Name Is Asher Lev', 'edition': 'Edition Unstated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.18 Inches, Weight: 0.7 Pounds, Width: 0.82 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.18}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.82}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.7}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 369, 'date_published': '2003-03-11', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'World Literature', 'Jewish', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Chaim Potok'], 'title': 'My Name Is Asher Lev', 'isbn13': '9781400031047', 'msrp': 12.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307422348', 'ePub': '0307422348'}, 'isbn': '1400031044', 'isbn10': '1400031044', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307422347', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
