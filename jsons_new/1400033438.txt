{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'Sula and Nel are born in the Bottom—a small town at the top of a hill. Sula is wild, and daring; she does what she wants, while Nel is well-mannered, a mamma’s girl with a questioning heart. Growing up they forge a bond stronger than anything, stronger even than the dark secret they have to bear. Strong enough, it seems, to last a lifetime—until, decades later, as the girls become women, Sula’s anarchy leads to a betrayal that may be beyond forgiveness.<br/><br/>One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years<br/><br/>Masterful, richly textured, bittersweet, and vital, Sula is a modern masterpiece about love and kinship, about living in an America birthed from slavery. Nobel Prize laureate Toni Morrison gives life to characters who struggle with what society tells them to be, and the love they long for and crave as Black women. Most of all, they ask: When can we let go? What must we hold back? And just how much can be shared in a friendship?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/30/9781400033430.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sula', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.95 Inches, Length: 5.19 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.53 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.53}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.95}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2004-06-08', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'United States', 'Black & African American', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Toni Morrison'], 'title': 'Sula', 'isbn13': '9781400033430', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307388131', 'ePub': '0307388131'}, 'isbn': '1400033438', 'isbn10': '1400033438', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307388131', 'binding': 'printisbn'}, {'isbn': '9781588369253', 'binding': 'e'}]}}
