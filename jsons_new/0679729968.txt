He has style as quick and efficient as a flick-knife, and a gift for the grotesque that makes other people\'s nightmares look like Victorian watercolours”—Sunday Times<br/><br/>An ex-circus strongman, veteran of Warsaw, 1939, and Notting Hill rough-justice artist, meets his own personal holocaust and \'Einsteinian\' destiny; maximum boredom and minimum love-making are advised in a 2020 epidemic; a virulent new strain of schizophrenia overwhelms the young son of a \'father of the nuclear age\'; evolution takes a rebarbative turn in a Kafkaesque love story; and the history of the earth is frankly discussed by one who has witnessed it all.<br/><br/>The stories in this collection form a unity and reveal a deep preoccupation: \'"Einstein\'s Monsters" refers to nuclear weapons but also to ourselves,\' writes Amis in his enlightening introductory essay, \'We are Einstein\'s monsters: not fully human, not for now.\'<br/><br/>“Amis is first-rate; arguing inventing, demonstrating, parodying, being funny and shocking in the same breath”—Observer', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/69/9780679729969.jpg', 'title_long': "Einstein's Monsters", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.17 Inches, Weight: 0.3000050461296 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.17}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.45}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3000050461296}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.96}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '1990-03-17', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Martin Amis'], 'title': "Einstein's Monsters", 'isbn13': '9780679729969', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0679729968', 'isbn10': '0679729968'}}
