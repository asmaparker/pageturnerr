{'book': {'publisher': 'Harpercollins Pub Ltd', 'synopsis': 'The winner of THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD, the New York Times No. 1 Bestseller and the worldwide literary sensation, The Corrections has established itself as a truly great American novel. The Lamberts -- Enid and Alfred and their three grown-up children -- are a troubled family living in a troubled age. Alfred is ill and as his condition worsens the whole family must face the failures, secrets and long-buried hurts that haunt them if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs. Stretching from the Midwest in the mid-century to Wall Street and Eastern Europe in the age of globalised greed, The Corrections brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty into wild collision with the era of home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and New Economy millionaires. It announces Jonathan Franzen as one of the most brilliant interpreters of American society and the American soul.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/36/9781841156736.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Corrections', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0 Inches, Length: 0 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 0 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0}}, 'pages': 672, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Jonathan Franzen'], 'title': 'The Corrections', 'isbn13': '9781841156736', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1841156736', 'isbn10': '1841156736'}}
