{'book': {'publisher': 'Broadway Books', 'synopsis': 'On the heels of her national bestsellers Jemima J and Mr. Maybe, British sensation Jane Green delivers a sparkling tale of old friends reunited and old jealousies rekindled.<br/><br/>Catherine Warner and Simon Nelson are best friends: total opposites, always together, and both unlucky in love. Cath is scatterbrained, messy, and–since she had her heart broken a few years back–emotionally closed off. Si is impossibly tidy, bitchy, and desperate for a man of his own. They live in London’s West Hampstead along with their lifelong friends, Josh and Lucy, who are happily married with a devil-spawn child and a terrifying Swedish nanny, Ingrid.<br/><br/>All’s well (sort of) until the sudden arrival of a college friend–the stunningly beautiful Portia, who’s known for breaking hearts. Though they’ve grown up and grown apart from Portia, the four friends welcome her back into the fold. But does Portia have a hidden agenda or is she merely looking to reconnect with old friends? Her reappearance soon unleashes a rollicking series of events that tests the foursome’s friendships to the limit and leaves them wondering if a happy ending is in store.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Cath has plenty to take her mind off Portia’s schemes–like her gutsy decision to leave her job in advertising to fulfill her dream of opening a bookstore. And then there’s James, the sexy real-estate agent who keeps dropping by even after the bookstore deal is done. With his irresistible smile and boyish charm could he be the one to melt Cath’s heart?<br/><br/>Told with Jane Green’s captivating wit and flare, Bookends is above all a story about friendship–its twists, turns and complications–and how it weathers the challenges of love, ambition, marriage, and, most of all, growing up. Warmhearted, sophisticated, and full of delicious surprises, Bookends is Green’s most dazzling novel yet.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/78/04/9780767907804.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bookends: A Novel', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.54 Inches, Length: 5.78 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 1.23 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.78}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.23}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.54}}, 'pages': 358, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors': ['Jane Green'], 'title': 'Bookends: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780767907804', 'msrp': 21, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0767911342'}, 'isbn': '0767907809', 'isbn10': '0767907809', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780767911344', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
