Now Karyn Monk offers her most enthralling romance ever: a tale of a shattered hero fighting for redemption--and fighting for love...<br/><br/>Ariella MacKendrick knew her people had only one hope for survival: she must find the mighty warrior known as the Black Wolf and bring him home to defend<br/>her clan. But when Ariella finally tracks him down, Malcolm MacFane is nothing like the hero she dreamed he would be.<br/><br/>The fearless laird who once led a thousand men is a drunken shell of his former self, scarred inside and out, with no army in sight. Yet Ariella has no choice but to put her trust in MacFane. And soon something begins to stir in the fallen legend. A fire still rages in his warrior heart--a passion that could lead them into battle...a desire, barely leashed, that could brand a Highland beauty's soul.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/27/9780553574227.jpg', 'title_long': 'Once a Warrior: A Novel (The Warriors)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.89 Inches, Length: 4.27 Inches, Weight: 0.41226442994 Pounds, Width: 1.06 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.27}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.06}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41226442994}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.89}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '1997-03-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Medieval', 'Scottish', 'Action & Adventure', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Karyn Monk'], 'title': 'Once a Warrior: A Novel (The Warriors)', 'isbn13': '9780553574227', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0553903284'}, 'isbn': '0553574221', 'isbn10': '0553574221', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780553903287', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
