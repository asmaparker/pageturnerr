Storylines both conventional and outlandish reveal humdrum routines as menacing, or imaginary worlds as perfectly familiar. Allusions to authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Jules Verne reinforce the fantasy tradition in these tales, while understated humor and moments of sadness add a quirky unpredictability. Also included is the previously unpublished novella, "Botch Town," a coming-of-age story about a boy on Long Island whose family and friends live ordinary lives under threats both real and imagined. Each story is followed by a brief afterword that details its genesis.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/95/9781930846395.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Empire of Ice Cream', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.18829159218 Pounds, Width: 1.22 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.22}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.18829159218}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 300, 'date_published': '2006-04-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Jeffrey Ford'], 'title': 'The Empire of Ice Cream', 'isbn13': '9781930846395', 'msrp': 14.38, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1930846398', 'isbn10': '1930846398'}}
