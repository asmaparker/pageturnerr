The trials of raising her teenage children and caring for her sick father have worn her down, but at the request of a friend and in hopes of respite, she's gone to the coastal village of Rodanthe in North Carolina to tend the local inn for the weekend. With a major storm brewing, the time away doesn't look promising...until a guest named Paul Flanner arrives.<br/><br/>At 54, Paul is a successful surgeon, but in the previous six months his life has unraveled into something he doesn't recognize. Estranged from his son and recently divorced, he's sold his practice and his home and has journeyed to this isolated town in hopes of closing a painful chapter in his past. Adrienne and Paul come together as the storm brews over Rodanthe, but what begins between them over the weekend will resonate throughout the rest of their lives, intertwining past and future, love and loss.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17/96/9780446691796.jpg', 'title_long': 'Nights in Rodanthe', 'edition': '1st Thus.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.125 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.625 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.625}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2003-07', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Small Town & Rural', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Nicholas Sparks'], 'title': 'Nights in Rodanthe', 'isbn13': '9780446691796', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0446691798', 'isbn10': '0446691798'}}
