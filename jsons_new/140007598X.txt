{'book': {'publisher': 'Anchor', 'synopsis': 'A TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR<br/><br/>Drawing on an exceptional combination of skills as literary biographer, novelist, and chronicler of London history, Peter Ackroyd surely re-creates the world that shaped Shakespeare--and brings the playwright himself into unusually vivid focus. With characteristic narrative panache, Ackroyd immerses us in sixteenth-century Stratford and the rural landscape–the industry, the animals, even the flowers–that would appear in Shakespeare’s plays. He takes us through Shakespeare’s London neighborhood and the fertile, competitive theater world where he worked as actor and writer. He shows us Shakespeare as a businessman, and as a constant reviser of his writing. In joining these intimate details with profound intuitions about the playwright and his work, Ackroyd has produced an altogether engaging masterpiece.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/80/9781400075980.jpg', 'title_long': 'Shakespeare: The Biography', 'edition': 'Reprinted Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.22 Inches, Weight: 1.075 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.22}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.075}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 572, 'date_published': '2006-11-14', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Historical', 'Europe', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'Genres & Styles', 'Regional & Cultural', 'British & Irish', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Peter Ackroyd'], 'title': 'Shakespeare: The Biography', 'isbn13': '9781400075980', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307490823'}, 'isbn': '140007598X', 'isbn10': '140007598X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307490827', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
