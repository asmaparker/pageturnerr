{'book': {'publisher': 'Fawcett', 'synopsis': 'Once it was a swamp. Now Foggy Bottom is swimming with real-estate sharks. When a man is found stabbed to death in this trendy D.C. neighborhood, it is major news. But within forty-eight hours the nation is gripped by a fear that leaves this comparatively small crime in the dark.<br/><br/>Three passenger planes are shot out of the sky. Everywhere–in law enforcement, in the media, and in the most secret realms of government–men and women scramble to find out who shot hand-held missiles at the planes, and why. It is a search that reaches from Moscow to the Pacific Northwest, putting some people’s lives in jeopardy and turning others lives inside out. But no one can guess the truth: that the epicenter of the terrorist outbreak is Washington D.C. . . . and a dead man behind a park bench in a place called Foggy Bottom.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/67/9780449001967.jpg', 'title_long': 'Murder in Foggy Bottom (Capital Crimes)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2002-01-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Spies & Politics', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Margaret Truman'], 'title': 'Murder in Foggy Bottom (Capital Crimes)', 'isbn13': '9780449001967', 'msrp': 3.9, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307416127'}, 'isbn': '0449001962', 'isbn10': '0449001962', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307416124', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
