{'book': {'publisher': 'India Penguin', 'synopsis': "A bestseller when it was originally published nearly a century ago, Wharton's first literary success was set amid the previously unexplored territory of fashionable, turn-of-the-century New York society, an area with which she was intimately familiar.<br/>The tragic love story reveals the destructive effects of wealth and social hypocrisy on Lily Bart, a ravishing beauty. Impoverished but well-born, Lily realizes a secure future depends on her acquiring a wealthy husband. Her downfall begins with a romantic indiscretion, intensifies with an accumulation of gambling debts, and climaxes in a maelstrom of social disasters.<br/>More a tale of social exclusion than of failed love, The House of Mirth reveals Wharton's compelling gifts as a storyteller and her clear-eyed observations of the savagery beneath the well-bred surface of high society. As with The Age of Innocence and Ethan Frome, this novel was also made into a successful motion picture.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/93/9780486420493.jpg', 'title_long': 'My Genius Lunch Box', 'edition': 'unknown', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.66 Inches, Length: 5.9 Inches, Weight: 0.73 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.73}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.66}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2020-07-25', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Quick & Easy', 'Vegetarian & Vegan', 'Non-Vegan Vegetarian'], 'authors': ['Uma Raghuraman'], 'title': 'My Genius Lunch Box', 'isbn13': '9780486420493', 'msrp': 5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0486112691'}, 'isbn': '0486420493', 'isbn10': '0486420493', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486112695', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
