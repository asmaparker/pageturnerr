{'book': {'publisher': 'Farrar, Straus and Giroux', 'synopsis': 'The World Is Flat is Thomas L. Friedman\'s account of the great changes taking place in our time, as lightning-swift advances in technology and communications put people all over the globe in touch as never before--creating an explosion of wealth in India and China, and challenging the rest of us to run even faster just to stay in place. This updated and expanded edition features more than a hundred pages of fresh reporting and commentary, drawn from Friedman\'s travels around the world and across the American heartland--from anyplace where the flattening of the world is being felt.<br/>In The World Is Flat, Friedman at once shows "how and why globalization has now shifted into warp drive" (Robert Wright, Slate) and brilliantly demystifies the new flat world for readers, allowing them to make sense of the often bewildering scene unfolding before their eyes. With his inimitable ability to translate complex foreign policy and economic issues, he explains how the flattening of the world happened at the dawn of the twenty-first century; what it means to countries, companies, communities, and individuals; how governments and societies can, and must, adapt; and why terrorists want to stand in the way. More than ever, The World Is Flat is an essential update on globalization, its successes and discontents, powerfully illuminated by one of our most respected journalists.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/99/9780374292799.jpg', 'title_long': 'The World Is Flat [Updated and Expanded]: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century', 'edition': 'Expanded and Updated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 2.15 Pounds, Width: 1.625 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.625}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 616, 'date_published': '2006-04-18', 'subjects': ['History', 'Engineering & Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Science & Math', 'Technology', 'Social Aspects', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Thomas L.
