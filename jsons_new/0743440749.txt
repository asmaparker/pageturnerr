{'book': {'publisher': 'POCKET BOOKS @', 'synopsis': "A beguiling new collection from one of the acknowledged masters of the short story The Master of storytelling treats us to eighteen brand-new stories and seven previously published but never before collected. Tales of abandoned places and betrayed love; of a house where time has no boundaries; of a faraway planet plagued by an epidemic of sorrow; a wheat field that hides a strangely welcome enemy; the ghosts of dear friends, of errant sons and lost fathers, are but a few of the ingredients that have gone into Bradbury's savoury cocktail. One More for the Road is a superb refreshment served with wit, heart and flair by the incomparable Ray Bradbury.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/45/9780743440745.jpg', 'title_long': 'One More for the Road', 'edition': 'January', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.35 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Ray Bradbury'], 'title': 'One More for the Road', 'isbn13': '9780743440745', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0743440749', 'isbn10': '0743440749'}}
