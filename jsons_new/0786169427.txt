{'book': {'publisher': 'Knowledge Products', 'synopsis': "Jean-Paul Sartre, a French philosopher, is perhaps the best known advocate of existentialism. In this view, no external authority gives life meaning: mankind is radically free and responsible. In every moment we choose ourselves, with no assurance that we have a continuing identity or power. We set up determinisms to ease our minds, but in the face of the finality of death, only through our present consciousness do we establish our own authentic existence. Sartre's existentialism faces the evil in human existence and sees that humans are responsible for it.<br/>The Giants of Philosophy is a series of dramatic presentations, in understandable language, of the concerns, questions, interests, and overall world view of history's greatest philosophers. Special emphasis on clear and relevant explanations gives you a new arsenal of insights toward living a better life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/29/9780786169429.jpg', 'title_long': 'Jean-Paul Sartre: Knowledge Products (Giants of Philosophy) (Audio Classics: The Giants of Philosophy)', 'edition': 'Unabridged', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.66 Inches, Length: 6.48 Inches, Weight: 0.22 Pounds, Width: 0.45 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.48}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.45}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.22}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.66}}, 'pages': 3, 'date_published': '2006-04-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy'], 'authors': ['Charleton Heston Professor John Compton (Narrator)'], 'title': 'Jean-Paul Sartre: Knowledge Products (Giants of Philosophy) (Audio Classics: The Giants of Philosophy)', 'isbn13': '9780786169429', 'msrp': 18, 'binding': 'Audio CD', 'isbn': '0786169427', 'isbn10': '0786169427'}}
