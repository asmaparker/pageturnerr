{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover', 'synopsis': 'While best known for literature\'s greatest, most popular, and most famous vampire novel, Dracula, Bram Stoker also wrote superlative short stories. Indeed, he was a genius at creating horror within the confines of a short tale.<br/>Now readers can sample Stoker\'s mastery in this treasury of fourteen spine-tingling stories. Not all the selections deal with the ghostly and supernatural, but they are always bizarre, and some—like "The Squaw" and "The Burial of the Rats"—are equal to Poe at his best. In addition to these two masterly tales, the collection includes "The Crystal Cup," "The Chain of Destiny," "The Castle of the King," "The Dualists" (probably Stoker\'s most horrifying story), "The Judge\'s House," "The Secret of the Growing Gold," "A Dream of Red Hands," "Crooken Sands," "Dracula\'s Guest," and three more.<br/>Lovers of occult and supernatural fiction will delight in this inexpensive collection of ghost and horror stories, called by Stephen King "absolutely champion short stories."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/71/63/9780486297163.jpg', 'title_long': 'Best Ghost and Horror Stories (Dover Horror Classics)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.5621787681 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5621787681}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2011-11-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal & Urban'], 'authors': ['Bram Stoker'], 'title': 'Best Ghost and Horror Stories (Dover Horror Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780486297163', 'msrp': 9.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '048614321X'}, 'isbn': '0486297160', 'isbn10': '0486297160', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486143217', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
