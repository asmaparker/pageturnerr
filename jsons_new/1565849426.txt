{'book': {'publisher': 'The New Press', 'synopsis': '“A provocative history” of intrigue and class struggle in Ancient Rome―“an important alternative to the usual views of Caesar and the Roman Empire” (Publishers Weekly).<br/><br/>Most historians, both ancient and modern, have viewed the Late Republic of Rome through the eyes of its rich nobility―the 1 percent of the population who controlled 99 percent of the empire’s wealth. In The Assassination of Julius Caesar, Michael Parenti recounts this period, spanning the years 100 to 33 BC, from the perspective of the Roman people. In doing so, he presents a provocative, trenchantly researched narrative of popular resistance against a powerful elite.<br/><br/>As Parenti carefully weighs the evidence concerning the murder of Caesar, he adds essential context to the crime with fascinating details about Roman society as a whole. In these pages, we find reflections on the democratic struggle waged by Roman commoners, religious augury as an instrument of social control, the patriarchal oppression of women, and the political use of homophobic attacks. The Assassination of Julius Caesar offers a whole new perspective on an era thought to be well-known.<br/><br/>“A highly accessible and entertaining addition to history.” ―Book Marks', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/26/9781565849426.jpg', 'title_long': "The Assassination Of Julius Caesar: A People's History Of Ancient Rome (New Press People's History)", 'edition': 'First Edition, 4th Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.72973008722 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.72973008722}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 276, 'date_published': '2004-08-30', 'subjects': ['History', 'Ancient Civilizations', 'Rome', 'Historical Study & Educational Resources', 'Historiography', 'World', 'Slavery & Emancipation'], 'authors': ['Michael Parenti'], 'title': "The Assassination Of Julius Caesar: A People's History Of Ancient Rome (New Press People's History)", 'isbn13': '9781565849426', 'msrp': 14.59, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1565849426', 'isbn10': '1565849426', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781595585561', 'binding': 'ebook'}]}}
