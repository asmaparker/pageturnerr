Want to know how to keep lemon meringue pie from weeping or which type of chocolate makes the best pudding? Want to capture the flavors of a real clambake on top of the stove? To find the answers to these and hundreds more questions, we made 28 lemon meringue pies, chopped our way through pounds of chocolate, and steamed enough clams to feed a small town. In addition, we\x92ve included more than 200 illustrations plus no-nonsense equipment ratings and taste tests of supermarket ingredients.The Best American Classics features more than 300 recipes that cover the wide range of American cooking. Choose from favorite regional dishes such as Chicago deep-dish pizza, New Orleans\x92 legendary red beans and rice, or New York cheesecake. Or select beloved family fare like chicken pot pie, glazed meatloaf, and green bean casserole. Restaurant classics are here as well, from Parker House rolls and Waldorf salad to bananas foster. The Best American Classics celebrates the breadth of our cuisine with foolproof recipes that will stand the test of time.Real Boston Baked Beans that are worth the wait If you want to make Boston baked beans that are a cut above the tourist variety, you\x92ll need salt pork and bacon for authentic smoky flavor. And for best results, bake the beans for five hours, leaving the cover off the pot during the final hour to thicken the sauce to just the right consistency.Stovetop Mac \x92n Cheese that\x92s Silky Not Sticky This all-around family favorite appears in more guises than just about any other comfort food on the planet. But the best recipe, we found, is made on the stovetop (not baked) and uses evaporated milk in the sauce (not a fussy béchamel). All-American Meatloaf that\x92s Crusty and Glazed Not Soggy For the best meatloaf, use a mix of meats (beef, pork, and veal). Then, select the right binders: cracker crumbs and breadcrumbs don\x92t mask the flavor of the meat. Lastly, bake the loaf free-form (so it doesn\x92t get soggy) and give it a double dose of glaze.Strawberry Shortcake That Tastes as Good as it Looks For a juicy filling that stays put between the biscuits, choose the ripest berries and then mash some of them into a chunky sauce and slice the rest. Left to sit with a little sugar, the mixture macerates, making a thick filling that soaks into the tender, easy-to-make biscuits.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/35/9781933615035.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Best American Classics (Best Recipe)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.75 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 2.5 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.75}}, 'pages': 421, 'date_published': '2006-09-01', 'subjects': ['Cookbooks, Food & Wine', 'Regional & International', 'U.S. Regional', 'Entertaining & Holidays', 'Holidays'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'The Best American Classics (Best Recipe)', 'isbn13': '9781933615035', 'msrp': 19.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1933615036', 'isbn10': '1933615036'}}
