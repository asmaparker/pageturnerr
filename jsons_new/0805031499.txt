{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "If humanity cannot live with the dangers and responsibilities inherent in freedom, it will probably turn to authoritarianism. This is the central idea of Escape from Freedom, a landmark work by one of the most distinguished thinkers of our time, and a book that is as timely now as when first published in 1941. Few books have thrown such light upon the forces that shape modern society or penetrated so deeply into the causes of authoritarian systems. If the rise of democracy set some people free, at the same time it gave birth to a society in which the individual feels alienated and dehumanized. Using the insights of psychoanalysis as probing agents, Fromm's work analyzes the illness of contemporary civilization as witnessed by its willingness to submit to totalitarian rule.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/92/9780805031492.jpg', 'title_long': 'Escape from Freedom', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.1999836 Inches, Length: 5.4499891 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.8499983 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.4499891}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8499983}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.1999836}}, 'pages': 301, 'date_published': '1994-09-15', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Social Psychology & Interactions', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Behavioral Psychology', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Movements', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Erich Fromm'], 'title': 'Escape from Freedom', 'isbn13': '9780805031492', 'msrp': 19, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0805031499', 'isbn10': '0805031499'}}
