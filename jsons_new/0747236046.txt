{'book': {'publisher': 'Headline Book Publishing', 'synopsis': "On the world called Hyperion the mysterious Time Tombs are opening and seven pilgrims risk their lives to petition the entity called the Shrike - a creature that may well control the fate of all mankind.<br/><br/>The Hegemony of Man - a thousand thousand worlds linked by a network of farcaster portals and high-tech gateways - is under siege by Ousters, strange, half-human tribes mutated almost beyond recognition.<br/><br/>The AIs - Artificial Intelligences whose synthetic wisdom created and maintains the nets that bind the Hegemony - have become a threat; it seems they have turned against the Hegemony and all mankind. And there is evidence that they have begun a project to create the Ultimate Intelligence - to build, in short, God. God of Machines: the ultimate deus ex machina. His genesis may well mean man's annihilation.<br/><br/>Something is drawing the Hegemony, the AIs, the Ousters, and indeed the entire universe, towards the Shrike and the Time Tombs from which it has arisen. In a moment the paths of man, machine and god will intersect. Nothing will ever be the same.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/47/9780747236047.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Fall of Hyperion', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.37795 Inches, Length: 4.37007 Inches, Weight: 0.69225150268 Pounds, Width: 7.04723 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.37007}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.04723}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.69225150268}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.37795}}, 'pages': 640, 'date_published': '1992', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Epic'], 'authors': ['Dan Simmons'], 'title': 'The Fall of Hyperion', 'isbn13': '9780747236047', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0747236046', 'isbn10': '0747236046'}}
