{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'Whether they are Americans, Brits, or a stubborn and suicidally moral Dutchman, Norman Rush’s whites are not sure why they are in Botswana. Their uncertainty makes them do odd things. Driven half-mad by the barking of his neighbor’s dogs, Carl dips timidly into native witchcraft—only to jump back out at the worst possible moment. Ione briskly pursues a career as a “seducer” (“A seductress was merely someone who was seductive and who might or might not be awarded a victory. But a seducer was a professional”), while her dentist husband fends off the generous advances of an African cook. Funny, sad, and deeply knowing, polished throughout to a diamond glitter, Whites is a magnificent collection of stories.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/81/69/9780679738169.jpg', 'title_long': 'Whites', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.13 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.43 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.13}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.43}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '1992-09-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Norman Rush'], 'title': 'Whites', 'isbn13': '9780679738169', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307789373'}, 'isbn': '0679738169', 'isbn10': '0679738169', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307789372', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
