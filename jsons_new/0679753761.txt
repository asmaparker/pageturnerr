But, despite his Harvard training, he can barely understand, let alone "study," the culture he encounters. From his struggles with the local cuisine to his affair with the Danish woman the locals want him to marry, Jonathan is both repelled by and drawn into the Faroese way of life. Wry and insightful, Far Afield reveals Susanna Kaysen\'s gifts of imagination, satire, and compassion.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/66/9780679753766.jpg', 'title_long': 'Far Afield', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.78}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.97}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '1994-04-19', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'Small Town & Rural', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Susanna Kaysen'], 'title': 'Far Afield', 'isbn13': '9780679753766', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0804151075'}, 'isbn': '0679753761', 'isbn10': '0679753761', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780804151078', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
