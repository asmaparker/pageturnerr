{'book': {'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'synopsis': "This is the first edition ever published of Trimalchio, an early and complete version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald wrote the novel as Trimalchio and submitted it to Maxwell Perkins, his editor at Scribner's, who had the novel set in type and sent the galleys to Fitzgerald in France. Fitzgerald then virtually rewrote the novel in galleys, producing the book we know as The Great Gatsby. This first version, Trimalchio, has never been published and has only been read by a handful of people. It is markedly different from The Great Gatsby: two chapters were completely rewritten for the published novel, and the rest of the book was heavily revised. Characterization is different, the narrative voice of Nick Carraway is altered and, most importantly, the revelation of Jay Gatsby's past is handled in a wholly different way. James L.W. West III directs the Penn State Center for the History of the Book and is General Editor of the Cambridge Edition of the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He is the author of William Styron: A Descriptive Biography (Random House, 1998).", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/72/9780521890472.jpg', 'title_long': 'f-scott-fitzgerald', 'edition': 'First Paperback Edition.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.43 Inches, Weight: 0.5732018812 Pounds, Width: 0.54 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.43}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.54}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5732018812}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 216, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Classics', 'Literary', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing'], 'authors': ['F.
