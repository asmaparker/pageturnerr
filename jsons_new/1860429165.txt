His first three Reacher novels, Killing Floor, Die Trying and Tripwire, were published to great acclaim; Killing Floor was recently awarded the Anthony Award in America for the Best First Novel, and Die Trying was selected as a Thumping Good Read by W.H. Smith in the U.K. Lee was also cited as one of the current hot talents in crime writing by Mark Timlin at the crime writers' festival, Dead On Deansgate.<br/><br/>It's tough being a high-flying woman in the Army. Very tough. When Sergeant Amy Callan and Lieutenant Caroline Cook are found dead in their own homes—in baths filled with Army-issue camouflage paint, their bodies completely unmarked—Jack Reacher is under suspicion. He knew them both—and he knows that they both left the Army under dubious circumstances, both victims of sexual harassment. A former U.S. military policeman, a loner and a drifter, he matches the psychological profile prepared by the FBI, and is arrested by ambitious Special Agent, Julia Lamarr.<br/><br/>But when the body of another woman, Sergeant Lorraine Stanley, is discovered, killed with similar precision, Reacher is released. Everyone fears there is a serial killer on the loose. But the FBI have strong persuasive powers, and before long Reacher finds himself heavily involved in the murder investigation. What have these women got in common and why is someone out to do them harm?<br/><br/>In this magnificent and utterly ingenious thriller, Reacher once again saves the day, proving that he is a unique hero, capable of holding his own in any situation. Running Blind confirms that Lee Child is more than capable of challenging the established names currently writing in this genre.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/63/9781860429163.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Visitor (Jack Reacher)', 'edition': '12', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 1.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 14, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure'], 'authors': ['Lee Child'], 'title': 'The Visitor (Jack Reacher)', 'isbn13': '9781860429163', 'msrp': 99.95, 'binding': 'Audio CD', 'isbn': '1860429165', 'isbn10': '1860429165'}}
