{'book': {'publisher': 'Free Press', 'synopsis': 'In the perfect match of subject and author, John S. D. Eisenhower, a noted military historian, presents the definitive account of the birth of the modern Amer- ican army and its decisive role in World War I. With the help of his wife Joanne, Eisenhower captures the viewpoints of the actual participants, blending a narrative told from the perspective of top officers with the stories of average soldiers. Drawing on diaries and memoirs, he brings each engagement to life, from the initial planning to the actual battlefield experiences of soldiers whose exploits at Belleau Woods and along the Meuse-Argonne would become the stuff of legend.<br/>Along the way, he shows how General Pershing and other leaders -- including George Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, Billy Mitchell, and Peyton March -- transformed the American Expeditionary Force from a small, underequipped force into a strong, efficient, and effective army. Fast-paced, lively, and engaging, Yanks illuminates the central role of the American army in turning the tide in the biggest war the world had ever known.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/50/9780743223850.jpg', 'title_long': 'Yanks: The Epic Story of the American Army in World War I', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.06483272546 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.06483272546}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2002-06-04', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'Military', 'World War I'], 'authors': ['John Eisenhower'], 'title': 'Yanks: The Epic Story of the American Army in World War I', 'isbn13': '9780743223850', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0743216377'}, 'isbn': '0743223853', 'isbn10': '0743223853', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780743216371', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
