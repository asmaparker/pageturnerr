{'book': {'publisher': 'Yale University Press', 'synopsis': 'Winner of the 1957 Pulitzer Prize in Drama<br/><br/>“The definitive edition.”—Boston Globe<br/><br/>Eugene O’Neill’s autobiographical play Long Day’s Journey into Night is regarded as his finest work. First published by Yale University Press in 1956, it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957 and has since sold more than one million copies. This edition includes a Foreword by Harold Bloom, in which he writes: “By common consent, Long Day’s Journey into Night is Eugene O’Neill’s masterpiece. . . . The helplessness of family love to sustain, let alone heal, the wounds of marriage, of parenthood, and of sonship, have never been so remorselessly and so pathetically portrayed, and with a force of gesture too painful ever to be forgotten by any of us.”', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/56/9780300093056.jpg', 'title_long': "Long Day's Journey into Night", 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.35 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 192, 'date_published': '2002-03-01', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing'], 'authors': ["Eugene O'Neill"], 'title': "Long Day's Journey into Night", 'isbn13': '9780300093056', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0300166222'}, 'isbn': '0300093055', 'isbn10': '0300093055', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780300166224', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
