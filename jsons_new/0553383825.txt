{'book': {'publisher': 'Dial Press Trade Paperback', 'synopsis': 'Conceived in an embrace designed to comfort a dying man, born to a servant and raised as a hired hand, Eva Luna learns quickly that she has a talent that belies her humble start: the gift of storytelling. As the years pass and her imprudent nature sends Eva from household to household—from the home of a doctor famed for mummifying the dead to a colorful whorehouse and the care of a beautiful transsexual—it is Eva’s magical imagination that keeps her alive and fuels her ardent encounters with lovers of all kinds. And as her South American homeland teeters on the brink of political chaos, and Eva’s fate is intertwined with guerrilla fighters and revolutionaries, she will find her life’s calling—and the soul mate who will envelop her in a love entirely beyond her mystical inventions.<br/><br/>Eva Luna is a literary triumph, a novel brimming with battles and passions, rebellions and reunions—and some of the most exquisite characters Isabel Allende has ever created.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/29/9780553383829.jpg', 'title_long': 'Eva Luna: A Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.17 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.67 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.17}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.67}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2005-08-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Isabel Allende'], 'title': 'Eva Luna: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780553383829', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0553383825', 'isbn10': '0553383825'}}
