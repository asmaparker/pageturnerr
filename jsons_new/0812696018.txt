{'book': {'publisher': 'Open Court Publishing Company', 'synopsis': 'Though Bram Stoker coined the term, the undead have stalked the human imagination for eons, appearing in the myths and legends of nearly all cultures. The concept of people, or unpeople, interacting with others while devoid of humanity provides a wealth of material for philosophical speculation. Encompassing George Romero’s radiation-spawned Living Dead, the "infected” of 28 Days Later, as well as more traditional zombies and vampires, the essays in The Undead and Philosophy ponder questions such as: Is it cool to be undead, or does it totally suck? Is a zombie simply someone with a brain but without a mind? Are some of the people around us undead, and how could we tell? Can the undead be held responsible for what they do? Is it always morally OK to kill the undead? Served up in a witty, entertaining style, these and other provocative questions present philosophical arguments in terms accessible to all readers.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/11/9780812696011.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Undead and Philosophy: Chicken Soup for the Soulless', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.9 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}}, 'pages': 261, 'date_published': '2006', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Movements'], 'authors': ['Richard Greene'], 'title': 'The Undead and Philosophy: Chicken Soup for the Soulless', 'isbn13': '9780812696011', 'msrp': 14.39, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0812696018', 'isbn10': '0812696018'}}
