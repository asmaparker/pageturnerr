{'book': {'publisher': 'Berkley', 'synopsis': "Sparks fly and twists abound in this electrifying thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling crime author Patricia Cornwell.<br/><br/>Massachusetts state investigator Win Garano is called home from Knoxville, Tennessee, where he is completing a course at the National Forensic Academy. His boss, the district attorney, attractive but hard-charging, is planning to run for governor, and as a showcase she's planning to use a new crime initiative called At Risk—its motto: “Any crime, any time.” In particular, she's been looking for a way to employ cutting-edge DNA technology, and she thinks she’s found the perfect subject in an unsolved twenty-year-old murder in Tennessee. If her office solves the case, it ought to make them all look pretty good, right?<br/><br/>Win isn't so sure—not sure about anything to do with this woman, really—but before he can open his mouth, a shocking piece of violence intervenes, an act that shakes up both their lives and the lives of everyone around them. It's not a random event. Is it personal? Is it professional? Whatever it is, the implications are very, very bad indeed...and they're about to get much worse.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/63/9780425214763.jpg', 'title_long': 'At Risk (Win Garano)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.8 Inches, Length: 4.2 Inches, Weight: 0.31 Pounds, Width: 0.75 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.31}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.8}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2007-04-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Medical', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Patricia Cornwell'], 'title': 'At Risk (Win Garano)', 'isbn13': '9780425214763', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0425214761', 'isbn10': '0425214761'}}
