{'book': {'publisher': 'Ballantine Books', 'synopsis': 'On the East Anglican seacoast a small theological college hangs precariously on an eroding shoreline and an equally precarious future. Then, the body of a student is found buried in the sand, and the boy’s influential father demands that Scotland Yard investigate. Adam Dalgleish, the son of a parson, once spent happy summers at the school. A detective who loves poetry, a man who has known loss and discovery, Dalgliesh is the perfect candidate to look for the truth in a remote, rarified community of the faithful–and the frightened. For when one death leads to another, Dalgliesh finds himself steeped in a world of good and evil, of stifled passions and hidden pasts, where someone has cause not just to commit one crime, but to begin an unholy order of murder. . . .', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/64/9780345446664.jpg', 'title_long': 'Death in Holy Orders (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #11)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.88 Inches, Length: 4.17 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1.16 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.17}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.16}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.88}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2002-03-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['P.
