We hear Romanian-born Marcus Ravage's disappointment when his aunt pushes him outside to peddle chocolates on the street. And about the pickle cart lady who stored her pickles in a rat-infested basement. We read Rose Cohen's terrifying account of living through the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, and of Pauline Newman's struggles to learn English. But through it all, each one of these kids keeps working, keeps hoping, to achieve their own American dream.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/59/00/9780439375900.jpg', 'title_long': 'Shutting Out the Sky', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 8.25 Inches, Weight: 1.2 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '2003-10-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'History', 'United States', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Difficult Discussions', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Sociology', 'Urban'], 'authors': ['Deborah Hopkinson'], 'title': 'Shutting Out the Sky', 'isbn13': '9780439375900', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0439375908', 'isbn10': '0439375908'}}
