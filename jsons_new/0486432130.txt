{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': 'One of the towering figures of Russian literature, Fyodor Dostoyevsky depicted with remarkable insight the depth and complexity of the human soul. In this literary classic, he focuses on Prince Myshkin â€” a nobleman whose gentle, child-like nature, and refusal to be offended by anything has earned him the nickname of "the idiot."<br/>Returning to Russia from Switzerland, where he underwent medical treatment for a number of years, Myshkin learns of his benefactor\'s death, finds himself heir to a large fortune, and without instigation, becomes entangled in the intrigues of a corrupt ruling class.<br/>A superb, panoramic view of 19th-century Russian manners, morals, and philosophy, The Idiot remains a provocative example of psychological realism.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21/37/9780486432137.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Idiot (Dover Thrift Editions)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 544, 'date_published': '2003-12-12', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Fyodor Dostoyevsky'], 'title': 'The Idiot (Dover Thrift Editions)', 'isbn13': '9780486432137', 'msrp': 5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0486114538', 'ePub': '0486114538'}, 'isbn': '0486432130', 'isbn10': '0486432130', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486114538', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
