{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Books', 'synopsis': "A sweeping, gorgeously written novel of Lewis and Clark's legendary expedition, named one of the best novels of the year by The Boston Globe, Salon, The Los Angeles Times, and The Christian Science Monitor.<br/><br/>Brian Hall’s compulsively readable novel vividly re-creates Lewis and Clark’s extraordinary journey into the unknown western frontier. Focusing on the emblematic moments of the participants’ lives, the story unfolds through the perspectives of four competing voices—from the troubled and mercurial figure of Meriwether Lewis, the expedition leader who found that it was impossible to enter paradise without having it crumble around him, to Sacagawea, the Shoshone girl-captive and interpreter for the expedition, whose short life mirrored the disruptive times in which she lived. Bringing the day-to-day life of the expedition alive as no work of history ever could, Hall’s magnificent novel fills in the gaps and provides a new perspective on the most famous journey in American history.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/18/9780142003718.jpg', 'title_long': 'I Should Be Extremely Happy in Your Company: A Novel of Lewis and Clark', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.4 Inches, Length: 5.48 Inches, Weight: 0.88 Pounds, Width: 0.91 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.48}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.91}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.88}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.4}}, 'pages': 432, 'date_published': '2003-12-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Biographical', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Brian Hall'], 'title': 'I Should Be Extremely Happy in Your Company: A Novel of Lewis and Clark', 'isbn13': '9780142003718', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0142003719', 'isbn10': '0142003719'}}
