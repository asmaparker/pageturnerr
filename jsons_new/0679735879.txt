Instead, he finds himself diverted on a series of cryptic and infuriating errands that nevertheless provide him with vital clues to his own past. In The Unconsoled Ishiguro creates a work that is itself a virtuoso performance, strange, haunting, and resonant with humanity and wit.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/78/9780679735878.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Unconsoled The Unconsoled', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 535, 'date_published': '1996', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Kazuo Ishiguro'], 'title': 'The Unconsoled The Unconsoled', 'isbn13': '9780679735878', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '030776415X'}, 'isbn': '0679735879', 'isbn10': '0679735879', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307764157', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
