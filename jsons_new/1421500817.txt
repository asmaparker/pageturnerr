{'book': {'publisher': 'VIZ Media LLC', 'synopsis': "Part-time student, full-time Soul Reaper, Ichigo is one of the chosen few guardians of the afterlife.<br/><br/>Ichigo Kurosaki never asked for the ability to see ghosts—he was born with the gift. When his family is attacked by a Hollow—a malevolent lost soul—Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper, dedicating his life to protecting the innocent and helping the tortured spirits themselves find peace. Find out why Tite Kubo’s Bleach has become an international manga smash-hit!<br/><br/>With the help of Kûkaku--a one-armed explosives expert and old friend of the mysterious talking cat Yoruichi--Ichigo and crew are one step closer to infiltrating the Soul Society and rescuing their friend Rukia before she is executed. For Kûkaku's plan to work, Ichigo must control his enormous reservoir of spiritual energy--and there's no telling how much collateral damage this will cause. Meanwhile, the Soul Society hasn't been twiddling their collective thumbs, and quickly dispatches a delegation of captains to give the unwanted visitors the rudest of welcomings imaginable.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/12/9781421500812.jpg', 'title_long': 'Bleach, Volume 10', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.40124131684 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.40124131684}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 200, 'date_published': '2005-12-06', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Action & Adventure', 'Media Tie-In', 'Shonen', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Bleach, Volume 10', 'isbn13': '9781421500812', 'msrp': 6.33, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1421500817', 'isbn10': '1421500817'}}
