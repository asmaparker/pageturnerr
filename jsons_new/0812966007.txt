A hundred years before the catastrophe of September 11, 2001, “TR” succeeded to power in the aftermath of an act of terrorism. Youngest of all our chief executives, he rallied a stricken nation with his superhuman energy, charm, and political skills. He proceeded to combat the problems of race and labor relations and trust control while making the Panama Canal possible and winning the Nobel Peace Prize. But his most historic achievement remains his creation of a national conservation policy, and his monument millions of acres of protected parks and forest.<br/><br/>Theodore Rex ends with TR leaving office, still only fifty years old, his future reputation secure as one of our greatest presidents.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/08/9780812966008.jpg', 'title_long': 'Theodore Rex', 'edition': 'Revised ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.94 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 1.16183612074 Pounds, Width: 1.35 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.35}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.16183612074}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.94}}, 'pages': 792, 'date_published': '2002-10-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Emigrants & Immigrants', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Presidents & Heads of State', 'History', 'Americas', 'World', 'Women in History', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'Public Affairs & Policy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Edmund Morris'], 'title': 'Theodore Rex', 'isbn13': '9780812966008', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307777812'}, 'isbn': '0812966007', 'isbn10': '0812966007', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307777812', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
