A cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America.<br/><br/>Written during the Great Depression, when the country was largely oblivious to Hitler’s aggression, it juxtaposes sharp political satire with the chillingly realistic rise of a president who becomes a dictator to save the nation from welfare cheats, sex, crime, and a liberal press.<br/><br/>Called “a message to thinking Americans” by the Springfield Republican when it was published in 1935, It Can’t Happen Here is a shockingly prescient novel that remains as fresh and contemporary as today’s news.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/88/9780451216588.jpg', 'title_long': "It Can't Happen Here", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.87}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.97}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Sinclair Lewis'], 'title': "It Can't Happen Here", 'isbn13': '9780451216588', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '045121658X', 'isbn10': '045121658X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780698152700', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
