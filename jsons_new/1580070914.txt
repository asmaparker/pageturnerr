{'book': {'publisher': 'Specialty Press', 'synopsis': "Recognized as one of the best fighters of the 1990s, the Su-27 Flanker is a single-seat supersonic interceptor that is often declared the finest and most successful fighter of the Cold War era. Designed by Sukhoi OKB, the imposing fighter quickly gained popularity and respect from countries all across the globe. Intended to be a direct competitor to the new generation of American fighters such as the F-15, the Su-27 was designed with outstanding range, heavy armament, and high agility. Excellent performance, handling, and serviceability have made the aircraft popular with its pilots and ground personnel alike. Equipped with an analog fly-by-wire control system, a full avionics suite, and up to 10 air-to-air missiles, the Flanker also features a rearward-facing radar between the engines, allowing it to fire at targets behind the aircraft. Outfitted with two Lyul'ka AL-31F turbofans, each 12,500 kgp (27,557 lb st) with afterburning, the Su-27's high thrust-to-weight ratio and refined aerodynamics allow superb flight characteristics at high angles of attack. Yefim Gordon and Peter Davison are the authors of several books on Soviet aircraft including the Specialty Press titles Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum and Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-15 Fagot. Over 300 photos illustrate the story of the Su-27. Topics covered include design, development, structural detail, international production, trials, upgrades and generations, comparisons, overseas sales, and much more. This book is a must have for all warbird enthusiasts!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/11/9781580070911.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker - Warbird Tech Vol. 42', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.81 Inches, Length: 8.38 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 0.31 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.38}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.31}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.81}}, 'pages': 104, 'date_published': '2006-04-01', 'subjects': ['History', 'Military', 'Aviation'], 'authors': ['Yefim Gordon'], 'title': 'Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker - Warbird Tech Vol. 42', 'isbn13': '9781580070911', 'msrp': 139.52, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1580070914', 'isbn10': '1580070914'}}
