He grows into a man and starts a family of his own. But one fateful weekend, he leaves his mother to secretly be with his father - and she dies while he is gone. This haunts him for years. It unravels his own young family. It leads him to depression and drunkenness. One night, he decides to take his life. But somewhere between this world and the next, he encounters his mother again, in their hometown, and gets to spend one last day with her - the day he missed and always wished he'd had. He asks the questions many of us yearn to ask, the questions we never ask while our parents are alive. By the end of this magical day, Charley discovers how little he really knew about his mother, the secret of how her love saved their family, and how deeply he wants the second chance to save his own.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/73/9781401303273.jpg', 'title_long': 'For One More Day', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 208, 'date_published': '2006-09-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Metaphysical & Visionary', 'Family Life', 'United States'], 'authors': ['Mitch Albom'], 'title': 'For One More Day', 'isbn13': '9781401303273', 'msrp': 21.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1401303277', 'isbn10': '1401303277', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781401388898', 'binding': 'saleableprint'}]}}
