{'book': {'publisher': 'Forge Books', 'synopsis': "Can an insecure American woman find happiness with a sexy Parisian waiter---<br/>even if she doesn't like the French?<br/><br/>Laura has spent most of her adult life avoiding serious relationships, flitting around the world, and keeping her romantic expectations comfortably low. The last thing she wants is to have her globe-trotting ways curtailed by a messy emotional entanglement. As far as she's concerned, chocolate is just as satisfying as true love--and a lot less complicated.<br/>So how, in the name of all that is romantic, has she managed to get involved with a dangerously charming Frenchman named Sébastien? And only weeks before she's scheduled to leave Paris for good?<br/>Everyone knows that Frenchmen are chain-smoking, manic-depressive, faithless, male chauvinistic, perfectionist snobs. What's worse, they live in France.<br/>The cultural differences alone are enough to kill any relationship, even if Laura wanted one. She's from small-town Georgia. He's a sophisticated Parisian. They go together like grits and escargot.<br/>But Sébastien isn't just any Frenchman. He's a gorgeous, sweet, sexy, graphic artist who seems to find Laura adorable for reasons she can't begin to comprehend. As the days slip by, she's finding it harder and harder to say adieu.<br/>Unless she comes to her senses soon, she could end up ruining her life with a beautiful romance. . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/50/83/9780765315083.jpg', 'title_long': 'Blame It on Paris', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.11 pounds, Width: 0.86 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.86}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.11}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2006-10-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Laura Florand'], 'title': 'Blame It on Paris', 'isbn13': '9780765315083', 'msrp': 26.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0765315084', 'isbn10': '0765315084'}}
