{'book': {'publisher': 'Inter Varsity Pr', 'synopsis': 'Few biblical topics are as important as mission. Mission is linked inextricably to humanity\'s sinfulness and need for redemption, and to God\'s provision of salvation in the person and work of Jesus Christ. This "good news" of salvation must be made known! The saving mission of Jesus constitutes the foundation for Christian mission, and the Christian gospel is its message. According to Andreas Köstenberger and Peter O\'Brien, this significant theme has rarely been given its due attention in biblical theology. Motivated by their passion to see God\'s mission carried out in today\'s world, they offer a comprehensive study of the theme of mission. In Salvation to the Ends of the Earth they explore the entire sweep of biblical history, including the Old Testament, the second-temple period, each New Testament Gospel, Paul and his writings, and the General Epistles and Revelation. Among other questions, Köstenberger and O\'Brien examine whether or not Old Testament Israel was called to mission, whether second-temple Judaism should be characterized as a missionary religion, whether Jesus limited his earthly mission to Israel or also embarked on a Gentile mission, and whether or not there is continuity between the missions of Israel and the missions of Jesus and the early church. They write, "It is our sincere hope that our Christian mission, which is first of all God\'s, will be founded on a biblical theology that takes its cue from the scriptural revelation as a whole." To that end, they offer this work as a service to the worldwide church.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/51/91/9780851115191.jpg', 'title_long': 'Salvation to the Ends of the Earth: A Biblical Theology of Mission (New Studies in Biblical Theology (Intervarsity Press), 11.)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.6614 Inches, Length: 5.5118 Inches, Weight: 1.01 Pounds, Width: 1.02362 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5118}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.02362}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.01}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.6614}}, 'pages': 351, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Theology', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Andreas J.
