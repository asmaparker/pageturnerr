Describing in relentless detail the physical and mental suffering of the convicts, Dostoyevsky\'s character never loses faith in human qualities and the goodness of man.<br/>A haunting and remarkable work filled with wonder and resignation, The House of the Dead ranks among the Russian novelist\'s greatest masterpieces. Of this powerful autobiographical novel, Tolstoy wrote, "I know no better book in all modern literature."', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/94/9780486434094.jpg', 'title_long': 'The House of the Dead (Dover Thrift Editions)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.4299014109 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4299014109}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2004-04-22', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'World Literature', 'Russian & Soviet'], 'authors': ['Fyodor Dostoevsky'], 'title': 'The House of the Dead (Dover Thrift Editions)', 'isbn13': '9780486434094', 'msrp': 8, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0486115216'}, 'isbn': '0486434095', 'isbn10': '0486434095', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486115214', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
