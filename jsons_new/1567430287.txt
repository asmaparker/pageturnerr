Twenty years ago, Hurston's work was largely out-of-print, her literary legacy alive only to a tiny, devoted band of readers who were often forced to photocopy her works if they were to be taught ...

The author of four novels, Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934), Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937),Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939), and Seraph on the Suwanee (1948); two books of folklore -- Mules and Men (1935) and Tell My Horse (1938); an autobiography, Dust Tracks On a Road (1942); and over 50 short stories, essays, and plays, Hurston was one of the most widely acclaimed Black authors for the two decades between 1925 and 1945. -- from the Preface by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/88/9781567430288.jpg', 'title_long': 'Zora neale Hurston: Critical Perspectives Past And Present (Amistad Literary Series)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.15963149812 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15963149812}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 238, 'date_published': '2000-02-11', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Movements & Periods', 'United States', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['Henry L Gates'], 'title': 'Zora neale Hurston: Critical Perspectives Past And Present (Amistad Literary Series)', 'isbn13': '9781567430288', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1567430287', 'isbn10': '1567430287'}}
