{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': 'Once regarded as a brilliant eccentric whose works skirted the outer fringes of English art and literature, William Blake (1757–1827) is today recognized as a major poet, a profound thinker, and one of the most original and exciting English artists. Nowhere is his glorious poetic and pictorial legacy more evident than in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, which many consider his most inspired and original work.<br/>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is both a humorous satire on religion and morality and a work that concisely expresses Blake\'s essential wisdom and philosophy, much of it revealed in the 70 aphorisms of his "Proverbs of Hell." This beautiful edition, reproduced from a rare facsimile, invites readers to enjoy the rich character of Blake\'s own hand-printed text along with his deeply stirring illustrations, reproduced on 27 full-color plates. A typeset transcription of the text is included.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/23/9780486281223.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: A Facsimile in Full Color (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.17 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.17}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}}, 'pages': 48, 'date_published': '1994-09-01', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Individual Artists', "Artists' Books", 'Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Crafts & Hobbies', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Literary', 'Reference'], 'authors': ['William Blake'], 'title': 'The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: A Facsimile in Full Color (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)', 'isbn13': '9780486281223', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '0486132242', 'ePub': '0486132242'}, 'isbn': '0486281221', 'isbn10': '0486281221', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486132242', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
