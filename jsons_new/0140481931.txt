{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Books', 'synopsis': "“one of the most important plays of our time” --Howard Taubman, The New York Times<br/><br/>In Vichy France in 1942, eight men and a boy are seized by the collaborationist authorities and made to wait in a building that may be a police station.

For in this claustrophobic antechamber to the death camps, everyone is guilty. And perhaps none more so than those who can walk away alive.<br/>In Incident at Vichy, Arthur Miller re-creates Dante's hell inside the gaping pit that is our history and populates it with sinners whose crimes are all the more fearful because they are so recognizable.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/38/9780140481938.jpg', 'title_long': 'Incident at Vichy: A Play', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.74 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.14991433816 Pounds, Width: 0.24 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.24}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.14991433816}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.74}}, 'pages': 80, 'date_published': '1985-04-02', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Arthur Miller'], 'title': 'Incident at Vichy: A Play', 'isbn13': '9780140481938', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1101664940'}, 'isbn': '0140481931', 'isbn10': '0140481931', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101664940', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
