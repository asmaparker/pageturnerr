{'book': {'publisher': 'HighBridge Company', 'synopsis': 'Product Description      The Discomfort Zone is Franzen\'s memoir of growth from his boyhood as a "small and fundamentally ridiculous person," through an adolescence both excruciating and strangely happy, into an adult with embarrassing and unexpected passions. It\'s also a portrait of a Midwestern middle-class family weathering the turbulence of the 1970s and a vivid personal history of an America turning its back on a certain idealism.  Daring, honest, and written with the comic scrutiny and unqualified affection that marks Franzen\'s fiction, The Discomfort Zone tells of the formation of one young mind in the crucible of an everyday American family.      About the Author      Jonathan Franzen is the author of numerous books, among them The Twenty-Seventh City, How to Be Alone, and the hugely successful The Corrections, winner of the National Book Award. He lives in New York City.       From AudioFile      Jonathan Franzen is one of those rare authors who read their own work with skill. He may not have quite the panache that a professional audiobook narrator would bring, but his lively and well-paced reading of his memoir is delivered in a pleasant voice that is easy to listen to. When he\'s remembering his complex relationship with his parents, he is fascinated and mystified; when he considers the state of the country, he\'s furious; and when he\'s recalling his early pursuit of sex, he is painfully funny. Through it all, he is articulate. Franzen says that in real life he\'s a "bit of a mumbler." Can\'t tell it from this excellent production.
