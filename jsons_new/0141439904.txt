{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': 'In these two chilling stories, Henry James shows himself to be a master of haunting atmosphere and unbearable tension. The Turn of the Screw tells of a young governess sent to a country home to take charge of two orphans, Miles and Flora. Unsettled by a sense of intense evil within the house, she soon becomes obsessed with the belief that malevolent forces are stalking the children in her care. Obsession of a more worldly variety lies at the heart of The Aspern Papers, the tale of a literary historian determined to get his hands on some letters written by a great poet-and prepared to use trickery and deception to achieve his aims.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/07/9780141439907.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Turn of the Screw and the Aspern Papers (Penguin Classics)', 'edition': 'New Ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.8 Inches, Length: 5.1 Inches, Weight: 0.44533376924 pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.44533376924}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.8}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2003-09-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Henry James'], 'title': 'The Turn of the Screw and the Aspern Papers (Penguin Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780141439907', 'msrp': 6.3, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0141439904', 'isbn10': '0141439904'}}
