Set in a small town in the middle of the deep South, it is the story of John Singer, a lonely deaf-mute, and a disparate group of people who are drawn towards his kind, sympathetic nature. The owner of the caf√© where Singer eats every day, a young girl desperate to grow up, an angry socialist drunkard, a frustrated black doctor: each pours their heart out to Singer, their silent confidant, and he in turn changes their disenchanted lives in ways the could never imagine. Moving, sensitive and deeply humane, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter explores loneliness, the human need for understanding and the search for love.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/52/24/9780141185224.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter', 'edition': 'New Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 0.79921259761 Inches, Length: 8.5039369992 Inches, Weight: 0.551155655 Pounds, Width: 5.4330708606 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5039369992}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.4330708606}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.551155655}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.79921259761}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2000-08-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics'], 'authors': ['Carso Mccullers'], 'title': 'The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter', 'isbn13': '9780141185224', 'msrp': 16.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0141185228', 'isbn10': '0141185228'}}
