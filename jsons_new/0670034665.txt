{'book': {'publisher': 'Viking', 'synopsis': 'A journalist\x92s provocative and spellbinding account of her eighteen months spent disguised as a man<br/>Norah Vincent became an instant media sensation with the publication of Self-Made Man, her take on just how hard it is to be a man, even in a man\x92s world. Following in the tradition of John Howard Griffin (Black Like Me), Norah spent a year and a half disguised as her male alter ego, Ned, exploring what men are like when women aren\x92t around. As Ned, she joins a bowling team, takes a high-octane sales job, goes on dates with women (and men), visits strip clubs, and even manages to infiltrate a monastery and a men\x92s therapy group. At once thought- provoking and pure fun to read, Self-Made Man is a sympathetic and thrilling tour de force of immersion journalism.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/66/9780670034666.jpg', 'title_long': "Self-Made Man: One Woman's Journey into Manhood and Back Again", 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.1 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 304, 'date_published': '2006-01-19', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Gender Studies', 'Popular Culture'], 'authors': ['Norah Vincent'], 'title': "Self-Made Man: One Woman's Journey into Manhood and Back Again", 'isbn13': '9780670034666', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1101201347', 'ePub': '1101201347'}, 'isbn': '0670034665', 'isbn10': '0670034665', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101201343', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
