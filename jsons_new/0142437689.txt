{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Classics', 'synopsis': "A comprehensive collection of Whitman's most beloved works of poetry, prose, and short stories<br/><br/>When Walt Whitman self-published Leaves of Grass in 1855 it was a slim volume of twelve poems and he was a journalist and poet from Long Island, little-known but full of ambition and poetic fire. To give a new voice to the new nation shaken by civil war, he spent his entire life revising and adding to the work, but his initial act of bravado in answering Ralph Waldo Emerson's call for a national poet has made Whitman the quintessential American writer. This rich cross-section of his work includes poems from throughout Whitman's lifetime as published on his deathbed edition of 1891, short stories, his prefaces to the many editions of Leaves of Grass, and a variety of prose selections, including Democratic Vistas, Specimen Days, and Slang in America.<br/><br/>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/81/9780142437681.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Portable Walt Whitman (Penguin Classics)', 'edition': 'Revised ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.7 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 1.0251495183 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.0251495183}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.7}}, 'pages': 608, 'date_published': '2003-12-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'History & Criticism', 'Criticism & Theory', 'Genres & Styles', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Poetry', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Walt Whitman'], 'title': 'The Portable Walt Whitman (Penguin Classics)', 'isbn13': '9780142437681', 'msrp': 17.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1440650977'}, 'isbn': '0142437689', 'isbn10': '0142437689', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781440650970', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
