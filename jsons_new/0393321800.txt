{'book': {'publisher': 'W. W. Norton & Company', 'synopsis': '"Shattuck leaves us not only with a deepened appreciation of Proust\'s great work but of all great literature as well."â€•Richard Bernstein, New York Times For any reader who has been humbled by the language, the density, or the sheer weight of Marcel Proust\'s In Search of Lost Time, Roger Shattuck is a godsend. Winner of the National Book Award for Marcel Proust, a sweeping examination of Proust\'s life and works, Shattuck now offers a useful and eminently readable guidebook to Proust\'s epic masterpiece, and a contemplation of memory and consciousness throughout great literature. Here, Shattuck laments Proust\'s defenselessness against zealous editors, praises some translations, and presents Proust as a novelist whose philosophical gifts were matched only by his irrepressible comic sense. Proust\'s Way, the culmination of a lifetime of scholarship, will serve as the next generation\'s guide to one of the world\'s finest writers of fiction.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/07/9780393321807.jpg', 'title_long': "Proust's Way: A Field Guide to", 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.6 Inches, Weight: 0.62 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.62}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2}}, 'pages': 318, 'date_published': '2001-08-17', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'History & Criticism', 'Regional & Cultural', 'World Literature', 'European'], 'authors': ['Roger Shattuck'], 'title': "Proust's Way: A Field Guide to", 'isbn13': '9780393321807', 'msrp': 12.54, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0393078701'}, 'isbn': '0393321800', 'isbn10': '0393321800', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780393078701', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
