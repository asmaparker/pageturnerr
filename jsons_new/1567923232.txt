{'book': {'publisher': 'David R. Godine, Publisher', 'synopsis': 'Perfect for kids who love to laugh, a classic tale about the value of fooling around, written and illustrated by two masters of children’s literature.<br/><br/>Tom loves to fool around and is very good at it. So he invents a jam-powered frog and takes his Aunt Bundlejoy Cosysweet out on the frog out for a spin. When the no-nonsense Captain Najork sees them hopping past his window, he and his hired sportsmen jump into their pedal-powered snake and set off in hot pursuit.<br/><br/>Events, adventure and sheer craziness conspire to bring Tom and the Captain together at the local girls’ boarding school, where Aunt Fidget Wonkham-Strong Najork is in the middle of a best-of-three arm-wrestling contest against the Headmistress…<br/><br/>Sublimely silly, this is a very funny collaboration for children by Russell Hoban and Quentin Blake, a rip-roaring adventure guaranteed to keep the pages turning and the laughs bouncing off the ceiling! This is a brilliant companion volume to How Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen, also published by Godine.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/30/9781567923230.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Near Thing for Captain Najork', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.6 Inches, Length: 6.4 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 0.12 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.4}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.12}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.2}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.6}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '2006-10-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Russell Hoban'], 'title': 'A Near Thing for Captain Najork', 'isbn13': '9781567923230', 'msrp': 7.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1567923232', 'isbn10': '1567923232'}}
