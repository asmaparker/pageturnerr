{'book': {'publisher': 'Dover Publications', 'synopsis': "The stirring tale of a legendary royal family's fall and ultimate redemption, the Theban trilogy endures as the crowning achievement of Greek drama. Sophocles' three-play cycle, chronicling Oedipus's search for the truth and its tragic results, remains essential reading for English and classical studies majors as well as for all students of Western civilization.<br/>Oedipus Rex unfolds amid a city in the relentless grip of a plague. When an oracle proclaims that only an act of vengeance will lift the curse from Thebes, King Oedipus vows to bring a murderer to justice. His quest engenders a series of keen dramatic ironies, culminating in the fulfillment of a dreaded prophecy. Oedipus at Colonus finds the former ruler in exile. Old and blind, he seeks a peaceful place to end his torment, but finds only challenges from his reluctant hosts and a summons back to Thebes from his warring sons. The trilogy concludes with Antigone, in which Oedipus's courageous daughter defies her tyrannical uncle in a provocative exploration of the demands of loyalty and duty.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/90/9780486450490.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Theban Plays: Oedipus Rex, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.9 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.29982867632 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.29982867632}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.9}}, 'pages': 176, 'date_published': '2006-06-23', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Ancient & Classical', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Sophocles'], 'title': 'The Theban Plays: Oedipus Rex, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone (Dover Thrift Editions: Plays)', 'isbn13': '9780486450490', 'msrp': 5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '048611497X'}, 'isbn': '048645049X', 'isbn10': '048645049X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486114972', 'binding': 'fpid13alias'}]}}
