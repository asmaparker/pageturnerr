From later 1931 to the end of 1932, Nin falls in love with Henry Miller's writing and his wife June's striking beauty. When June leaves Paris for New York, Henry and Anaïs begin a fiery affair that liberates her sexually and morally, but also undermines her marriage and eventually leads to her psychoanalysis. As she grapples with her own conscience, a single question dominates her thoughts: What will happen when June returns to Paris? An intimate story of one woman's sexual awakening, Henry and June exposes the pain and pleasure of a single person trapped between two loves.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/72/9780156400572.jpg', 'title_long': 'Henry and June: From "A Journal of Love" -The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin (1931-1932)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.64 Pounds, Width: 0.696 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.696}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.64}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 281, 'date_published': '1990-10-29', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Anais Nin'], 'title': 'Henry and June: From "A Journal of Love" -The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin (1931-1932)', 'isbn13': '9780156400572', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '015640057X', 'isbn10': '015640057X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547540238', 'binding': 'saleableprint'}]}}
