{'book': {'publisher': 'Westminster John Knox Press', 'synopsis': 'Renowned British music journalist and author Steve Turner surveys the religious and spiritual influence of the Beatles, the band that changed the history of music forever. With new interviews, never-before-published material, and fresh insights, Turner helps the reader understand the religious and spiritual ideas and ideals that influenced the music and lives of the Beatles and helps us see how the Fab Four influenced our own lives and culture.<br/>Topics discussed include the religious upbringing of John, Paul, George, and Ringo; the backlash in the United States after John Lennon\'s "The Beatles are more popular than Jesus" comment; the dabbling in Eastern religion; the use of drugs to attempt to enter a higher level of consciousness; and the overall legacy that the Beatles and their music have left. While there is no religious system that permanently anchored the Beatles or their music, they did leave a gospel, Turner concludes: one of love, peace, personal freedom, and the search for transcendence.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/32/9780664229832.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Gospel According to the Beatles', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 280, 'date_published': '2006-08-01', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Personal Growth', 'Theology', 'Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'History & Criticism', 'Musical Genres', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Pop Culture', 'Beatles', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Religious Studies', 'Philosophy'], 'authors': ['Steve Turner'], 'title': 'The Gospel According to the Beatles', 'isbn13': '9780664229832', 'msrp': 22, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0664229832', 'isbn10': '0664229832'}}
