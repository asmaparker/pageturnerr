Nevertheless, Poppy, with her beautiful orange-brown fur, dark round eyes and pink toes is forced to become braver than any other mouse. She and her family live in an old house on the edge of the sprawling, sinister Dimwood Forest. They are ruled over by Mr Ocax, a great horned owl who dwells in Dimwood.
