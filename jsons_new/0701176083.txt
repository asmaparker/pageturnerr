{'book': {'publisher': 'Chatto & Windus', 'synopsis': 'A one-volume narrative history of the Mediterranean from Ancient Egypt to 1919. Written in the racy, readable prose for which the author is famous, this is colourful, character-driven history at its most enjoyable.<br/><br/>This magnificent undertaking tackles a vast subject — vast in time (from the oldest surviving pyramid to the First World War); vast in geography (from Gibraltar to Jerusalem); and vast in culture, including as it does the civilizations of the Phoenicians, the Ancient Egyptians, Greece, Carthage, Rome, Byzantium, as well as the Borgias and the Medicis, Mohammed and El Cid, Napoleon and Nelson, Moslems, Jews and Christians.<br/><br/>The Middle Sea is not a dry record of facts; it is a rackety read about historical figures — dissolute Popes and wily Emperors, noble-hearted Generals and beautiful Princesses. But his greatest strength is naval and military history: from the Crusades to the expulsion of the Moors from Spain; from Trafalgar to Gallipoli. Towns are besieged and sacked, Kingdoms are won and lost. The narrative covers the glories of Constantinople and Venice, and the stirring history of the islands of the Mediterranean — Malta, Sicily, Crete and Cyprus.<br/><br/>The Middle Sea is the culmination of John Julius Norwich’s long and distinguished career as one of the greatest enthusiasts for anecdotal history, and the highways and byways of scholarship.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/60/82/9780701176082.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Middle Sea', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 2.25753356288 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.25753356288}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 364, 'date_published': '2006-10-31', 'subjects': ['History', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['John Julius Norwich'], 'title': 'The Middle Sea', 'isbn13': '9780701176082', 'msrp': 39.65, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0701176083', 'isbn10': '0701176083'}}
