The townspeople of Frip make their living raising goats, but they must fight off a daily invasion of gappers, bright orange, many-eyed creatures that cover goats and stop them from giving milk. When the gappers target Capable's goats, the Romos and the Ronsens turn their backs on the gapper-ridden Capable. What will Capable do about her gapper plague? An imaginative tale by acclaimed author George Saunders accented with haunting illustrations by award-winning illustrator Lane Smith, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is an adult story for children, a children's story for adults, an oceanside fable for the landlocked, a fish story for loaves, and a fable about the true meaning of community.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/74/9781932416374.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.80027801106 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.80027801106}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 84, 'date_published': '2006-04-09', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Fairy Tales, Folk Tales & Myths', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World'], 'authors': ['George Saunders'], 'title': 'The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip', 'isbn13': '9781932416374', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1932416374', 'isbn10': '1932416374'}}
