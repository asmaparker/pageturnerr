{'book': {'publisher': 'Gallery Books', 'synopsis': 'In the forty-year history of Star TrekÂ®, none of the television show\'s actors are more beloved than DeForest Kelley. His portrayal of Leonard "Bones" McCoy, the southern physician aboard the Starship Enterprise\x99, brought an unaffected humanity to the groundbreaking space frontier series.<br/>Jackson DeForest Kelley came of age in Depression-era Georgia. He was raised on the sawdust trail, a preacher\'s kid steeped in his father\'s literal faith and judgment. But De\'s natural artistic gifts called him to a different way, and a visit to California at seventeen showed a bright new world.<br/>Theater and radio defined his early career -- but it was a World War II training film he made while serving in the Army Air Corps that led to his first Paramount Studios contract.<br/>After years of struggle, his lean, weathered look became well known in notable westerns and television programs such as You Are There and Bonanza. But his work on several pilots for writer-producer Gene Roddenberry changed his destiny and the course of cultural history.<br/>This thoroughly researched actor\'s life is about hard work and luck, loyalty and love. It is a journey that takes us all...from sawdust to stardust.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/76/20/9780743457620.jpg', 'title_long': "From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley, Star Trek's Dr. McCoy", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.93475999088 Pounds, Width: 0.98 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.98}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.93475999088}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 362, 'date_published': '2005-02-01', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Military', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Space Opera', 'Alien Invasion', 'Genetic Engineering', 'First Contact', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Terry Lee Rioux'], 'title': "From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley, Star Trek's Dr. McCoy", 'isbn13': '9780743457620', 'msrp': 23.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0743457625', 'isbn10': '0743457625', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416500049', 'binding': 'ebook'}]}}
