{'book': {'publisher': 'Delta', 'synopsis': "When she was about to turn five, a little girl named Rae Hansen invited Richard Bach to her birthday party. Though deserts, storms, mountains, and a thousand miles separated them, Rae was confident that her friend would appear. There's No Such Place As Far Away chronicles the exhilarating spiritual journey that delivered Rae's anxiously awaited guest to her side on that special day--and tells of the powerful and enduring gift that would keep him forever close to her heart.<br/><br/>Written with the same elegant simplicity that made Jonathan Livingston Seagull a bestselling phenomenon, There's No Such Place As Far Away has touched the hearts of thousands of readers since its first publication in 1979. Richard Bach's inspiring, now-classic tale is a profound reminder that miles cannot truly separate us from friends...that those we love are always with us--every moment of the infinite celebration we call life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/92/70/9780385319270.jpg', 'title_long': "There's No Such Place as Far Away", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.25 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 48, 'date_published': '1998-01-12', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Richard Bach'], 'title': "There's No Such Place as Far Away", 'isbn13': '9780385319270', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0385319274', 'isbn10': '0385319274'}}
