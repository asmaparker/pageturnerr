{'book': {'publisher': 'Vision', 'synopsis': "Narcotics officer Cal Moore's orders were to look into the city's latest drug killing. Instead, he ends up in a motel room with a fatal bullet wound to the head and a suicide note stuffed in his back pocket. Working the case, LAPD detective Harry Bosch is reminded of the primal police rule he learned long ago: Don't look for the facts, but the glue that holds them together. Soon Harry's making some very dangerous connections, starting with a dead cop and leading to a bloody string of murders that wind from Hollywood Boulevard to the back alleys south of the border. Now this battle-scarred veteran will find himself in the center of a complex and deadly game-one in which he may be the next and likeliest victim.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/46/9780446613446.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Black Ice (Harry Bosch)', 'edition': '~', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.25 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 439, 'date_published': '2003-12-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Police Procedurals', 'Hard-Boiled', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Michael Connelly'], 'title': 'The Black Ice (Harry Bosch)', 'isbn13': '9780446613446', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0446613444', 'isbn10': '0446613444'}}
