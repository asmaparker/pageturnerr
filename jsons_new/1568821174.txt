{'book': {'publisher': 'Chaosium', 'synopsis': "Like any eclectic catalog of dark music, this volume of stories explores many levels of emotion, each writer composing his own unique movement to the symphony. Here, you will find a wide range of voices, some spinning tales of pure, deep dread, much as might be found in the most successful works of HPL himself. Others venture into territory that the Old Gent would never have imagined, or wanted to imagine . . . There's even a touch of whimsy to be found, yet always mingled with the strain of darkness like that faced by Erich Zann in his gatrret in the rue d'Auseil.<br/>This book is part of an expanding collection of Cthulhu Mythos horror fiction and related topics. Call of Cthulhu fiction focuses on single entities, concepts, or authors significant to readers and fans of H.P. Lovecraft.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/11/77/9781568821177.jpg', 'title_long': 'Song of Cthulhu: Tales of Spheres Beyond Sound', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.6283174467 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6283174467}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 200, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'Song of Cthulhu: Tales of Spheres Beyond Sound', 'isbn13': '9781568821177', 'msrp': 16.22, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1568821174', 'isbn10': '1568821174'}}
