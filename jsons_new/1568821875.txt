{'book': {'publisher': 'Chaosium', 'synopsis': "In all of North Am-er-ica there is no more perfect in-ter-section of climate, cul-ture, and colorful history than San\u2008Fran--cisco - the culmination of Manifest Destiny, the Golden\u2008Gate to the Pacific Ocean, and the treasure house of the wealth of the great California Gold Rush. Purged of her wild, anarchic past by a devastating earthquake and fire at the beginning of the twentieth century, San Francisco has emerged as the most cosmopolitan city on the West Coast. San Francisco is deceptively ancient; its history shroud-ed in a fog of false domesticity. The Bay Area has known many masters, each leaving a distinctive mark upon the land. As San Francisco blossoms it attracts fugitives and practitioners of unorthodox faiths from across the world. Tales of the region assume mythic proportions as it be-comes the most ethnically diverse, and most lawless, place in America. SECRETS\u2008OF\u2008SAN\u2008FRANCISCO provides excellent background for a CALL\u2008OF\u2008CTHULHU campaign set in the Bay Area of the 1920s. It includes urban geography, civic history and research venues, and mythos lore. Many period photographs are provided and dozens of historical figures are introduced, including several who collaborated and corresponded with Lovecraft. Here are provided descriptions of where San\u2008Franciscan's are sent when they break the law, go insane, or pass-beyond. Here are the sights, sounds, and secrets of this place that makes it a unique city.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/70/9781568821870.jpg', 'title_long': 'Secrets of San Francisco: A 1920s Sourcebook for the City By the Bay (Call of Cthulhu Horror Roleplaying)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11 Inches, Length: 8.5 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 0.41 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.41}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11}}, 'pages': 189, 'date_published': '2006-04-30', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Gaming', 'Call of Cthulhu'], 'authors': ['Cody Goodfellow', 'David Conyers', 'Brian M.
