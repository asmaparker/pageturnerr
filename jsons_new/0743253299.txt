{'book': {'publisher': 'Scribner', 'synopsis': 'From critically acclaimed journalist Valerie Boyd comes an eloquent profile of one of the most intriguing cultural figures of the twentieth century—Zora Neale Hurston.<br/><br/>A woman of enormous talent and remarkable drive, Zora Neale Hurston published seven books, many short stories, and several articles and plays over a career that spanned more than thirty years. Today, nearly every black woman writer of significance—including Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker—acknowledges Hurston as a literary foremother, and her 1937 masterpiece Their Eyes Were Watching God has become a crucial part of the modern literary canon.<br/><br/>Wrapped in Rainbows, the first biography of Zora Neale Hurston in more than twenty-five years, illuminates the adventures, complexities, and sorrows of an extraordinary life. Acclaimed journalist Valerie Boyd delves into Hurston’s history—her youth in the country’s first incorporated all-black town, her friendships with luminaries such as Langston Hughes, her sexuality and short-lived marriages, and her mysterious relationship with vodou. With the Harlem Renaissance, the Great Depression, and World War II as historical backdrops, Wrapped in Rainbows not only positions Hurston’s work in her time but also offers riveting implications for our own.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/32/91/9780743253291.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.3 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 544, 'date_published': '2004-02-03', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Black & African American', 'Women', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Valerie Boyd'], 'title': 'Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston', 'isbn13': '9780743253291', 'msrp': 20, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1439125414', 'ePub': '1439125414'}, 'isbn': '0743253299', 'isbn10': '0743253299', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781439125410', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
