The knot that ties these together is the truth that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him. Jesus Christ died and rose again to forgive the treason of our souls, which have turned from savoring God to savoring self. In the cross of Christ, God rescues us from the house of mirrors and leads us out to the mountains and canyons of His majesty. Nothing satisfies us—or magnifies Him—more.”<br/>—John Piper', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/59/9781590526859.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Blazing Center Study Guide: The Soul-Satisfying Supremacy of God in All Things', 'edition': 'Study Guide', 'dimensions': 'height: 215 mm, length: 150 mm, width: 7 mm, weight: 125 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 150}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 125}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 215}}, 'pages': 112, 'date_published': '2006-07-03', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Theology', 'Ministry & Evangelism', 'Adult Ministry', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Worship & Devotion', 'Devotionals', 'Christian Living', 'Spiritual Growth', 'Self Help'], 'authors': ['Desiring God'], 'title': 'The Blazing Center Study Guide: The Soul-Satisfying Supremacy of God in All Things', 'isbn13': '9781590526859', 'msrp': 9.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1590526856', 'isbn10': '1590526856'}}
