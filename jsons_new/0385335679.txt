{'book': {'publisher': 'Dial Press Trade Paperback', 'synopsis': 'Hilarious, sexy, and deeply tender, Kissing in Manhattan was one of the most celebrated debuts in recent years. Acclaimed author David Schickler’s collection of linked stories follows a troupe of love-hungry urbanites through a charmed metropolis and into the Preemption--a mythic Manhattan apartment building. The Preemption sets the stage for a romantic fantasy as exuberant, dark, and dazzling as the city it occupies. Behind closed doors, the paths of an improbable cast of tenants--a seductive perfume heiress; a crabby, misunderstood actor; a preternaturally sharp-sighted priest--tangle and cross, while a perilous love triangle builds around three characters:<br/><br/>James Branch, a shy young accountant with an unusual love for the Preemption’s antique elevator, and a strange destiny...<br/><br/>Patrick Rigg, a Wall Street lothario who soothes his pain by seducing<br/>beautiful women, carrying a gun, and attending the nightly sermons of a foreboding priest...<br/><br/>Rally McWilliams, a fetching, hopeful young writer who roams the city at night, searching for the soulmate she believes in but can’t find...<br/><br/>Charged with joy and a deadly sense of humor, Kissing in Manhattan is a daring new writer’s vision of a world where men and women, good and evil, love and sex, meet, battle, and embrace on every street corner.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/56/76/9780385335676.jpg', 'title_long': 'Kissing in Manhattan: Stories', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.53 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.53}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.3}}, 'pages': 274, 'date_published': '2002-08-27', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['David Schickler'], 'title': 'Kissing in Manhattan: Stories', 'isbn13': '9780385335676', 'msrp': 11.66, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0385335679', 'isbn10': '0385335679'}}
