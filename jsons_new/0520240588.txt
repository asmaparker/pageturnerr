{'book': {'publisher': 'University of California Press', 'synopsis': "This biography of composer Hector Berlioz (1803-1869) describes with unprecedented intimacy, affection, and respect the life of one of France's greatest artists. After long being regarded as an oddity and an eccentric figure, Berlioz is now being accepted into the ranks of the great composers. Based on a wealth of previously unpublished sources, and on a profound understanding of the humanity of his subject, David Cairns's book provides a full account of this extraordinary and powerfully attractive man.<br/><br/>Volume II follows Berlioz's life from 1832 to his death in 1869, his most active years as a composer, conductor, and critic. This volume provides telling portraits of those close to Berlioz: his two wives, his son and his sisters, his friends and colleagues, fellow composers and critics. Cairns vividly evokes Berlioz's music and the music-making world of nineteenth-century Paris. Volume II also includes chapters on Wagner, Berlioz's career as a critic, the composer's concert tours in Germany, Russia, and England, and much more.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/05/82/9780520240582.jpg', 'title_long': 'Berlioz: Volume Two: Servitude and Greatness, 1832-1869', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 3.25 Pounds, Width: 2.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 2.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 3.25}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 907, 'date_published': '2003-10-01', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Music', 'History & Criticism', 'Musical Genres', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Actors & Entertainers', 'Composers & Musicians'], 'authors': ['David Cairns'], 'title': 'Berlioz: Volume Two: Servitude and Greatness, 1832-1869', 'isbn13': '9780520240582', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0520240588', 'isbn10': '0520240588'}}
