{'book': {'publisher': 'NYRB Classics', 'synopsis': "Norman Moonbloom is a loser, a drop-out who can't even make it as a deadbeat. His brother, a slumlord, hires him to collect rent in the buildings he owns in Manhattan. Making his rounds from apartment to apartment, Moonbloom confronts a wildly varied assortment of brilliantly described urban characters, among them a gay jazz musician with a sideline as a gigolo, a Holocaust survivor, and a brilliant young black writer modeled on James Baldwin. Moonbloom hears their cries of outrage and abuse; he learns about their secret sorrows and desires. And as he grows familiar with their stories, he finds that he is drawn, in spite of his best judgment, into a desperate attempt to improve their lives.<br/><br/>Edward Lewis Wallant's astonishing comic tour de force is a neglected masterpiece of 1960s America.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/00/9781590170700.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Tenants of Moonbloom (New York Review Books Classics)', 'edition': 'Revised ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.1 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.6283174467 Pounds, Width: 0.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6283174467}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.1}}, 'pages': 264, 'date_published': '2003-11-30', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Lawyers & Criminals', 'Self-Help & Psychology', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Comedy', 'Genre Fiction', 'Urban Life', 'Family Life', 'United States', 'Humor & Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Edward Lewis Wallant'], 'title': 'The Tenants of Moonbloom (New York Review Books Classics)', 'isbn13': '9781590170700', 'msrp': 17.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1681373041'}, 'isbn': '1590170709', 'isbn10': '1590170709', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781681373041', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
