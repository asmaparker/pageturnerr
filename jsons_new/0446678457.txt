They are women whose lives begin in slavery, who weather the Civil War, and who grapple with contradictions of emancipation, Jim Crow, and the pre-Civil Rights South. As she peels back layers of racial and cultural attitudes, Tademy paints a remarkable picture of rural Louisiana and the resilient spirit of one unforgettable family.<br/><br/>There is Elisabeth, who bears both a proud legacy and the yoke of bondage... her youngest daughter, Suzette, who is the first to discover the promise-and heartbreak-of freedom... Suzette's strong-willed daughter Philomene, who uses a determination born of tragedy to reunite her family and gain unheard-of economic independence... and Emily, Philomene's spirited daughter, who fights to secure her children's just due and preserve their dignity and future.<br/><br/>Meticulously researched and beautifully written, Cane River presents a slice of American history never before seen in such piercing and personal detail.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/52/9780446678452.jpg', 'title_long': "Cane River (Oprah's Book Club)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.1 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 1.02 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.02}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.1}}, 'pages': 560, 'date_published': '2002-04-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'United States', 'Black & African American', 'Contemporary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lalita Tademy'], 'title': "Cane River (Oprah's Book Club)", 'isbn13': '9780446678452', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Hardcover': '0759522421', 'ePub': '0759522421'}, 'isbn': '0446678457', 'isbn10': '0446678457', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780759522428', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
