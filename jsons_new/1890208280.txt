{'book': {'publisher': 'Poisoned Pen Press', 'synopsis': 'Gillian Adams first appeared in In the Shadow of King\'s, a novel that garnered reviews like ""Almost unbelievably, the university-bound detective story with all the wit and panache of Innes, Crispin, and Amanda Cross in their heyday, is Kelly\'s first novel"" [Toronto Globe and Mail]. Now the Vancouver author returns Gillian to her faculty post as head of the History Department at the University of the Pacific Northwest where sexism has reared its ugly head in attacks on the Feminist (""Eff Yours"") Union. Though separated from her lover Edward, a Scotland Yard man, Gillian hasn\'t lost her sleuthing skills. While others see the nasty acts as student pranks, she finds a larger pattern of discrimination developing which leads to a prize-student--and radical feminist--losing a valuable fellowship she was expected to win. But worse is to come: Rita is murdered. Gillian\'s dilemma becomes whether to look for a personal, or a professional, motive....<br/>Adroitly plotted, filled with intrigue and intriguing characters, My Sister\'s Keeper solves the crimes but leaves the mystery of Gillian, poised between her career in Vancouver and her romance in England, not to mention worry about her mother in upstate New York, open.<br/>We publish Bad Chemistry in August, Gillian\'s third case. Her fourth, Old Wounds, won the 1999 Arthur Ellis Best Novel Award and has elicited rave reviews upon our December 1999 release.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/88/9781890208288.jpg', 'title_long': "My Sister's Keeper (Missing Mysteries)", 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Weight: 0.65256829552 Pounds, Width: 0.58 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.58}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65256829552}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 228, 'date_published': '2000-02-01', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths'], 'authors': ['Nora Kelly'], 'title': "My Sister's Keeper (Missing Mysteries)", 'isbn13': '9781890208288', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1890208280', 'isbn10': '1890208280'}}
