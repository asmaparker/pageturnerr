{'book': {'publisher': 'Knopf', 'synopsis': 'An unprecedented account of life in Baghdad’s Green Zone, a walled-off enclave of towering plants, posh villas, and sparkling swimming pools that was the headquarters for the American occupation of Iraq.<br/><br/>The Washington Post’s former Baghdad bureau chief Rajiv Chandrasekaran takes us with him into the Zone: into a bubble, cut off from wartime realities, where the task of reconstructing a devastated nation competed with the distractions of a Little America—a half-dozen bars stocked with cold beer, a disco where women showed up in hot pants, a movie theater that screened shoot-’em-up films, an all-you-could-eat buffet piled high with pork, a shopping mall that sold pornographic movies, a parking lot filled with shiny new SUVs, and a snappy dry-cleaning service—much of it run by Halliburton. Most Iraqis were barred from entering the Emerald City for fear they would blow it up.<br/><br/>Drawing on hundreds of interviews and internal documents, Chandrasekaran tells the story of the people and ideas that inhabited the Green Zone during the occupation, from the imperial viceroy L. Paul Bremer III to the fleet of twentysomethings hired to implement the idea that Americans could build a Jeffersonian democracy in an embattled Middle Eastern country.<br/><br/>In the vacuum of postwar planning, Bremer ignores what Iraqis tell him they want or need and instead pursues irrelevant neoconservative solutions—a flat tax, a sell-off of Iraqi government assets, and an end to food rationing. His underlings spend their days drawing up pie-in-the-sky policies, among them a new traffic code and a law protecting microchip designs, instead of rebuilding looted buildings and restoring electricity production. His almost comic initiatives anger the locals and help fuel the insurgency.<br/><br/>Chandrasekaran details Bernard Kerik’s ludicrous attempt to train the Iraqi police and brings to light lesser known but typical travesties: the case of the twenty-four-year-old who had never worked in finance put in charge of reestablishing Baghdad’s stock exchange; a contractor with no previous experience paid millions to guard a closed airport; a State Department employee forced to bribe Americans to enlist their help in preventing Iraqi weapons scientists from defecting to Iran; Americans willing to serve in Iraq screened by White House officials for their views on Roe v. Wade; peoplewith prior expertise in the Middle East excluded in favor of lesser-qualified Republican Party loyalists. Finally, he describes Bremer’s ignominious departure in 2004, fleeing secretly in a helicopter two days ahead of schedule.<br/><br/>This is a startling portrait of an Oz-like place where a vital aspect of our government’s folly in Iraq played out. It is a book certain to be talked about for years to come.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/48/70/9781400044870.jpg', 'title_long': "Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.35 Pounds, Width: 1.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.35}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2006-09-19', 'subjects': ['History', 'Middle East', 'Iraq', 'Military', 'United States', 'Iraq War', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics'], 'authors': ['Rajiv Chandrasekaran'], 'title': "Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone", 'isbn13': '9781400044870', 'msrp': 25.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '0307265927'}, 'isbn': '1400044871', 'isbn10': '1400044871', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307265920', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
