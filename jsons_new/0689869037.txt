{'book': {'publisher': 'Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers', 'synopsis': "You could say that my railroad, the Madham Line, is almost the most important thing in my life. Next to Andy Morrow, my best friend.<br/><br/>Lots of people think Doug Hanson is a freak -- he gets beat up after school, and the girl of his dreams calls him a worm. Doug's only refuge is creating an elaborate bridge for the model railroad in his basement and hanging out with his best friend, Andy Morrow, a popular football star who could date any girl in school. Doug and Andy talk about everything -- except what happened at the Tuttle place a few years back.<br/><br/>It does not matter to Andy that we live in completely different realities. I'm Andy's best friend. It does not matter to Andy that we hardly ever actually do anything together.<br/><br/>As Doug retreats deeper and deeper into his own reality, long-buried secrets threaten to destroy both Doug and Andy -- and everything else in Doug's fragile world.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/37/9780689869037.jpg', 'title_long': 'Invisible', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.32 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.32}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 149, 'date_published': '2006-11-28', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Loners & Outcasts'], 'authors': ['Pete Hautman'], 'title': 'Invisible', 'isbn13': '9780689869037', 'msrp': 16.14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1439107041', 'ePub': '1439107041'}, 'isbn': '0689869037', 'isbn10': '0689869037', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781439107041', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
