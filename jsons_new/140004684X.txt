{'book': {'publisher': 'Crown', 'synopsis': 'In his explosive New York Times bestseller, top CIA operative Robert Baer paints a chilling picture of how terrorism works on the inside and provides startling evidence of how Washington politics sabotaged the CIA’s efforts to root out the world’s deadliest terrorists, allowing for the rise of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda and the continued entrenchment of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.<br/><br/>A veteran case officer in the CIA’s Directorate of Operations in the Middle East, Baer witnessed the rise of terrorism first hand and the CIA’s inadequate response to it, leading to the attacks of September 11, 2001. This riveting book is both an indictment of an agency that lost its way and an unprecedented look at the roots of modern terrorism, and includes a new afterword in which Baer speaks out about the American war on terrorism and its profound implications throughout the Middle East.<br/><br/>“Robert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field<br/>officer in the Middle East.”<br/>–Seymour M. Hersh, The New Yorker<br/><br/>From The Preface<br/>This book is a memoir of one foot soldier’s career in the other cold war, the one against terrorist networks. It’s a story about places most Americans will never travel to, about people many Americans would prefer to think we don’t need to do business with.<br/><br/>This memoir, I hope, will show the reader how spying is supposed to work, where the CIA lost its way, and how we can bring it back again. But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well: I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA. And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed, too.<br/><br/>The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness, by petty Beltway wars, by careerism, and much more. At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally, the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead. Americans were making too much money to bother. Life was good. The White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad. Defanged and dispirited, the CIA went along for the ride. And then on September 11, 2001, the reckoning for such vast carelessness was presented for all the world to see.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/43/9781400046843.jpg', 'title_long': "See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.21 Inches, Length: 6.1 Inches, Weight: 0.88846291586 Pounds, Width: 0.87 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.87}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.88846291586}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.21}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2003-01-07', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Military', 'Political', 'Memoirs', 'Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Specific Topics', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Robert Baer'], 'title': "See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism", 'isbn13': '9781400046843', 'msrp': 11.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '140004684X', 'isbn10': '140004684X'}}
