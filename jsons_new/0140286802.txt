{'book': {'publisher': 'PENGUIN BOOKS LTD. USA', 'synopsis': 'For the first time in English, all the fiction by the writer who has been called “the greatest Spanish-language writer of our century” collected in a single volume<br/><br/>“An event, and cause for celebration.”—The New York Times<br/><br/>A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition with flaps and deckle-edged paper<br/><br/>For some fifty years, in intriguing and ingenious fictions that reimagined the very form of the short story—from his 1935 debut with A Universal History of Iniquity through his immensely influential collections Ficciones and The Aleph, the enigmatic prose poems of The Maker, up to his final work in the 1980s, Shakespeare’s Memory—Jorge Luis Borges returned again and again to his celebrated themes: dreams, duels, labyrinths, mirrors, infinite libraries, the manipulations of chance, gauchos, knife fighters, tigers, and the elusive nature of identity itself. Playfully experimenting with ostensibly subliterary genres, he took the detective story and turned it into metaphysics; he took fantasy writing and made it, with its questioning and reinventing of everyday reality, central to the craft of fiction; he took the literary essay and put it to use reviewing wholly imaginary books.<br/><br/>Bringing together for the first time in English all of Borges’s magical stories, and all of them newly rendered into English in brilliant translations by Andrew Hurley, Collected Fictions is the perfect one-volume compendium for all who have long loved Borges, and a superb introduction to the master’s work for all who have yet to discover this singular genius.<br/><br/>For more than seventy-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 2,000 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/68/09/9780140286809.jpg', 'title_long': 'Borges Collected Fiction', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 1 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}}, 'pages': 565, 'date_published': '1999', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'World Literature', 'Caribbean & Latin American', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Jorge Luis Borges'], 'title': 'Borges Collected Fiction', 'isbn13': '9780140286809', 'msrp': 24, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0140286802', 'isbn10': '0140286802'}}
