{'book': {'publisher': "McSweeney's", 'synopsis': "In a heartrending and astonishing novel, Eggers illuminates the history of the civil war in Sudan through the eyes of Valentino Achak Deng, a refugee now living in the United States. We follow his life as he's driven from his home as a boy and walks, with thousands of orphans, to Ethiopia, where he finds safety \x97 for a time. Valentino's travels, truly Biblical in scope, bring him in contact with government soldiers, janjaweed-like militias, liberation rebels, hyenas and lions, disease and starvation \x97 and a string of unexpected romances. Ultimately, Valentino finds safety in Kenya and, just after the millennium, is finally resettled in the United States, from where this novel is narrated. In this book, written with expansive humanity and surprising humor, we come to understand the nature of the conflicts in Sudan, the refugee experience in America, the dreams of the Dinka people, and the challenge one indomitable man faces in a world collapsing around him.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/40/9781932416640.jpg', 'title_long': 'What Is the What', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 5.25 Inches, Length: 6.75 Inches, Weight: 1.84375 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.84375}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}}, 'pages': 450, 'date_published': '2006-10-18', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Dave Eggers'], 'title': 'What Is the What', 'isbn13': '9781932416640', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1932416641', 'isbn10': '1932416641'}}
