{'book': {'publisher': 'Abrams Press', 'synopsis': 'Welcome to a new strange world.<br/><br/>In a dazzling work of graphic fiction, a surreal journey through a wonderland eerily like real life, The Book of Leviathan chronicles an infant\'s investigations into life\'s great mysteries. Endowed with a preternatural interest in metaphysics and philosophy, yet as confused as any innocent by the vagaries of adult behavior, little Levi bears the added burden of living in a world that can literally change at the stroke of a pen.<br/><br/>Aided by a wise pet ("Cat") and a favorite toy ("Bunny"), Levi encounters a frothing ectoplasmic Hegel and a woefully off-the-mark Freud. In less heady adventures, Levi contemplates why his parents disappear at night (and whether he is wholeheartedly pleased when they return each morning); the regrettable liberties taken with the English language; and the relationship between Bennetton and Pablo Neruda.<br/><br/>Peter Blegvad\'s Book of Leviathan assembles the cream from Levi and Cat\'s adventures, published in The Independent on Sunday newspaper in the twilight years of the old Millennium. Blegvad\'s darkly humorous work has been described by Matt Groening as "one of the weirdest things I\'ve ever stared at."Quirky and referential, dark and droll by turn, it follows the faceless baby Levi\'s journeys into and out of the world. They are escapes, but as some sage once observed, only a jailer would consider the term "escapist" pejorative.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/87/9781585670987.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Book of Leviathan', 'edition': 'First edition, second printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.999984 Inches, Length: 4.99999 Inches, Weight: 1.14 Pounds, Width: 0.999998 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.99999}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.999998}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.14}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.999984}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2001-04-23', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Comic Strips', 'Graphic Novels', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Peter Blegvad'], 'title': 'The Book of Leviathan', 'isbn13': '9781585670987', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1585670987', 'isbn10': '1585670987'}}
