Looking at new cultural trends, work and social patterns, technologies and means of communication, Zolar reveals the meanings of dreams about cell phones, computers, cyberspace, beepers and much more. His concise and incisive explanations of such classic dreams as meeting a redheaded stranger, flying without wings and trying to comfort a crying baby are here as well, while obsolete subjects -- like girdles, gleaners and grenadiers -- have been eliminated. To complement each dream category a lucky number has been added for this new edition.<br/><br/>With interpretations for more than 20,000 dreams, Zolar\'s Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Dreams offers you the opportunity to uncover the secrets hidden in your dreams and to act on the wisdom -- or respond to the warnings -- they contain.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/26/31/9780743222631.jpg', 'title_long': "Zolar's Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Dreams: Fully Revised and Updated for the 21st Century", 'edition': 'Revised ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.125 Inches, Weight: 1.33600130772 pounds, Width: 1.2 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.2}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.33600130772}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 480, 'date_published': '2004-06-08', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Dreams', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Reference', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Divination'], 'authors': ['Zolar'], 'title': "Zolar's Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Dreams: Fully Revised and Updated for the 21st Century", 'isbn13': '9780743222631', 'msrp': 15.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1451603584'}, 'isbn': '0743222636', 'isbn10': '0743222636', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781451603583', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
