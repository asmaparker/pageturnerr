{'book': {'publisher': 'W. W. Norton & Company', 'synopsis': 'A unique view of Hemingway, the man and the writer, through the women he loved and who loved him. Many books have been written about Ernest Hemingway, but no book has focused on the women he knew and loved and sometimes hated ― his mother, who was the lifelong recipient of his invective; his wives; and others who captivated him. Hemingway married four times, each time to a fascinating person: Hadley Richardson, who shared the Paris years and one son; Pauline Pfeiffer, the mother of two more sons, who created a haven in Key West; Martha Gellhorn, a writer and acclaimed journalist; and Mary Welsh, a Time correspondent. Drawing on letters and interviews with the living women, Bernice Kert sheds new light on the Hemingway heroines and their real-life prototypes. "The best book about Hemingway that has been written for a long time."―Malcolm Cowley "A very valuable book, admirably organized, handsomely written, and continuously interesting."―Carlos Baker "The very different women in Hemingway\'s life come through clearly and strongly . . . a fine balanced work. . . . I couldn\'t stop reading it."―Elizabeth Janeway Illustrated', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/83/57/9780393318357.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Hemingway Women', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.2 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.54544045662 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.54544045662}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2}}, 'pages': 556, 'date_published': '1998-12-17', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Artists, Architects & Photographers', 'Authors', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['Bernice Kert'], 'title': 'The Hemingway Women', 'isbn13': '9780393318357', 'msrp': 28.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0393318354', 'isbn10': '0393318354'}}
