LeGuin<br/><br/>Years before, they had escaped together from the sinister Tombs of Atuanâ€”she, an isolated young priestess, he, a powerful wizard. Now she is a farmer's widow, having chosen for herself the simple pleasures of an ordinary life. And he is a broken old man, mourning the powers lost to him not by choice.<br/><br/>A lifetime ago, they helped each other at a time of darkness and danger. Now they must join forces again, to help another -- the physically and emotionally scarred child whose own destiny remains to be revealed.<br/><br/>With millions of copies sold, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle has earned a treasured place on the shelves of fantasy lovers everywhere. Complex, innovative, and deeply moral, this quintessential fantasy sequence has been compared with the work of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, and has helped make Le Guin one of the most distinguished fantasy and science fiction writers of all time.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/38/9780689845338.jpg', 'title_long': 'Tehanu (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 4)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 4.125 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 252, 'date_published': '2001-09-01', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Classics', 'Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Ursula K.
