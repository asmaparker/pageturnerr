{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'The bestselling author of I Feel Bad About My Neck brilliantly and hilariously resuscitates Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy—two bigger-than-life feuding writers—to give them a post-mortem second act, and the chance to really air their differences.<br/><br/>Although Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy probably only met once in their lives, their names will be linked forever in the history of American literary feuds: they were legendary enemies, especially after McCarthy famously announced to the world that every word Hellman wrote was a lie, “including ‘and’ and ‘the.’” The public battle, and the legal squabbling, that ensued ended, unsatisfactorily for all, with Hellman’s death.<br/><br/>“A sharp-eyed and even sharper-clawed memory-play.... Provides...guilty pleasures, keeping the repartee both snappy and snappish.” —The Wall Street Journal', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/42/22/9781400034222.jpg', 'title_long': 'Imaginary Friends: A Play with Music', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.3 Inches, Length: 4.45 Inches, Weight: 0.34 Pounds, Width: 0.37 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.45}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.37}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.34}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.3}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '2003-03', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'History & Criticism', 'Genres & Styles', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Nora Ephron'], 'title': 'Imaginary Friends: A Play with Music', 'isbn13': '9781400034222', 'msrp': 13, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307486206'}, 'isbn': '1400034221', 'isbn10': '1400034221', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307486202', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
