{'book': {'publisher': 'Plume', 'synopsis': 'Joyce Carol Oates adds to her extraordinary body of work with this stunning National Book Award Finalist filled with violence, love, racism, and a shared secret in mid-century New York.<br/><br/>In the early 1950s in an industrial town, racial boundaries may keep people apart—or bring them together explosively. Iris Courtney, who is white, is the only witness when handsome Jinx Fairchild, a black basketball player, kills a white man in order to protect her.<br/><br/>The secret link between Iris and Jinx is not only their attraction to each other, but a bond of passion and guilt that has formed between them. This one irrevocable, tragic act shapes their lives and alters their destinies in Joyce Carol Oates’s finest, emotion-packed novel—a work critics call a masterpiece, the best work of America’s best writer of contemporary realism.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/58/13/9780452265813.jpg', 'title_long': 'Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart', 'edition': '~', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.96 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.8 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.8}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.96}}, 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '1991-03-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'Tragedy', 'Genre Fiction', 'Coming of Age', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Joyce Carol Oates'], 'title': 'Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart', 'isbn13': '9780452265813', 'msrp': 13.35, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0452265819', 'isbn10': '0452265819'}}
