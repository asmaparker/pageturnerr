{'book': {'publisher': 'Headline Book Publishing', 'synopsis': "Garry Nelson's account of a run-of-the-mill season with Charlton Athletic instantly established itself as a soccer classic. It reveals more about the up-and-down reality of being a football player than any number of star autobiographies. Its focus is on the overcrowded treatment room, comeback games for the stiffs in front of a few fans, and the occasional highs before the next low strikes you from behind. Told with wit, intelligence, and insight, it is a riveting story as we come to appreciate one man's efforts to earn a living playing the game he loves and to which he has contributed so much.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/28/9780747251828.jpg', 'title_long': 'Left Foot Forward: A Year in the Life of a Journeyman Footballer', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.9 Inches, Length: 4.1 Inches, Weight: 0.46517537282 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.1}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.46517537282}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.9}}, 'pages': 375, 'date_published': '1996-05-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Biographies', 'Soccer'], 'authors': ['Garry Nelson'], 'title': 'Left Foot Forward: A Year in the Life of a Journeyman Footballer', 'isbn13': '9780747251828', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0747251827', 'isbn10': '0747251827'}}
