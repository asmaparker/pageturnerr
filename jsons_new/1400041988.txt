{'book': {'publisher': "Everyman's Library", 'synopsis': 'One of the best-loved of Nabokov’s novels, Pnin features his funniest and most heart-rending character. Serialized in The New Yorker and published in book form in 1957, Pnin brought Nabokov both his first National Book Award nomination and hitherto unprecedented popularity.<br/><br/>“Fun and satire are just the beginning of the rewards of this novel. Generous, bewildered Pnin, that most kindly and impractical of men, wins our affection and respect.” —Chicago Tribune<br/><br/>Professor Timofey Pnin is a haplessly disoriented Russian émigré precariously employed on an American college campus in the 1950s. Pnin struggles to maintain his dignity through a series of comic and sad misunder-standings, all the while falling victim both to subtle academic conspiracies and to the manipulations of a deliberately unreliable narrator.<br/><br/>Initially an almost grotesquely comic figure, Pnin gradually grows in stature by contrast with those who laugh at him. Whether taking the wrong train to deliver a lecture in a language he has not mastered or throwing a faculty party during which he learns he is losing his job, the gently preposterous hero of this enchanting novel evokes the reader’s deepest protective instinct.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/85/9781400041985.jpg', 'title_long': "Pnin: Introduction by David Lodge (Everyman's Library Contemporary Classics Series)", 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.29 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.65 Pounds, Width: 0.65 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.65}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.65}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.29}}, 'pages': 184, 'date_published': '2004-04-06', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Humor & Satire', 'Satire', 'Humorous', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Vladimir Nabokov'], 'title': "Pnin: Introduction by David Lodge (Everyman's Library Contemporary Classics Series)", 'isbn13': '9781400041985', 'msrp': 21, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '1400041988', 'isbn10': '1400041988', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307787477', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
