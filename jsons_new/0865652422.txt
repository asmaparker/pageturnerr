Absorbing." ―Publishers Weekly<br/>Tuscan Countess is a fast-paced and colorful exploration of the life of Matilda of Canossa (c. 1046–1115), a woman who loved a pope and was loved by him, successfully defied the Holy Roman Emperor, and changed the map of Europe. Matilda of Canossa, the "Great Countess," was a remarkable woman. Her personal power was so extraordinary that even centuries after her death she became the first woman to be interred in St. Peter\'s Basilica. She is best remembered for her role in the conflict between the papacy and the Holy Roman emperor, the climax of which took place at her castle of Canossa.<br/>This unique biography is also a journal of the author\'s travels through contemporary Tuscany as she explores the palaces where Matilda held court, the blood-stained plains on which her soldiers battled, the churches and cathedrals she endowed, and the fortified aeries where she sought refuge. Readers will be swept along on this engrossing journey retracing the steps of a courageous and brilliant woman.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/24/22/9780865652422.jpg', 'title_long': 'Tuscan Countess: The Life and Extraordinary Times of Matilda of Canossa (Mark Magowan Books)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.45064168396 Pounds, Width: 1.125 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.125}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.45064168396}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 312, 'date_published': '2004-09-28', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Churches & Church Leadership', 'Church History', 'History', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Europe', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Royalty', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'World', 'Religious', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Michele K.
