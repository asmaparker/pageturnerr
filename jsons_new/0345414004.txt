{'book': {'publisher': 'Del Rey', 'synopsis': '"AS JOYOUS TO READ AS IT IS PROVOCATIVE . . . Friday is all woman . . . She is as strong and resourceful and decisive as any Heinlein hero; in addition she is loving (oh, yes) and tender and very, very female."<br/>--Los Angeles Times<br/><br/>Friday is a secret courier. She is employed by a man known to her only as "Boss." Operating from and over a near-future Earth, where chaos is the happy norm, she finds herself on assignment at Boss\'s seemingly whimsical behest. From New Zealand to Canada, from one to another of the new states of America\'s disunion, she keeps her balance nimbly with quick, expeditious solutions to one calamity and scrape after another.<br/><br/>Not since Valentine Michael Smith, hero of the bestselling Stranger in a Strange Land, has Robert Heinlein created a more captivating protagonist. Friday proves once again why Robert Heinlein\'s novels have sold more than 50 million copies, have won countless awards, and have earned him the title of Grand Master of Science Fiction.<br/><br/>"FRIDAY IS A SUPERBEING. . . . Engineered from the finest genes, and trained to be a secret courier in a future world of chaotic ferocity and intrigue, she can think better and make love better than any of the normal people around her."<br/>--The New York Times Book Review', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/07/9780345414007.jpg', 'title_long': 'Friday', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '1997-06-17', 'subjects': ['Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Opera'], 'authors': ['Robert A.
