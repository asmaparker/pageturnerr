{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'The screenplay for Kubrick’s 1962 film tells the story of an older man’s obsession with a young girl. • This is the purely Nabokov version of the screenplay and not the same version which was produced as the motion picture Lolita, distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.<br/><br/>“A few days before, at a private screening, I had discovered that Kubrick was a great director, that his Lolita was a first-rate film with magnificent actors, and that only ragged odds and ends of my script had been used. The modifications, the garbling of my best little finds, the omission of entire scenes, the addition of new ones, and all sorts of other changes may not have been sufficient to erase my name from the credit titles but they certainly made the picture as unfaithful to the original script as an American poet’s translation from Rimbaud or Pasternak.<br/><br/>I hasten to add that my present comments should definitely not be construed as reflecting any belated grudge, any high-pitched deprecation of Kubrick’s creative approach. When adapting Lolita to the speaking screen he saw my novel in one way, I saw it in another – that’s all, nor can one deny that infinite fidelity may be an author’s ideal but can prove a producer’s ruin.”<br/><br/>--- From the foreword', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/52/9780679772552.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lolita: A Screenplay (Vintage International)', 'edition': 'Second Vintage International Edition June 1997', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.94 Inches, Length: 5.21 Inches, Weight: 0.66 Pounds, Width: 0.51 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.21}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.51}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.66}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.94}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '1997-08-26', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Screenplays', 'Screenwriting', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dramas & Plays', 'United States', 'Genre Fiction', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Vladimir Nabokov'], 'title': 'Lolita: A Screenplay (Vintage International)', 'isbn13': '9780679772552', 'msrp': 15, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307787605'}, 'isbn': '0679772553', 'isbn10': '0679772553', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307787606', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
