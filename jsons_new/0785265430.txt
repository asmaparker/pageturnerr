{'book': {'publisher': 'Thomas Nelson Inc', 'synopsis': '"Allah has bought from the Umma-the true believers of Islam-their selves and their substance in return for Paradise; they fight in the way of Allah, killing and being killed. Their promise is written in the blood of the moon." -From the Koran, chap. 9, v. 112<br/>The conflict between Islam and the West existed long before the destruction of the World Trade Center and the other events that recently touched America. It goes back hundreds, even thousands, of years. Yet the struggle is upon us now as never before. In this well-reasoned, accessible book, Middle East expert George Grant answers the troubling questions on many believers\' minds. Who are the followers of Islam, and what do they believe? What could have motivated those who carried out the acts of terror on September 11? Why has there been tension between Islam and the West for centuries? What are the true meanings of terms such as Ji\'had, Intifada, and Dhimma? And is there any hope for peace? The call upon believers now-as always-is to prepare and equip ourselves so that we may stand fast. The Blood of the Moon will help readers better understand the history of Islam and its struggle with the Western world, as well as how Christians can share the message of salvation through Jesus Christ with the followers of Allah.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/54/36/9780785265436.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Blood Of The Moon Understanding The Historic Struggle Between Islam And Western Civilization', 'edition': 'Revised', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.50044933474 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.50044933474}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 207, 'date_published': '2001-12-18', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Islam', 'Religious Studies', 'Comparative Religion'], 'authors': ['George Grant'], 'title': 'The Blood Of The Moon Understanding The Historic Struggle Between Islam And Western Civilization', 'isbn13': '9780785265436', 'msrp': 13.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1418529664'}, 'isbn': '0785265430', 'isbn10': '0785265430', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781418529666', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
