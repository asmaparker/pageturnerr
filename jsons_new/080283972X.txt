{'book': {'publisher': 'Eerdmans', 'synopsis': "Foreword by Patrick D. Miller<br/><br/>In this remarkable, acclaimed history of the development of monotheism, Mark S. Smith explains how Israel's religion evolved from a cult of Yahweh as a primary deity among many to a fully defined monotheistic faith with Yahweh as sole god. Repudiating the traditional view that Israel was fundamentally different in culture and religion from its Canaanite neighbors, this provocative book argues that Israelite religion developed, at least in part, from the religion of Canaan. Drawing on epigraphic and archaeological sources, Smith cogently demonstrates that Israelite religion was not an outright rejection of foreign, pagan gods but, rather, was the result of the progressive establishment of a distinctly separate Israelite identity. This thoroughly revised second edition ofThe Early History of God includes a substantial new preface by the author and a foreword by Patrick D. Miller.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/97/25/9780802839725.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel (The Biblical Resource Series)', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.95019234922 Pounds, Width: 0.741 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.741}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95019234922}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 289, 'date_published': '2002-08-03', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Churches & Church Leadership', 'Church History', 'History', 'Ancient Civilizations', 'Middle East', 'Israel & Palestine', 'World', 'Religious', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Judaism', 'Religious Studies', 'Comparative Religion', 'Sociology', 'Theology', 'Politics & Social Sciences'], 'authors': ['Mark S.
