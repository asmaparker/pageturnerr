{'book': {'publisher': 'Norton, 2007', 'synopsis': '“Will shape our thinking about America and the Middle East for years.”―Christopher Dickey, Newsweek This best-selling history is the first fully comprehensive history of America’s involvement in the Middle East from George Washington to George W. Bush. As Niall Ferguson writes, “If you think America’s entanglement in the Middle East began with Roosevelt and Truman, Michael Oren’s deeply researched and brilliantly written history will be a revelation to you, as it was to me. With its cast of fascinating characters―earnest missionaries, maverick converts, wide-eyed tourists, and even a nineteenth-century George Bush―Power, Faith, and Fantasy is not only a terrific read, it is also proof that you don’t really understand an issue until you know its history.” 68 black-and-white photographs, 4 maps', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/82/60/9780393058260.jpg', 'title_long': 'Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25195 Inches, Length: 6.37794 Inches, Weight: 2.53090676776 Pounds, Width: 1.7070832 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.37794}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.7070832}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.53090676776}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25195}}, 'pages': 778, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Middle East', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Politics & Government', 'International & World Politics', 'Political Science'], 'authors': ['Michael B.
