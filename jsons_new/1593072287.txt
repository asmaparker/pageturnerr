In this rapidly converging landscape, cyborg super-agent Major Motoko Kusanagi is charged to track down the craftiest and most dangerous terrorists and cybercriminals, including "ghost hackers," capable of exploiting the human/machine interface by re-programming human minds to become puppets to carry out their criminal ends. When Major Kusanagi tracks the cybertrail of one such master hacker, the Puppeteer, her quest leads her into a world beyond information and technology where the very nature of consciousness and the human soul are turned upside-down and inside-out.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/22/85/9781593072285.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ghost In The Shell, Vol. 1, 2nd Edition', 'edition': '2nd', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.75 Inches, Weight: 1.19931470528 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.19931470528}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2004-11-16', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Science Fiction', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Masamune Shirow'], 'title': 'Ghost In The Shell, Vol. 1, 2nd Edition', 'isbn13': '9781593072285', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1593072287', 'isbn10': '1593072287'}}
