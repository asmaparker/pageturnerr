{'book': {'publisher': 'Knopf', 'synopsis': 'With The Sportswriter, in 1986, Richard Ford commenced a cycle of novels that ten years later—after Independence Day won both the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award—was hailed by The Times of London as “an extraordinary epic [that] is nothing less than the story of the twentieth century itself.” Now, a decade later, Frank Bascombe returns, with a new lease on life (and real estate), more acutely in thrall to life’s endless complexities than ever before.<br/><br/>His story resumes in the autumn of 2000, when his trade as a realtor on the Jersey Shore is thriving, permitting him to revel in the acceptance of “that long, stretching-out time when my dreams would have mystery like any ordinary person’s; when whatever I do or say, who I marry, how my kids turn out, becomes what the world—if it makes note at all—knows of me, how I’m seen, understood, even how I think of myself before whatever there is that’s wild and unassuagable rises and cheerlessly hauls me off to oblivion.” But as a Presidential election hangs in the balance, and a postnuclear-family Thanksgiving looms before him along with crises both marital and medical, Frank discovers that what he terms the Permanent Period is fraught with unforeseen perils: “All the ways that life feels like life at age fifty-five were strewn around me like poppies.”<br/><br/>A holiday, and a novel, no reader will ever forget—at once hilarious, harrowing, surprising, and profound. The Lay of the Land is astonishing in its own right and a magnificent expansion of one of the most celebrated chronicles of our time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/46/87/9780679454687.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Lay of the Land', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.2 Inches, Length: 6.2 Inches, Weight: 1.8619 Pounds, Width: 1.7 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.7}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.8619}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.2}}, 'pages': 485, 'date_published': '2006-10-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Psychological', 'Contemporary', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Richard Ford'], 'title': 'The Lay of the Land', 'isbn13': '9780679454687', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307267121', 'ePub': '0307267121'}, 'isbn': '0679454683', 'isbn10': '0679454683', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307267122', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
