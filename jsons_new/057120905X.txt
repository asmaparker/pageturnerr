{'book': {'publisher': 'Gardners Books', 'synopsis': "In the final days of the Second World War, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley scrawls his desperate account on the walls and ceilings of his ice-cold prison high in the Austrian Alps. Officers of the liberating army discover his frozen, disfigured corpse and his astonishing testament - the sordid truth that he alone possessed. Fascinated but horrified, they learn of a dazzling array of characters caught up in a scandal and political corruption.Famous Last Words is part-thriller, part-horror story; it is also a meditation on history and the human soul and it is Findley's fine achievement that he has combined these elements into a web that constantly surprises and astounds the reader.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/57/9780571209057.jpg', 'title_long': 'Famous Last Words', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 4.96062 Inches, Weight: 0.95239697184 Pounds, Width: 1.02 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.96062}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.02}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.95239697184}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 396, 'date_published': '2001-10-31', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Timothy Findley'], 'title': 'Famous Last Words', 'isbn13': '9780571209057', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '057120905X', 'isbn10': '057120905X'}}
