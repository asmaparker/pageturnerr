{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "“I like croquet and peanut butter and making my bed.”<br/><br/>There is only one way for Chester to do things—his own way. “You definitely have a mind of your own,” said Chester’s mother. “That’s one way to put it,” said Chester’s father.<br/>Luckily Chester’s best friend, Wilson, likes doing things just the same way as Chester. When they cut their sandwiches, it's always diagonally. When they ride their bikes, they always use hand signals. If Chester is hungry, Wilson is too. They're two of a kind—until indomitable Lilly, who has her own way of doing things, moves into the neighborhood. Because Lilly has her own way of doing things!<br/>Written and illustrated by Kevin Henkes, the nationally bestselling and celebrated creator of Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse, Kitten's First Full Moon, and Chrysanthemum, Chester's Way is a classic picture book about friendship for kids ages 3-7. With sweet good humor and charming pictures, the book's themes of making new friends, accepting others, and trying new things resonate when curled up with a parent or at story time.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/47/21/9780688154721.jpg', 'title_long': "Chester's Way", 'dimensions': 'Height: 10.25 Inches, Length: 8 Inches, Weight: 0.22487150724 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.22487150724}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.25}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '1997-09-22', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Activities, Crafts & Games', 'Activity Books', 'Humor', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Kevin Henkes'], 'title': "Chester's Way", 'isbn13': '9780688154721', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0688154727', 'isbn10': '0688154727'}}
