{'book': {'publisher': 'Weiser', 'synopsis': 'Exploring the Northern Tradition is an introduction to the modern reconstruction of the ancient religion of the Germanic and Scandinavian peoples. This religion, called Heathenry, is one of the fastest growing polytheistic religious movements in the United States today. This book provides a thorough guide to the cosmology, values, ethics, and rituals practiced by modern Heathens. It crosses denominational lines, examining practices common to all branches of Heathenry in an easily accessible format. Readers will have the opportunity to explore the sacred stories of the various Heathen Gods, like Odin, Frigga, Freya, and Thor, and the devotional practices of modern votaries. The most common devotional rite--the faining or blot--is examined in rich detail, with examples given for personal use.<br/>Additionally, readers are introduced to the concept of wyrd or fate, so integral to the Heathen worldview. For those new to Heathenry, Pagans who wish to learn more about the Norse Deities, or those simply interested in learning about this unique religion, Exploring the Northern Tradition is the perfect introduction. Subjects covered include: -- The gods and goddesses -- Symbel -- The soul matrix -- Ethics and values of the modern heathen -- The history and evolution of modern Heathenry<br/>Unlike many books on Heathenry, Exploring the Northern Tradition is not denomination specific, nor does it seek to overwhelm the reader with unfamiliar Anglo-Saxon or Norse terminology. Every new concept covered is presented in a clear and easy-to-understand manner. Readers will come away from this book with a thorough knowledge of what the Heathen community is like and what newcomers to that community can expect. Experienced Heathens will find a wealth of lore and inter-denominational critique that will make this book an excellent addition to their libraries.<br/>The author, Galina Krasskova draws on her own 12 years of experience as a Heathen priest or weofodthignen. She is currently Aeweweard in Thaet Angelseaxisce Ealdriht and has studied interfaith ministry in NYC (where she is registered with the state as a minister). Drawing upon the foundation of her own experience as a Heathen, Rev. Krasskova provides a window into this faith that seeks to unite the wisdom of the past with the devotional inspiration of the present.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/12/9781564147912.jpg', 'title_long': 'Exploring the Northern Tradition: A Guide to the Gods, Lore, Rites, and Celebrations From the Norse, German, and Anglo-Saxon Traditions (Exploring Series)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.00220462262 Pounds, Width: 0.47 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.47}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.00220462262}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2005-05-15', 'subjects': ['Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Divination', 'Wicca, Witchcraft & Paganism', 'Occult & Paranormal', 'Magic Studies', 'Religious Studies', 'Comparative Religion'], 'authors': ['Galina Krasskova'], 'title': 'Exploring the Northern Tradition: A Guide to the Gods, Lore, Rites, and Celebrations From the Norse, German, and Anglo-Saxon Traditions (Exploring Series)', 'isbn13': '9781564147912', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1601636954'}, 'isbn': '1564147916', 'isbn10': '1564147916', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781601636959', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
