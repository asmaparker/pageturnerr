{'book': {'publisher': 'Bantam', 'synopsis': 'Arguably the greatest science fiction writer who ever lived, Isaac Asimov also possessed one of the most brilliant and original minds of our time. His accessible style and far-reaching interests in subjects ranging from science to humor to history earned him the nickname “the Great Explainer.” I. Asimov is his personal story—vivid, open, and honest—as only Asimov himself could tell it.<br/><br/>Here is the story of the paradoxical genius who wrote of travel to the stars yet refused to fly in airplanes; who imagined alien universes and vast galactic civilizations while staying home to write; who compulsively authored more than 470 books yet still found the time to share his ideas with some of the great minds of our century. Here are his wide-ranging thoughts and sharp-eyed observations on everything from religion to politics, love and divorce, friendship and Hollywood, fame and mortality. Here, too, is a riveting behind-the-scenes look at the varied personalities—Campbell, Ellison, Heinlein, Clarke, del Rey, Silverberg, and others—who along with Asimov helped shape science fiction.<br/><br/>As unique and irrepressible as the man himself, I. Asimov is the candid memoir of an incomparable talent who entertained readers for nearly half a century and whose work will surely endure into the future he so vividly envisioned.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/71/9780553569971.jpg', 'title_long': 'I, Asimov: A Memoir', 'edition': 'NO-VALUE', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.69 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.76279942652 Pounds, Width: 1.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.76279942652}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.69}}, 'pages': 608, 'date_published': '1995-01-01', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Memoirs', 'Professionals & Academics', 'Scientists', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Isaac Asimov'], 'title': 'I, Asimov: A Memoir', 'isbn13': '9780553569971', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307573532'}, 'isbn': '055356997X', 'isbn10': '055356997X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307573537', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
