{'book': {'publisher': 'Artisan', 'synopsis': "<p><br>it Is Hard, Today, To Imagine A Time When The Word Bittersweet Was Rarely Spoken, When 70 Percent Of The Chocolate Purchased By Americans Was Milk Chocolate. Today's World Of Chocolate Is A Much Larger Universe, Where Not Only Is The Quality Better And Variety Wider, But The Very Composition Of The Chocolate Has Changed. <p>to Do Justice To These New Chocolates, Which Contain More Pure Chocolate And Less Sugar, We Need A Fresh Approach To Chocolate Desserts&#8212;a New Kind Of Recipe&#8212;and Someone To Crack The Code For Substituting One Chocolate For Another In Both New And Classic Recipes. Alice Medrich, The &quot;first Lady Of Chocolate,&quot; Delivers.<p>with Nearly 150 Recipes&#8212;each Delicious And Foolproof, No Matter Your Level Of Expertise&#8212;<em>bittersweet</em> Answers Every Chocolate Question, Teaches Every Technique, Confides Every Secret, Satisfies Every Craving. You'll Marvel That Recipes As Basic As Brownies And Chocolate Cake, Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream And Chocolate Mousse, Can Still Surprise And Excite You, And That Souffl&eacute;s, Chocolate Panna Cotta, Even Pasta Sauces Can Be So Dramatically Flavorful.<p>for The Last Thirty Years, Alice Medrich Has Been Learning, Teaching, And Sharing What She Loves And Understands About Chocolate. <em>bittersweet</em> Is The Culmination Of Her Life In Chocolate Thus Far&#58; Revolutionary Recipes, Profound Knowledge, And Charming Tales Of A Chocolate Life.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>medrich Founded The Dessert Shop Cocolat In Berkeley In 1976 And Authored Cocolat And Chocolate And The Art Of Low-fat Desserts, Which Offered New, More Adult Flavors Than The Super-sweet Tastes In Vogue Until That Time. Today, As Medrich Points Out In An Interestingly Market-savvy Introduction, The Popularity Of High-quality Brands Of Chocolate Is On The Rise, And Each Of These Recipes Includes Notes About How To Alter It Using Chocolates With A Higher Percentage Of Chocolate Liquor, Or Cocoa Bean Content. This All Sounds Highly Cerebral, But Once Medrich Puts Her Theory Into Practice In The Form Of Macadamia Shortbread Brownies, And Grappa, Currants, And Pine Nut Torte, It Becomes Deliciously Clear. Hers Are Highly Inventive Creations, Grouped In Chapters Loosely Defined More By Feel Than By Strict Adherence To Categories, Such As A Group Of Fluffy Confections That Includes Intensely Bittersweet Souffl S And Melting Chocolate Meringue. Medrich Provides A Recipe For Her Signature Queen Of Sheba Torte, Along With Detailed Notes About How It Has Evolved Over The Years. She Even Uses Chocolate In A Handful Of Savory Recipes, Such As Roasted Squash Soup With Cocoa Bean Cream. Clearly, This Author's Curiosity Is Her Defining Characteristic; Her Ability To Convey The Fruits Of That Curiosity Is The Readers' Good Fortune. (oct.) Forecast: Medrich's Cocolat (1990) Was An Iacp And James Beard Award Winner, And Chocolate And The Art Of Low-fat Desserts (1994) Was Also The Recipient Of A James Beard Award. This Highly Personal, Engaging Collection Is Likely To Garner Prizes As Well, And Artisan Is Supporting It With A 45,000 First Printing And A 10-city Tour. This Is Bound To Be One Of Fall's Big Books, And It Deserves To Be.
