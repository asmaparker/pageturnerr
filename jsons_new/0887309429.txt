{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Business', 'synopsis': "From America's most trusted financial advisor comes a comprehensive guide to a new and utterly sane financial choice. In Die Broke, you'll learn that life is a game where the loser gives his money to Uncle Sam at the end. There are four steps to the process:<br/>Quit Today<br/>No, don't tell your boss to shove it...at least not out loud. But in your head accept that from this day on you're a free agent whose number one workplace priority is your personal bottom line.<br/>Pay Cash<br/>You should be as conscious of spending as you are of saving. Credit should be a rarely used tool for those few times (buying homes and cars) when paying cash is impossible.<br/>Don't Retire<br/>Your work life should be a journey up and down hills, rather than a climb up a sheer cliff that ends with a jump into the abyss.<br/>Die Broke<br/>It sounds terrifying, the one intolerable outcome to your financial life. And yet, in truth, dying broke might be your best option for a life without fear: fear of failure and privation now, fear of impoverishment in the long run.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/27/9780887309427.jpg', 'title_long': 'Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.73 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.73}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '1998-09-23', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Economics', 'Finance', 'Investing', 'Introduction', 'Personal Finance', 'Budgeting & Money Management', 'Retirement Planning', 'Accounting', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Stephen Pollan', 'Mark Levine'], 'title': 'Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan', 'isbn13': '9780887309427', 'msrp': 12.98, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'eBook': '006184697X', 'ePub': '006184697X'}, 'isbn': '0887309429', 'isbn10': '0887309429', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061846977', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
