{'book': {'publisher': 'Andrews McMeel Publishing', 'synopsis': "When Dilbert first appeared in newspapers across the country in 1989, office workers looked around suspiciously. Was its creator, Scott Adams, a pen name for someone who worked amongst them? After all, the humor was just too eerily funny and familiar. Since then, Dilbert has become more than a cartoon character. He's become an office icon. In Another Day in Cubicle Paradise Dilbert and his cohorts, Dogbert, Catbert, Ratbert, and the pointy-haired boss, once again entertain with their cubicle humor. From bizarre personnel decisions to meetings gone bad, from schizoid secretaries to consultants from hell, Another Day in Cubicle Paradise provides a way to get all those darn comic strips off the breakroom bulletin board.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/46/9780740721946.jpg', 'title_long': 'Another Day In Cubicle Paradise: A Dilbert Book (Volume 19)', 'edition': 'Original ed.', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.5 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 0.67020527648 Pounds, Width: 0.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.67020527648}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.5}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2002-03-01', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Comic Strips', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Scott Adams'], 'title': 'Another Day In Cubicle Paradise: A Dilbert Book (Volume 19)', 'isbn13': '9780740721946', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0740721941', 'isbn10': '0740721941', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781449424282', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
