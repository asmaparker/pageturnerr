{'book': {'publisher': "Everyman's Library", 'synopsis': "This beautiful hardcover edition–containing all three cantos, Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso–includes an introduction by Nobel Prize-winning poet Eugenio Montale, a chronology, notes, and a bibliography. Also included are forty-two drawings selected from Botticelli's marvelous late-fifteenth-century series of illustrations.<br/><br/>The Divine Comedy begins in a shadowed forest on Good Friday in the year 1300. It proceeds on a journey that, in its intense recreation of the depths and the heights of human experience, has become the key with which Western civilization has sought to unlock the mystery of its own identity.<br/><br/>Allen Mandelbaum’s astonishingly Dantean translation, which captures so much of the life of the original, renders whole for us the masterpiece of that genius whom our greatest poets have recognized as a central model for all poets.<br/><br/>Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket. Everyman’s Library Classics include an introduction, a select bibliography, and a chronology of the author's life and times.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/31/32/9780679433132.jpg', 'title_long': "The Divine Comedy: Inferno; Purgatorio; Paradiso (Everyman's Library)", 'edition': 'One-volume', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.3 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 1.89377083058 Pounds, Width: 1.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.89377083058}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.3}}, 'pages': 798, 'date_published': '1995-08-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Poetry', 'Regional & Cultural', 'Themes & Styles', 'World Literature', 'European', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Dante Alighieri'], 'title': "The Divine Comedy: Inferno; Purgatorio; Paradiso (Everyman's Library)", 'isbn13': '9780679433132', 'msrp': 27, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0679433139', 'isbn10': '0679433139'}}
