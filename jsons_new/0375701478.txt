{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'Critical reading for parents, educators, and anyone wanting to understand the tragic epidemic of suicide—”a powerful book [that] will change people\'s lives—and, doubtless, save a few" (Newsday).<br/><br/>The first major book in a quarter century on suicide—and its terrible pull on the young in particular—Night Falls Fast is tragically timely: suicide has become one of the most common killers of Americans between the ages of fifteen and forty-five.<br/><br/>From the author of the best-selling memoir, An Unquiet Mind—and an internationally acknowledged authority on depression—Dr. Jamison has also known suicide firsthand: after years of struggling with manic-depression, she tried at age twenty-eight to kill herself. Weaving together a historical and scientific exploration of the subject with personal essays on individual suicides, she brings not only her remarkable compassion and literary skill but also all of her knowledge and research to bear on this devastating problem. This is a book that helps us to understand the suicidal mind, to recognize and come to the aid of those at risk, and to comprehend the profound effects on those left behind.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/14/74/9780375701474.jpg', 'title_long': 'Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.94 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.71209310626 Pounds, Width: 0.99 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.99}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.71209310626}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.94}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '2000-10-10', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Death & Grief', 'Suicide', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Post-traumatic Stress Disorder'], 'authors': ['Kay Redfield Jamison'], 'title': 'Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide', 'isbn13': '9780375701474', 'msrp': 16.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307779890'}, 'isbn': '0375701478', 'isbn10': '0375701478', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307779892', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
