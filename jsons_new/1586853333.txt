You\'d like to see him get some exercise. You\'d like to see him get out from in front of the television. And you\'d love for him to be motivated enough to find some stuff to do on his own.<br/>This boy NEEDS The Big Book of Boy Stuff!<br/>This thick, durable book includes fascinating chapters on gross stuff, magic, emergencies, fireworks, games, experiments, jokes, activities, insults, pets, flying things, and, of course, duct tape.<br/>Boys can learn fun experiments such as how to create a "Monster in a Box" using a shoebox, a flowerpot, and a potato. Next, they can work on building a pneumatic rocket made out of a lip balm tube and air. The sky is truly the limit when it comes to these fun and entertaining projects. No boyhood is complete without a copy!<br/>The Big Book of Boy Stuff has all the important information that boys just have to know: How can I make a rocket? What do I do if I get a bean stuck up my nose? How can I make lightning without killing myself?<br/>Where can I find new practical jokes? What is the best way to poop outside? How do I tell a girl I like her? Why would I tell a girl I like her? How many mosquitoes does it take to suck all the blood out of a person? What\'s that smell? . . . and many, many more!<br/>The veteran of many water-balloon wars, Bart King has twice won the prized "Arrested Development" award from the New York Society of Amateur Psychologists. He has been a middle-school teacher for the past fifteen years. This is his first book, unless you count that other one he wrote.
