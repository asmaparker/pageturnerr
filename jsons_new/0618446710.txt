{'book': {'publisher': 'Mariner Books', 'synopsis': "Darcy Frey chronicles the aspirations of four young men as they navigate the NCAA recruitment process, their only hope of escape from a life of crime, poverty, and despair.<br/><br/>It ought to be just a game, but basketball on the playgrounds of Coney Island is much more than that. In The Last Shot, the aspirations of a few of the neighborhood's most promising players reveal that what they have going for them (athletic talent, grace, and years of dedication) may not be enough to defeat what's working against them: woefully inadequate schooling, family circumstances that are often desperate, and the slick, brutal world of college athletic recruitment.<br/><br/>Incisively and compassionately written, The Last Shot introduces us to unforgettable characters and takes us into their world with an intimacy seldom seen in contemporary journalism. The result is a startling and poignant expos√© of inner-city life and the big business of college basketball.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/67/11/9780618446711.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.54 pounds, Width: 0.564 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.564}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.54}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '2004-03-03', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Basketball', 'Miscellaneous', 'Journalism', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Research', 'Sociology', 'Race Relations'], 'authors': ['Darcy Frey'], 'title': 'The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams', 'isbn13': '9780618446711', 'msrp': 10.01, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Page Fidelity': '0547524633', 'eBook': '0547524633'}, 'isbn': '0618446710', 'isbn10': '0618446710', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780547524634', 'binding': 'saleableprint'}]}}
