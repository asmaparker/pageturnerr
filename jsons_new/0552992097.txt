{'book': {'publisher': 'Pocket Books', 'synopsis': '“The first of my father’s illusions was that bears could survive the life lived by human beings, and the second was that human beings could survive a life led in hotels.” So says John Berry, son of a hapless dreamer, brother to a cadre of eccentric siblings, and chronicler of the lives lived, the loves experienced, the deaths met, and the myriad strange and wonderful times encountered by the family Berry. Hoteliers, pet-bear owners, friends of Freud (the animal trainer and vaudevillian, that is), and playthings of mad fate, they “dream on” in a funny, sad, outrageous, and moving novel by the remarkable author of A Prayer for Owen Meany and Last Night in Twisted River.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20/91/9780552992091.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Hotel New Hampshire', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Weight: 0.82452885988 Pounds, Width: 1.25984 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1181}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25984}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.82452885988}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 520, 'date_published': '1998', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction'], 'authors': ['John Irving'], 'title': 'The Hotel New Hampshire', 'isbn13': '9780552992091', 'msrp': 16.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0552992097', 'isbn10': '0552992097'}}
