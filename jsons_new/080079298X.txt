{'book': {'publisher': 'Chosen Books Pub Co', 'synopsis': 'Is there a God who cares about me? Will he show me the right thing to do? Will he forgive and heal me? In Meeting God at Every Turn, Catherine Marshall gives readers a resounding "Yes!" to these questions and more as she describes how she met God at the confusing, troubled, and scary points in her life.<br/>The twelve "turnings" that Marshall describes are the type of events that shape a person: growing up, love and marriage, facing death, making a living, starting over in relationships and business, and more. Meeting God at Every Turn tells what happened each time Catherine turned a corner-how she surprisingly encountered grace. It\'s her story, but every reader\'s too. Thirteen pages of family photographs are included.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/85/9780800792985.jpg', 'title_long': 'Meeting God at Every Turn', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.75 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.75}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Leaders & Notable People', 'Religious', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Catherine Marshall'], 'title': 'Meeting God at Every Turn', 'isbn13': '9780800792985', 'msrp': 5.25, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '080079298X', 'isbn10': '080079298X'}}
