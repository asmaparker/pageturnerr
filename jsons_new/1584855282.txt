Feelings get more complex and moods start swinging. This title helps girls learn to deal with their feelings. They\'ll get tips, how-to\'s, and straightforward advice on expressing feelings, understanding them, and handling them. Topics covered include: Sweaty Palms and Knocking Knees, Why Do You Cry?, Feeling Out of Control, Sorting it Out, Feeling Positive, Reaching Out to Others, Includes a section with strategies for coping with specific emotions (fear, anxiety, jealousy, anger, loneliness, sadness, grief, feeling safe).
