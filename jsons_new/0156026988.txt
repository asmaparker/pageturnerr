{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Paperbacks', 'synopsis': 'New York Times Bestseller<br/>The dazzling short story collection by music legend Jimmy Buffett inspired by his real life.<br/>"Good natured tales of free-spirited characters . . . In fact, Buffett\'s lighthearted endorsement of adventure is so persuasive that, upon finishing the book, many readers will be tempted to get out their maps." —The New York Times Book Review<br/>Margaritaville may not appear on a map, but it does exist—at least in the brilliantly creative, sometimes slightly skewed imagination of Jimmy Buffett. Tales from Margaritaville is a collection of short stories (some purely fiction, some based in truth) so vividly packed with restless dreamers, wild wanderers, and pure gypsy souls that just reading it is a wild adventure. Travel along with a cowboy named Tully Mars, as he heads from Heartache, Wyoming to Graceland, and relive the autobiographical odyssey of a third-generation sailor and first-rate musical outlaw. With unforgettable stories that present the true roamer\'s twin loves—the sea and the road—Tales from Margaritaville is one "smooth sailing book of infinite imagination" (Chicago Sun-Times).', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/69/87/9780156026987.jpg', 'title_long': 'Tales From Margaritaville (Harvest Book)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 0.62 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.62}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 264, 'date_published': '2002-06-03', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'New Adult & College', 'Romantic Comedy', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jimmy Buffett'], 'title': 'Tales From Margaritaville (Harvest Book)', 'isbn13': '9780156026987', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0156026988', 'isbn10': '0156026988'}}
