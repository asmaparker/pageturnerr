{'book': {'publisher': 'Penguin Books', 'synopsis': "From the author of White Noise (winner of the National Book Award) and The Silence, a novel that “reflects our era’s nightmares and hallucinations with all appropriate lurid, tawdry shades” (The Cleveland Plain Dealer)<br/><br/>Bucky Wunderlick, rock star and budding messiah, has hit a spiritual wall. Unfulfilled by the excess of fame and fortune his revolutionary image has wrought, he bolts from his band mid-tour to hole up in a dingy East Village apartment and separate himself from the paranoid machine that propels the culture he has helped create. As faithful fans await messages, Bucky encounters every sort of roiling farce he is trying to escape. Great Jones Street is a penetrating look at rock and roll's merger of art, commerce and urban decay.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/70/9780140179170.jpg', 'title_long': 'Great Jones Street (Contemporary American Fiction)', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.7 Inches, Length: 5.08 Inches, Weight: 0.49 Pounds, Width: 0.61 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.08}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.61}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.49}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.7}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '1994-01-01', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Metaphysical & Visionary', 'Psychological', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Psychological Thrillers', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Don DeLillo'], 'title': 'Great Jones Street (Contemporary American Fiction)', 'isbn13': '9780140179170', 'msrp': 11.44, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1101659874'}, 'isbn': '0140179178', 'isbn10': '0140179178', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101659878', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
