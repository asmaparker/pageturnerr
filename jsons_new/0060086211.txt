And now, needing more room, the colony sends scouts into theunknown land beyond. But by venturing forward, the apes are encroaching upon hostile ground -- where creatures dwell that can rip an adult simian to pieces in less than an instant; monstrous reptilians whose incredible savagery isequaled only by their awesome brainpower. To venture into their midst is almost certain doom -- but to remain behind would be suicide. Because another foe is lurking in the shadows: the enemy called Man.
