{'book': {'publisher': 'Dark Horse', 'synopsis': "Museum of Terror volumes one and two introduced readers to the horrific, beautiful creature Tomie... the woman no man could resist. Now Junji Ito, creator and curator of this horrible museum, brings a new type of exhibit to thrill and chill your senses! First, his lovely violinists will escort you to dinner in a vampire den. Next, in a classroom full of grotesquely masked students, which one is a demon in disguise? A musician's possessed arm attacks a schoolgirl by way of his mouth, and another young man listens to the tape recording left behind by a suicide victim. Why did she kill herself, and is he safe from its influence? Swordplay, monk-ridden ruins, halls of upright corpses, infectious radio broadcasts, and murderous ceiling hair are among Ito's beastly offerings in this volume! Find out why Junji Ito is Japan's foremost creator of horror manga!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/99/9781593076399.jpg', 'title_long': 'Museum of Terror, Vol. 3', 'edition': 'First Edition / First Printing', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.80027801106 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.80027801106}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}}, 'pages': 392, 'date_published': '2006-07-26', 'subjects': ['Comics & Graphic Novels', 'Manga', 'Horror', 'Publishers', 'Dark Horse', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy'], 'authors': ['Junji Ito'], 'title': 'Museum of Terror, Vol. 3', 'isbn13': '9781593076399', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1593076398', 'isbn10': '1593076398'}}
