{'book': {'publisher': 'Corgi', 'synopsis': "Naomi had been contentedly and, she thought, happily married for nearly all of her adult life when her husband Edward explained kindly to her one day that he had fallen in love with a twenty-six year old and wanted a divorce. She had to leave the comfortable home she had shared with Edward and their three children, now all grown-up, and move into a small flat in the middle of Bath. The dramatic change in her lifestyle threatened to overwhelm her. But gradually Naomi began to appreciate the changes, and even to enjoy them. For the first time in her life she could do what she liked, and make her own friends. If these included men friends - well, why not? Unfortunately her children could think of many reasons why not, and Naomi began a battle to establish her own independence, and to persuade her family that she had moved into the springtime of a whole new life. In this warm and inspiring new novel, Elvi Rhodes' wonderful storytelling skills are used to explore a dilemma faced by many women today.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/55/9780552146555.jpg', 'title_long': 'Spring Music', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.54895103238 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.54895103238}}, 'pages': 457, 'date_published': '1999', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Elvi Rhodes'], 'title': 'Spring Music', 'isbn13': '9780552146555', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0552146552', 'isbn10': '0552146552'}}
