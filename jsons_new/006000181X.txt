{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "Don't Look Back . . .<br/>Maggie Chantel is running from memories too painful -- and frightening -- to acknowledge. And the small, peaceful town of Blanchefleur on the shores of Lake Michigan is where her running stops. Maggie just wants to be left alone to forget, but her new neighbor Nick Alessandro is paying her far too much attention. A survivor of soul-shattering tragedy, Nick is fascinated by this beautiful, secretive woman -- an interest that is slowly turning from attraction to love.<br/>But someone waiting in the shadows is determined that Maggie will love no one ever again. The nightmare she was escaping has found her hiding place, and people in the sleepy Michigan community are starting to die. Maggie knows what her hunter is capable of, and now she must leave behind the man who was bringing her back to life, for his own safety. Nick is determined never to lose the only person who can make his world whole again. And he knows he has to find the killer -- before the killer gets to Maggie.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/18/10/9780060001810.jpg', 'title_long': 'With Her Last Breath', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-06', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Romantic Suspense', 'New Adult & College'], 'authors': ['Cait London'], 'title': 'With Her Last Breath', 'isbn13': '9780060001810', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061758612'}, 'isbn': '006000181X', 'isbn10': '006000181X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061758614', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
