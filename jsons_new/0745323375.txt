{'book': {'publisher': 'Pluto Press', 'synopsis': "This collection of essays is the first of its kind in English on the work of Antonio Negri, the Italian philosopher and political theorist. The spectacular success of Empire, Negri's collaboration with Michael Hardt, has brought Negri's writing to a new, wider audience. A substantial body of his writing is now available to an English-speaking readership. Outstanding contributors - including Michael Hardt, Sergio Bologna, Kathi Weeks and Nick Dyer-Witheford - reveal the variety and complexity of Negri's thought and explore its unique relevance to modern politics. Negri is one of the most sophisticated analysts of modern political philosophy. Philosophers and critics alike find his work both difficult and exhilarating, engaging as it does with Marx, Spinoza, Deleuze, Guattari, Tronti and others. This book is ideal for readers who want to get to grips with Negri's key themes, in particular his theories on labour, capital, power, the state and revolution. It makes a great introduction to his work for students of political philosophy, as well as providing a comprehensive critical approach for Negri enthusiasts.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/33/74/9780745323374.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Philosophy of Antonio Negri, Volume One: Resistance in Practice', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.12876678144 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.64}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.12876678144}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 280, 'date_published': '2005-05-20', 'subjects': ['Politics & Social Sciences', 'Philosophy', 'Political', 'Politics & Government', 'Ideologies & Doctrines', 'Political Science'], 'authors': [], 'title': 'The Philosophy of Antonio Negri, Volume One: Resistance in Practice', 'isbn13': '9780745323374', 'msrp': 31, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Page Fidelity': '1849642516', 'eBook': '1849642516'}, 'isbn': '0745323375', 'isbn10': '0745323375', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781849642514', 'binding': 'ebook'}]}}
