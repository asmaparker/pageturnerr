{'book': {'publisher': 'Ballantine Books', 'synopsis': 'It is the early 1900s in rural Kentucky, and young Saul Sullivan is heading up to Redbud Camp to look for work. He is wary but unafraid of the Cherokee girl there whose beauty is said to cause the death of all men who see her. But the minute Saul lays eyes on Vine, he knows she is meant to be his wife. Vine’s mother disapproves of the mixed marriage; Saul’s mother, Esme, has always been ill at ease around the Cherokee people. But once Vine walks into God’s Creek, Saul’s mother and brother Aaron take to her immediately. It quickly becomes clear to Vine, though, that Aaron is obsessed with her. And when Saul leaves God’s Creek for a year to work in another county, the wife he leaves behind will never be the same again. The violence that lies ahead for Vine, will not only test her spirit, but also her ability to forgive—both others and herself. . . .', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/72/9780345464972.jpg', 'title_long': "A Parchment of Leaves (Ballantine Reader's Circle)", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.22 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.58 Pounds, Width: 0.66 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.66}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.58}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.22}}, 'pages': 289, 'date_published': '2003-08-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Historical', 'United States', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Silas House'], 'title': "A Parchment of Leaves (Ballantine Reader's Circle)", 'isbn13': '9780345464972', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0345464974', 'isbn10': '0345464974'}}
