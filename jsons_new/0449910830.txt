Knopf', 'synopsis': "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jane Smiley recaptures an almost forgotten part of the American story and once again demonstrates her extraordinary range and brilliance in The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton<br/><br/>Set in the 1850s, The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton speaks to us in a splendidly quirky voice—the strong, wry, no-nonsense voice of Lidie Harkness of Quincy, Illinois, a young woman of courage, good sense, and good heart. It carries us into an America so violently torn apart by the question of slavery that it makes our current political battlegrounds seem a peaceable kingdom.<br/><br/>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW<br/><br/>“Rousing . . . Action-packed . . . A gripping story about love, fortitude, and convictions that are worth fighting for.”—Los Angeles Times<br/><br/>“Powerful . . . Smiley takes us back to Kansas in 1855, a place of rising passions and vast uncertainties. Narrated in the spirited, unsentimental voice of 20-year-old Lidie Newton, the novel is at once an ambitious examination of a turning point in history and the riveting story of one woman's journey into uncharted regions of place and self.”—Chicago Tribune<br/><br/>“[A] grand tale of the moral and political upheavals igniting antebellum frontier life and a heroine so wonderfully fleshed and unforgettable you will think you are listening to her story instead of reading it. Smiley may have snared a Pulitzer for A Thousand Acres . . . but it is with Lydia (Lidie) Harkness Newton that she emphatically captures our hearts. . . . The key word in Smiley's title is Adventures, and Lydia's are crammed with breathless movement, danger, and tension; populated by terrifically entertaining characters and securely grounded in telling detail.”—The Miami Herald<br/><br/>“Smiley brilliantly evokes mid-nineteenth century life. . . . Richly imagined and superbly written, Jane Smiley's new novel is an extraordinary accomplishment in an already distinguished career.”—Atlanta Journal-Constitution<br/><br/>“A sprawling epic . . . A garrulous, nights-by-the-hearth narrative not unlike those classics of the period it emulates. In following a rebellious young woman of 1855 into Kansas Territory and beyond, the novel is so persuasively authentic that it reads like a forgotten document from the days of Twain and Stowe.”—The Boston Sunday Globe", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/32/9780449910832.jpg', 'title_long': "The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)", 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.85 Pounds, Width: 1.04 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.04}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.85}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.98}}, 'pages': 480, 'date_published': '1998-12-29', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Action & Adventure', 'War & Military', "Women's Adventure", 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jane Smiley'], 'title': "The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)", 'isbn13': '9780449910832', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0307416844', 'ePub': '0307416844'}, 'isbn': '0449910830', 'isbn10': '0449910830', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307416841', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
