{'book': {'publisher': 'Dark Horse', 'synopsis': "In Japan, ju-on is a deadly curse that takes on a life of its own. Always seeking new victims, it's a grudge that doesn't stop-it can't be stopped. Anyone unfortunate enough to meet up with a ghost killed by the grudge is then killed-and so it spreads. When a senior citizen outreach volunteer goes to work in a house in a quiet residential area, she soon starts to hear odd noises. As the strange events get more and more ominous, she discovers that some acts of violence can attach themselves to a house and that some evils can reach out and touch you-even after death. Few stories have influenced modern horror as much as Ju-on. The Japanese films set a new standard for horror filmmaking and storytelling with their blend of slow-burning terror and nightmarish imagery. The novel is just as chilling-and just as unforgettable.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/16/9781595820716.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ju-On', 'edition': '1st DH Press Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.55 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.55}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}}, 'pages': 235, 'date_published': '2006-09-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'TV, Movie, Video Game Adaptations'], 'authors': ['Kei Ohishi'], 'title': 'Ju-On', 'isbn13': '9781595820716', 'msrp': 8.62, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '159582071X', 'isbn10': '159582071X'}}
