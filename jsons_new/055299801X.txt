It was the time when he realized that his great passion for dance would never be matched by his talent; the time when he discovered the funny agony of first love' and the time when he watched his brother declining into a cruel, untimely death.<br/><br/>It is only when, twenty-four years later, Walter returns to fight for the survival of his childhood Eden, his family's lakeside summer home, that he finally discovers a way to reconcile himself to the past in a way that gives hope for the future.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/80/17/9780552998017.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Short History of a Prince', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.874 Inches, Length: 5.1181 Inches, Weight: 0.62170357884 Pounds, Width: 0.98425 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.1181}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.98425}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.62170357884}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.874}}, 'pages': 431, 'date_published': '1999', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Jane Hamilton'], 'title': 'The Short History of a Prince', 'isbn13': '9780552998017', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '055299801X', 'isbn10': '055299801X'}}
