Now one of these characters, Major Lord John Grey, opens the door to his own part of this world — eighteenth-century London, a seething anthill of nobility and rabble peopled by soldiers and spies, whores and dukes. Great Britain is battling France for supremacy on three continents — and life is good for a soldier.<br/><br/>The year is 1757. On a clear morning in mid-June, Lord John Grey emerges from London’s Beefsteak Club, his mind in turmoil. A nobleman and a high-ranking officer in His Majesty’s Army, Grey has just witnessed something shocking. But his efforts to avoid a scandal that might destroy his family are interrupted by something still more urgent: the Crown appoints him to investigate the brutal murder of a comrade in arms, who may have been a traitor.<br/><br/>Obliged to pursue two inquiries at once, Major Grey finds himself ensnared in a web of treachery and betrayal that touches every stratum of English society — and threatens all he holds dear. From the bawdy houses of London’s night-world to the stately drawing rooms of the nobility, and from the blood of a murdered corpse to the thundering seas ruled by the majestic fleet of the East India Company, Lord John pursues the elusive trails of a vanishing footman and a woman in green velvet, who may hold the key to everything — or nothing.<br/><br/>The early days of the Seven Years War come brilliantly to life in this historical mystery by an author whose unique and compelling storytelling has engrossed millions of readers worldwide.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/54/9780770429454.jpg', 'title_long': 'Lord John and the Private Matter (Lord John Grey)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 4.17 Inches, Length: 6.89 Inches, Weight: 0.5 Pounds, Width: 1.07 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.89}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.07}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.17}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2005-10-04', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Diana Gabaldon'], 'title': 'Lord John and the Private Matter (Lord John Grey)', 'isbn13': '9780770429454', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0770429459', 'isbn10': '0770429459'}}
