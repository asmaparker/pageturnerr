With a fluency of tone that will surprise even his devoted readers, he captures both bewildering horror and heartrending tenderness with an absorbing, compassionate authority.<br/><br/>We warm to these newcomers—as to all Russo's characters—almost despite ourselves. A jaded Hollywood moviemaker uncovers a decades-old flame he never knew he'd harbored. A precocious fifth grader puzzles over life, love and baseball as he watches his parents' marriage dissolve. Another child is forced into a harrowing cross-country escape whose actual purpose he learns only after the fact. An elderly couple rediscovers the power, and the misery, of their relationship during a long-awaited retreat to a resort island. And in the title story, a septuagenarian nun invades the narrator's college writing workshop with an incredible saga.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/29/9780099437529.jpg', 'title_long': "The Whore's Child : And Other Stories", 'edition': 'First Vintage Contemporaries Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.79526 Inches, Length: 5.07873 Inches, Weight: 0.37699046802 Pounds, Width: 0.59055 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.07873}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.59055}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.37699046802}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.79526}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Short Stories & Anthologies', 'Short Stories', 'Literary'], 'authors': ['Richard Russo'], 'title': "The Whore's Child : And Other Stories", 'isbn13': '9780099437529', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '009943752X', 'isbn10': '009943752X'}}
