Everything important happens near it, through it, or beyond it. The world for this little girl will soon grow larger and more complex, but never more enchanting or deeply felt. Her story is both a voyage of discovery and a celebration of the commonplace wonders that define childhood, expressed as a joyful fusion of text with evocative and exuberant art that garnered the highest honor in children's book illustration in 2006.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/41/9780786809141.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Hello, Goodbye Window', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 11.25 Inches, Length: 10.375 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.375 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10.375}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.375}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.25}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '2005-04-26', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Activities, Crafts & Games', 'Activity Books', 'Reference', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Norton Juster'], 'title': 'The Hello, Goodbye Window', 'isbn13': '9780786809141', 'msrp': 18.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0786809140', 'isbn10': '0786809140'}}
