{'book': {'publisher': 'Association for Scottish Literary Studies', 'synopsis': "Iain Banks was one of Scotland's most inventive writers, producing an extraordinary range of work, from family sagas set in present-day Scotland to science fiction spanning vast gulfs of space and time. He enjoyed breaking the arbitrary boundaries of genre, and often created narratives blending “realistic” storylines with fantastical elements.<br/><br/>Alan MacGillivray’s Scotnote provides an overview of Iain Banks’s fiction, and focuses on three novels in particular: The Wasp Factory, a darkly comic piece of Scottish Gothic fiction; The Crow Road, a cross-generational family saga with elements of a detective story; and Whit, following the adventures of an innocent thrust into modern society. Suitable for senior school pupils and students at all levels.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/74/83/9780948877483.jpg', 'title_long': 'Three Novels of Iain Banks: "Whit", "The Crow Road" and "The Wasp Factory" (Scotnotes)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.2677 Inches, Length: 5.82676 Inches, Weight: 0.26235009178 Pounds, Width: 0.19685 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.82676}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.19685}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.26235009178}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2677}}, 'pages': 80, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Instruction Methods'], 'authors': ['A.
