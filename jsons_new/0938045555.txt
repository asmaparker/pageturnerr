From the ancient days of Greek wrestling, to the jealously guarded secrets of Chinese Kung Fu masters, to the hard men of modern spec ops, warriors and allied strongmen have developed an amazing array of skills for generating inhuman strength.But these skills have been scattered far and wide, held closely secret, or communicated in a piecemeal fashion that has left most of us frustrated and far from reaching our true strength potential.Now, for the first time, Russian strength expert and former Spetsnaz instructor Pavel has gathered many of these devastating techniques into one highly teachable skill set. In The Naked Warrior Pavel reveals exactly what it takes to be super-strong in minimum time-when your body is your only tool.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/57/9780938045557.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Perfect Business Audio CD', 'edition': 'First', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.000625 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.000625}}, 'pages': 218, 'date_published': '2001', 'subjects': ['Business & Money', 'Investing', 'Introduction'], 'authors': ['Robert T.
