{'book': {'publisher': 'Delacorte Press', 'synopsis': 'From Atlanta’s wealthiest suburbs to its stark inner-city housing projects, a killer has crossed the boundaries of wealth and race. And the people who are chasing him must cross those boundaries, too. Among them is Michael Ormewood, a veteran detective whose marriage is hanging by a thread—and whose arrogance and explosive temper are threatening his career. And Angie Polaski, a beautiful vice cop who was once Michael’s lover before she became his enemy. But unbeknownst to both of them, another player has entered the game: a loser ex-con who has stumbled upon the killer’s trail in the most coincidental of ways—and who may be the key to breaking the case wide open.<br/><br/>In this gritty, gripping firecracker of a novel, the author of the bestselling Grant County, Georgia, series breaks thrilling new ground, weaving together the threads of a complex, multilayered story with the skill of a master craftsman. Packed with body-bending switchbacks, searing psychological suspense and human emotions, Triptych ratchets up the tension one revelation at a time as it races to a shattering and unforgettable climax.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/94/69/9780385339469.jpg', 'title_long': 'Triptych', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.45 Pounds, Width: 1.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2006-08-16', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Karin Slaughter'], 'title': 'Triptych', 'isbn13': '9780385339469', 'msrp': 25, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0440336236', 'ePub': '0440336236'}, 'isbn': '0385339461', 'isbn10': '0385339461', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780440336235', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
