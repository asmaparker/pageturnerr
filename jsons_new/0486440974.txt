Nearly 400 quotations include such thought-provoking and memorable remarks as:<br/>Bad promises are better broken than kept.<br/>Marriage is neither heaven nor hell; it is simply purgatory.<br/>Whenever I hear anyone arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.<br/>Quotations are arranged chronologically within such topics as family and friends, the law, politics and the presidency, story-telling, religion, and morality. Students, writers, public speakers, and other readers will find this thought-provoking and entertaining volume an excellent introduction to the sixteenth president’s wit, common sense, and insight.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/09/72/9780486440972.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Wit and Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln: A Book of Quotations (Dover Thrift Editions: Speeches/Quotations)', 'edition': 'F First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.25 Inches, Weight: 0.18077905484 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.18077905484}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 90, 'date_published': '2005-08-08', 'subjects': ['Humor & Entertainment', 'Humor', 'Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Anthologies', 'Reference', 'Quotations', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Abraham Lincoln'], 'title': 'The Wit and Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln: A Book of Quotations (Dover Thrift Editions: Speeches/Quotations)', 'isbn13': '9780486440972', 'msrp': 3, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0486110745'}, 'isbn': '0486440974', 'isbn10': '0486440974', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780486110745', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
