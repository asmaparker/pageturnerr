{'book': {'publisher': 'Grove Press', 'synopsis': 'Rock ’n’ Roll is an electrifying collision of the romantic and the revolutionary. It is 1968 and the world is ablaze with rebellion, accompanied by a sound track of the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. Clutching his prized collection of rock albums, Jan, a Cambridge graduate student, returns to his homeland of Czechoslovakia just as Soviet tanks roll into Prague. When security forces tighten their grip on artistic expression, Jan is inexorably drawn toward a dangerous act of dissent. Back in England, Jan’s volcanic mentor, Max, faces a war of his own as his free-spirited daughter and his cancer-stricken wife attempt to break through his walls of academic and emotional obstinacy. Over the next twenty years of love, espionage, chance, and loss, the extraordinary lives of Jan and Max spin and intersect until an unexpected reunion forces them to see what is truly worth the fight.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/30/75/9780802143075.jpg', 'title_long': "Rock 'n' Roll: A New Play", 'edition': '1st U.S. Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.75 Inches, Length: 5 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.25 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.25}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.75}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '2007-05-10', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Theater', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Dramas & Plays', 'British & Irish', 'Reference', 'Writing, Research & Publishing Guides', 'Writing'], 'authors': ['Tom Stoppard'], 'title': "Rock 'n' Roll: A New Play", 'isbn13': '9780802143075', 'msrp': 14, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0802143075', 'isbn10': '0802143075', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780802195364', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
