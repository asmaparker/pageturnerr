{'book': {'publisher': "G.P. Putnam's Sons", 'synopsis': 'Free Play is about the inner sources of spontaneous creation. It is about why we create and what we learn when we do. It is about the flow of unhindered creative energy: the joy of making art in all its varied forms.<br/><br/>An international bestseller and beloved classic, Free Play is an inspiring and provocative book, directed toward people in any field who want to contact, honor, and strengthen their own creative powers. It reveals how inspiration arises within us, how that inspiration may be blocked, derailed or obscured, and how finally it can be liberated—how we can be liberated—to speak or sing, write or paint, dance or play, with our own authentic voice.<br/><br/>Stephen Nachmanovitch, a pioneer in free improvisation, integrates material from a wide variety of sources among the arts, sciences, and spiritual traditions of humanity, drawing on unusual quotes, amusing and illuminating anecdotes, and original metaphors. The whole enterprise of improvisation in life and art, of recovering free play and awakening creativity, is about being true to ourselves and our visions. Free Play brings us into direct, active contact with boundless creative energies that we may not even know we had.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/63/17/9780874776317.jpg', 'title_long': 'Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.99 Inches, Length: 5.05 Inches, Weight: 0.41 Pounds, Width: 0.59 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.05}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.59}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.41}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.99}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '1991-05-01', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Creativity', 'Happiness', 'Motivational', 'Humor & Entertainment', 'Movies', 'Direction & Production', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Creativity & Genius', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'New Age & Spirituality', 'Worship & Devotion', 'Inspirational', 'Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cognitive Psychology'], 'authors': ['Stephen Nachmanovitch'], 'title': 'Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art', 'isbn13': '9780874776317', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '144067308X', 'eBook': '1608686167', 'ePub': '144067308X'}, 'isbn': '0874776317', 'isbn10': '0874776317', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781440673085', 'binding': 'print'}, {'isbn': '9781608686162', 'binding': 'ebook'}]}}
