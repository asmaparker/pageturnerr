{'book': {'publisher': 'Times Books', 'synopsis': 'President Nixon\'s former counsel illuminates another presidency marked by scandal<br/><br/>Warren G. Harding may be best known as America\'s worst president. Scandals plagued him: the Teapot Dome affair, corruption in the Veterans Bureau and the Justice Department, and the posthumous revelation of an extramarital affair.<br/><br/>Raised in Marion, Ohio, Harding took hold of the small town\'s newspaper and turned it into a success. Showing a talent for local politics, he rose quickly to the U.S. Senate. His presidential campaign slogan, "America\'s present need is not heroics but healing, not nostrums but normalcy," gave voice to a public exhausted by the intense politics following World War I. Once elected, he pushed for legislation limiting the number of immigrants; set high tariffs to relieve the farm crisis after the war; persuaded Congress to adopt unified federal budget creation; and reduced income taxes and the national debt, before dying unexpectedly in 1923.<br/><br/>In this wise and compelling biography, John W. Dean―no stranger to controversy himself―recovers the truths and explodes the myths surrounding our twenty-ninth president\'s tarnished legacy.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/95/63/9780805069563.jpg', 'title_long': 'Warren G.
