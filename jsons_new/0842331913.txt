{'book': {'publisher': 'Living Books', 'synopsis': "They discovered the love of God at Chautauqua. If only their wayward children might do the same! For four lifelong friends, memories of a certain summer at Chautauqua remain fresh in their minds, though they have long since married and raised their families. They have often dreamed of returning, but responsibilities of life have prevented them. Now, at last, their dream is coming true, and the four invite their families to join them.<br/><br/>For these mothers, Chautauqua represents a legacy of faith. For two of their children, however, it represents far less. Burnham Roberts, handsome and distinguished, lacks his parents' godly character; and wild, independent Eureka Harrison believes in nothing. For them, a summer at the famed resort is no more than an opportunity for fun and games. But what they find at Chautauqua may not be what they expect―or it may just be more than they could hope for!<br/><br/>Heartwarming stories of faith and love by Grace Livingston Hill's aunt―Isabella Alden. Each book is similar in style and tone to Hill's and is set in the late 1800s and early 1900s.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19/13/9780842331913.jpg', 'title_long': 'Four Mothers at Chautauqua (GLH Library)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 4.5 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}}, 'pages': 265, 'date_published': '1997-04-30', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Isabella Alden'], 'title': 'Four Mothers at Chautauqua (GLH Library)', 'isbn13': '9780842331913', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0842331913', 'isbn10': '0842331913'}}
