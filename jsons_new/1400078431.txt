She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later—the night before New Year’s Eve—the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John Gregory Dunne suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of forty years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LAX, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Center to relieve a massive hematoma.<br/><br/>This powerful book is Didion’ s attempt to make sense of the “weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness ... about marriage and children and memory ... about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/84/31/9781400078431.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Year of Magical Thinking', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.99 Inches, Length: 5.14 Inches, Weight: 0.46958461806 Pounds, Width: 0.64 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.64}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.46958461806}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.99}}, 'pages': 227, 'date_published': '2007-02-13', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Death & Grief', 'Relationships', 'Love & Loss', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Authors', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Memoirs', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Joan Didion'], 'title': 'The Year of Magical Thinking', 'isbn13': '9781400078431', 'msrp': 11.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0307279723'}, 'isbn': '1400078431', 'isbn10': '1400078431', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780307279729', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
