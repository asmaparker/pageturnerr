{'book': {'publisher': 'Fawcett', 'synopsis': "He was a young American rabbi. She was his beautiful Christian wife. Together they tried to forge a life . . .<br/><br/>“This big, ambitious novel comes as close to matters of faith and life as any book that has appeared. . . . Excellent.”—New York Post<br/><br/>First and foremost, Michael Kind was a man—a courageous man with strong ideals and feelings, a family man devoted to his two children, a passionate man deeply in love with his wife Leslie. He'd already become a rabbi when he met Leslie, a minister's daughter. She fell in love with Michael and converted to Judaism to marry him.<br/><br/>This is their story, a sweeping drama of love and identity, of compassion and cruelty, a searing tale of one man and one woman who must learn to cope with the complications of an unorthodox life in a world that will not accept them, in a world where rabbis and non-Jews do not fall in love—let alone marry . . .<br/><br/>“A human and enlightening portrait of a rabbi as a man, called upon constantly to be something more than a man: of a rabbi as a husband and father with the weakness and problems of other men . . . A rewarding reading experience.”—Los Angeles Times", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/41/9780449214541.jpg', 'title_long': 'Rabbi: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.85 Inches, Length: 4.15 Inches, Weight: 0.48 Pounds, Width: 0.94 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.15}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.94}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.48}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.85}}, 'pages': 448, 'date_published': '1987-08-12', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Saga', 'Psychological', 'World Literature', 'Jewish', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Mystery', 'Romance'], 'authors': ['Noah Gordon'], 'title': 'Rabbi: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780449214541', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0449214540', 'isbn10': '0449214540'}}
