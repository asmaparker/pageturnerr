{'book': {'publisher': 'Vintage', 'synopsis': 'With his first novel since the internationally acclaimed The English Patient, Booker Prize—winning author Michael Ondaatje gives us a work displaying all the richness of imagery and language and the piercing emotional truth that we have come to know as the hallmarks of his writing.<br/><br/>Anil’s Ghost transports us to Sri Lanka, a country steeped in centuries of tradition, now forced into the late twentieth century by the ravages of civil war. Into this maelstrom steps Anil Tissera, a young woman born in Sri Lanka, educated in England and America, who returns to her homeland as a forensic anthropologist sent by an international human rights group to discover the source of the organized campaigns of murder engulfing the island. What follows is a story about love, about family, about identity, about the unknown enemy, about the quest to unlock the hidden past–a story propelled by a riveting mystery. Unfolding against the deeply evocative background of Sri Lanka’s landscape and ancient civilization, Anil’s Ghost is a literary spellbinder–Michael Ondaatje’s most powerful novel yet.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/43/74/9780375724374.jpg', 'title_long': "Anil's Ghost: A Novel", 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.97 Inches, Length: 5.2 Inches, Weight: 0.575 Pounds, Width: 0.67 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.2}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.67}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.575}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.97}}, 'pages': 307, 'date_published': '2001-04-24', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'Psychological', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Michael Ondaatje'], 'title': "Anil's Ghost: A Novel", 'isbn13': '9780375724374', 'msrp': 15.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0375412670'}, 'isbn': '0375724370', 'isbn10': '0375724370', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780375412677', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
