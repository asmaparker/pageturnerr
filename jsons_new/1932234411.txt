{'book': {'publisher': 'Vertical', 'synopsis': "The Inspiration for the New Major Motion Picture RINGS<br/><br/>A mysterious videotape warns that the viewer will die in one week unless a certain, unspecified act is performed. Exactly one week after watching the tape, four teenagers die one after another of heart failure.<br/><br/>Asakawa, a hardworking journalist, is intrigued by his niece's inexplicable death. His investigation leads him from a metropolitan tokyo teeming with modern society's fears to a rural Japan—a mountain resort, a volcanic island, and a countryside clinic—haunted by the past. His attempt to solve the tape's mystery before it's too late—for everyone—assumes an increasingly deadly urgency. Ring is a chillingly told horror story, a masterfully suspenseful mystery, and post-modern trip.<br/><br/>The success of Koji Suzuki's novel the Ring has lead to manga, television and film adaptations in Japan, Korea, and the U.S.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/11/9781932234411.jpg', 'title_long': 'Ring (Ring Series, Book 1)', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.98 Inches, Length: 5.17 Inches, Weight: 0.76 Pounds, Width: 0.78 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.17}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.78}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.76}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.98}}, 'pages': 282, 'date_published': '2004-04-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Horror', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Supernatural'], 'authors': ['Koji Suzuki'], 'title': 'Ring (Ring Series, Book 1)', 'isbn13': '9781932234411', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '1932234411', 'isbn10': '1932234411'}}
