{'book': {'publisher': 'Crossroad', 'synopsis': 'Henri Nouwen was a spiritual thinker with an unusual capacity to write about the life of Jesus and the love of God in ways that have inspired countless people to trust life more fully. Most widely read among the over 40 books Father Nouwen wrote is In the Name of Jesus. For a society that measures successful leadership in terms of the effectiveness of the individual, Father Nouwen offers a counter definition that is witnessed by a "communal and mutual experience." For Nouwen, leadership cannot function apart from the community. His wisdom is grounded in the foundation that we are a people "called." This beautiful guide to Christian Leadership is the rich fruit of Henri Nouwen\'s own journey as one of the most influential spiritual leaders of the 20th century.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/90/9780824512590.jpg', 'title_long': 'In the Name of Jesus: Reflections on Christian Leadership', 'edition': '32117th', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 5.125 Inches, Weight: 0.34 Pounds, Width: 0.4 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.4}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.34}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 120, 'date_published': '1992-10-01', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Christian Living', 'Churches & Church Leadership', 'Church Leadership', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Religion & Spirituality'], 'authors': ['Henri J.
