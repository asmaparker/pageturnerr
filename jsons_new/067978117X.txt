This brilliantly insightful, morally devastating book tells us why he believed, how he lost faith, and what his deceptions cost five of the war\'s witnesses and McNamara himself.<br/><br/>In The Living and the Dead, Paul Hendrickson juxtaposes McNamara\'s story with those of a wounded Marine, an Army nurse, a Vietnamese refugee, a Quaker who burned himself to death to protest the war, and an enraged artist who tried to kill the man he saw as the war\'s architect. The result is a book whose exhaustive research and imaginative power turn history into an act of reckoning, damning and profoundly sympathetic, impossible to put down and impossible to forget.<br/><br/>"A masterpiece. . . . [Hendrickson] has a gift with language that most writers can only dream about.
