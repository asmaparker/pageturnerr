{'book': {'publisher': 'Laurel Leaf', 'synopsis': "From the author of Anne of Green Gables, the first book of the beloved Emily trilogy—recently seen on Netflix’s hit show Russian Doll!<br/><br/>Emily Starr never knew what it was to be lonely—until her beloved father died. Now Emily's an orphan, and her snobbish relatives are taking her to live with them at New Moon Farm. Although she's sure she'll never be happy there, Emily deals with her stern aunt Elizabeth and her malicious classmates by using her quick wit and holding her head high.<br/><br/>In this first volume of the celebrated Emily trilogy, Lucy Maud Montgomery draws a more realistic portrait of a young orphan girl's life on early twentieth-century Prince Edward Island. Along with Emily Climbs and Emily’s Quest, Emily of New Moon insightfully portrays the beauty and anguish of growing up.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/04/9780553233704.jpg', 'title_long': 'Emily of New Moon (The Emily Books, Book 1)', 'edition': 'First Laurel-Leaf Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.87 Inches, Length: 4.14 Inches, Weight: 0.38360433588 Pounds, Width: 0.88 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.14}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.88}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.38360433588}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.87}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '1983-05-01', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics', 'Social & Family Issues', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Lucy Maud Montgomery'], 'title': 'Emily of New Moon (The Emily Books, Book 1)', 'isbn13': '9780553233704', 'msrp': 17.95, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '055323370X', 'isbn10': '055323370X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781952438479', 'binding': 'print'}, {'isbn': '9781974939213', 'binding': 'printisbncanonical'}]}}
