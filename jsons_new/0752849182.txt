{'book': {'publisher': 'Orion', 'synopsis': "Myron Bolitar is a fascinating character--a guy in his 30s who just moved into his own New York apartment, and who still looks forward to dinner with his parents in New Jersey. A former pro-basketball star and Harvard Law School grad, he now runs his own sports agency, and also dabbles in the private investigation business. He is helped (and sometimes hindered) by his rich, blond, preppy friend Windsor Horne Lockwood III. Win has some awesome lethal powers hidden under his Brooks Brothers suits!<br/><br/>In The Final Detail Win and Myron are looking into the murder of a client--a troubled New York Yankees baseball player called Clu Haid. Clu was apparently shot to death by Esperanza Diaz, who just happens to be Myron's best friend and partner in the sport's agency. Esperanza is hiding something, but Myron isn't sure if it has to do with her job, or with her private life. His search for the truth takes him back to a shabby incident from his own past, and to times he would rather forget. Author Harlan Coben casually drops in dozens of poignant moments of humanity that keep us--and Myron--firmly grounded in reality.<br/><br/>Other books in this excellent series include Backspin, Deal Breaker, Drop Shot, and One False Move. --Dick Adler", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/91/88/9780752849188.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Final Detail', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.96849 Inches, Length: 4.3307 Inches, Weight: 1.10231131 Pounds, Width: 0.82677 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.3307}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.82677}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.10231131}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.96849}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2007', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thrillers & Suspense'], 'authors': ['Harlan Coben'], 'title': 'The Final Detail', 'isbn13': '9780752849188', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0752849182', 'isbn10': '0752849182'}}
