Lonely, guilt-ridden, and prone to visions of the future that have an uncomfortable habit of coming true, Gemma's reception there is a chilly one. To make things worse, she's being followed by a mysterious young Indian man, a man sent to watch her. But why? What is her destiny? And what will her entanglement with Spence's most powerful girls - and their foray into the spiritual world - lead to?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/53/42/9780689875342.jpg', 'title_long': 'A Great and Terrible Beauty', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'pages': 416, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Teen & Young Adult'], 'authors': ['Libba Bray'], 'title': 'A Great and Terrible Beauty', 'isbn13': '9780689875342', 'msrp': '0.00', 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0689875347', 'isbn10': '0689875347'}}
