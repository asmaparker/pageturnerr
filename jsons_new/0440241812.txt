And this time Becky Bloomwood and her credit cards are headed across the Atlantic.…<br/><br/>With her shopping excesses (somewhat) in check and her career as a TV financial guru thriving, Becky’s biggest problem seems to be tearing her entrepreneur boyfriend, Luke, away from work for a romantic country weekend.
