{'book': {'publisher': 'Random House Value Publishing', 'synopsis': 'Following All the Pretty Horses in Cormac McCarthy\'s Border Trilogy is a novel whose force of language is matched only by its breadth of experience and depth of thought.<br><br>In the bootheel of New Mexico hard on the frontier, Billy and Boyd Parham are just boys in the years before the Second World War, but on the cusp of unimaginable events. First comes a trespassing Indian and the dream of wolves running wild amongst the cattle lately brought onto the plain by settlers -- this when all the wisdom of trappers has disappeared along with the trappers themselves. And so Billy sets forth at the age of sixteen on an unwitting journey into the souls of boys and animals and men. Having trapped a she-wolf he would restore to the mountains of Mexico, he is long gone and returns to find everything he left behind transformed utterly in his absence. Except his kid brother, Boyd, with whom he strikes out yet again to reclaim what is theirs thus crossing into "that antique gaze from whence there could be no way back forever."<br><br>An essential novel by any measure, The Crossing is luminous and appalling, a book that touches, stops, and starts the heart and mind at once.<br><br><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/89/50/9780517168950.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Crossing', 'dimensions': 'weight: 636 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 636}}, 'pages': 425, 'date_published': '1996', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary'], 'authors': ['Cormac McCarthy'], 'title': 'The Crossing', 'isbn13': '9780517168950', 'msrp': 5.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0517168952', 'isbn10': '0517168952'}}
