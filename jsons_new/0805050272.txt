In Killing Rage, one of our premier cultural and social critics brings the Black feminist’s voice to bear on this country’s public discourse on race, redressing the historical shunting of women’s writing in this sphere to the side. In incisive essays, hooks addresses the wide spectrum of topics dealing with race and racism in the United States: friendship between Black women and white women; psychological trauma among African Americans; and internalized racism in movies and the media. hooks tackles the bitter difficulties of racism by envisioning a world without it, sharing a vision where “killing rage”―the fierce anger of Black people stung by repeated instances of everyday racism―offers not only a wellspring of love and strength, but also a realistic catalyst for positive change.<br/>This seminal book is one Americans need today if we’re to remain united tomorrow.<br/>“An angry book that pulls no punches…. Her frankness and willingness to face up to the divisive issues that refuse to go away make her a voice to be reckoned with in the debate on race in America.” ―The New York Review of Books', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/71/9780805050271.jpg', 'title_long': 'Killing Rage', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.2901409 Inches, Length: 5.59 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.8200771 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.59}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8200771}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.2901409}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '1996', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Ethnic & National', 'African-American & Black', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Specific Demographics', "Women's Studies", 'Feminist Theory', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'Sociology', 'Race Relations'], 'authors': ['bell hooks'], 'title': 'Killing Rage', 'isbn13': '9780805050271', 'msrp': 13.52, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0805050272', 'isbn10': '0805050272'}}
