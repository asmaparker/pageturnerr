{'book': {'publisher': 'Washington Square Press', 'synopsis': "New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Weiner’s unforgettable story of adjusting to suburbia—and all the surprises hidden behind its doors.<br/><br/>For Kate Klein, a semi-accidental mother of three, suburbia has been full of unpleasant surprises. Her once-loving husband is hardly ever home. The supermommies on the playground routinely snub her. Her days are spent carpooling and enduring endless games of Candy Land, and at night, most of her orgasms are of the do-it-yourself variety.<br/><br/>When a fellow mother is murdered, Kate finds that the unsolved mystery is the most exciting thing to happen in Upchurch, Connecticut, since her neighbors broke ground for a guesthouse and cracked their septic tank. Even though the local police chief warns her that crime-fighting's a job best left to the professionals, Kate launches an unofficial investigation -- from 8:45 to 11:30 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, when her kids are in nursery school.<br/><br/>As Kate is drawn deeper into the murdered woman's past, she begins to uncover the secrets and lies behind Upchurch's picket-fence facade -- and considers the choices and compromises all modern women make as they navigate between marriage and independence, small towns and big cities, being a mother and having a life of one's own.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/24/9780743470124.jpg', 'title_long': 'Goodnight Nobody: A Novel', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.78 Pounds, Width: 1 inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.78}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 400, 'date_published': '2006-05-02', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Mothers & Children', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Literary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Crime', 'Domestic', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Jennifer Weiner'], 'title': 'Goodnight Nobody: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780743470124', 'msrp': 17, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '1416516018'}, 'isbn': '0743470125', 'isbn10': '0743470125', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781416516019', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}
