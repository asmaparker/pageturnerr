But their newest clients have come from the Far East to ask for Cabrillo's special brand of assistance: a consortium of Japanese shipping magnates whose fortunes are being threatened by brutal pirates trolling the waters of Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Normally, such attacks on the high seas are limited to smaller ships and foreign-owned yachts-easy targets on the open ocean. Now, however, giant commercial freighters are disappearing. But when Cabrillo confronts the enemy, he learns that the pirates' predations hide a deadly international conspiracy-a scheme of death and slavery that Juan Cabrillo is going to blow out of the water.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/55/94/9780425205594.jpg', 'title_long': 'Death Watch - 1st Edition/1st Printing', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.01 Inches, Length: 6.02 Inches, Weight: 0.88 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.02}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.88}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.01}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2005', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Sea Stories', 'Action & Adventure', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Sea Adventures', 'War & Military', 'United States', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense'], 'authors': ['Clive Cussler'], 'title': 'Death Watch - 1st Edition/1st Printing', 'isbn13': '9780425205594', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '1101205199', 'ePub': '1101205199'}, 'isbn': '0425205592', 'isbn10': '0425205592', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9781101205198', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
