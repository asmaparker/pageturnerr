{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "Long ago and far away . . .<br/>There was a castle. But not just any castle. This was a castle that glittered and sparkled and rose majestically above the banks of the winding Winono River: the Castle Corona.<br/>And in this castle lived a family. But not just any family. This was the family of King Guido: rich and royal and . . . spoiled. And King Guido was so spoiled that neither jewels nor gold nor splendid finery could please him, for what he longed for most was . . . a nap and a gown that didn't itch.<br/>Far below this grand, glittering castle lived two peasants. But not just any peasants. These peasants, though poor and pitiful, were plucky and proud. And in possession of a stolen pouch. But not just any pouch. A pouch whose very contents had the power to unlock secrets and transform lives . . .<br/>And oh, there is an author. But not just any author. Sharon Creech is a Newbery Medal-winning author whose tantalizing tale will not only dazzle and delight but also entertain and excite.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/62/13/9780060846213.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Castle Corona', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.75 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.44 Pounds, Width: 1.45 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.45}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.44}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2007-10-02', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fairy Tales, Folk Tales & Myths', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Royalty', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Sharon Creech'], 'title': 'The Castle Corona', 'isbn13': '9780060846213', 'msrp': 18.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060846216', 'isbn10': '0060846216'}}
