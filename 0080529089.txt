{'book': {'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'synopsis': 'How do you keep track of basic information on the proteins you work with? Where do you find details of their physicochemical properties, amino acid sequences, gene organization? Are you tired of scanning review articles, primary papers and databases to locate that elusive fact? <br><b>The Academic Press FactsBook</b> series will satisfy scientists and clinical researchers suffering from information overload. Each volume provides a catalog of the essential properties of families of molecules. Gene organization, amino acid sequences, physicochemical properties, and biological activity are presented using a common, easy-to-follow format. Taken together they compile everything you want to know about proteins but are too busy to look for. <b>The Chemokine FactsBook</b> contains more than 40 entries on chemokines, and chemokine receptors from human or other origin, including IL-8, MCP-1, C5-a, RANTES, Lymphotactin, and CC CKR-1. <br>The text provides information on tissue sources, target cells, physicochemical properties, transcription factors, regulation of expression in disease, receptor-binding characteristics, gene structure and location, amino acid sequences, and accession numbers and references.<br><br>Key Features<br>* Contains over 40 entries on chemokines and chemokine receptors from human or other origin, including:<br>* IL-8<br>* MCP-1<br>* C5-a<br>* RANTES<br>* Lymphotactin<br>* CC CKR-1<br>Entries provide information on:<br>* Tissue sources<br>* Target cells<br>* Physicochemical properties<br>* Transcription factors<br>* Regulation of expression<br>* Expression in disease<br>* Receptor-binding characteristics<br>* Gene structure and location<br>* Amino acid sequences<br>* Database accession numbers<br>* References', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/90/80/9780080529080.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Chemokine Factsbook: Ligands and Receptors', 'edition': '1st', 'dimensions': 'ePub', 'pages': 205, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Biology', 'Cell Biology', 'General', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry', 'Allied Health & Medical -> Medical -> Immunology', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Life Sciences General', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> General', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Molecular & Cell Biology', '941', '090', 'Biological Sciences & Nutrition -> Biology -> Biochemistry'], 'authors': ['Krishna Vaddi', 'Margaret Keller', 'Matthew Newton'], 'title': 'The Chemokine Factsbook: Ligands and Receptors', 'isbn13': '9780080529080', 'msrp': 104.99, 'binding': 'Kindle Edition', 'related': {'Paperback': '0127099050'}, 'isbn': '0080529089', 'isbn10': '0080529089', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780127099057', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
