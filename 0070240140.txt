It follows the techniques perfected at the world-famous Annapolis Sailing School, where thousands of people just like you have learned to take tiller in hand and harness the wind. You'll learn your way around a boat--what its parts are called, what they do, and how to use them to ride the wind wherever you want to go.<br/>Read this book, spend some time on a boat, and practice your new skills, and pretty soon you'll be a sailor, one of a select group of people who think there's nothing finer than hiking out to windward in a close-hauled dinghy--racing against friends or a neighboring sailing club, or alone and just for the fun of it.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/01/48/9780070240148.jpg', 'title_long': 'Learning to Sail: The Annapolis Sailing School Guide for All Ages', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.1 Inches, Length: 7.3 Inches, Weight: 0.46958461806 Pounds, Width: 0.3 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.3}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.46958461806}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.1}}, 'pages': 104, 'date_published': '1994-04-22', 'subjects': ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Water Sports', 'Boating', 'Sailing', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Di Goodman', 'Ian Brodie'], 'title': 'Learning to Sail: The Annapolis Sailing School Guide for All Ages', 'isbn13': '9780070240148', 'msrp': 16, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0070240140', 'isbn10': '0070240140'}}
