{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "All antiques dealer Abigail Timberlake Washburn wanted was to find a perfect gift for her darling (if not altogether together) mama Mozella's birthday. She never expected her online purchase of an exquisite, seventeenth-century rosewood linen chest to place her in federal custody, accused of trafficking in illegal ivory! Then insult is heaped on her injury when she's forced to turn to her lawyer-snake ex, Buford, to spring her—since ex-cop /current hubby Greg's “good ol' boy” contacts don't happen to include any feds.<br/>Abby may be small in stature, but she's a force to be reckoned with when riled—and she's determined to root out the real smugglers who she blames for her recent indignities. But in her zeal to stick it to the elephant eliminators who have invaded her beloved Charleston, Abby might just land herself and mama alike up to their pearly whites in lethally hot water!", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/66/02/9780060846602.jpg', 'title_long': 'Poison Ivory (Den of Antiquity, 2)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.33 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.33}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2009-05-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Tamar Myers'], 'title': 'Poison Ivory (Den of Antiquity, 2)', 'isbn13': '9780060846602', 'msrp': 7.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061878413'}, 'isbn': '0060846607', 'isbn10': '0060846607', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061878411', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
