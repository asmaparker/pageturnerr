{'book': {'publisher': 'Henry Holt & Co', 'synopsis': "Celia's House, filled with effervescent warmth and cheer, is the story of Dunnian -- a spellbindingly lovely family estate in Scottish Border country -- and of the generations of Dunne family that live in it and love it dearly. Beginning in 1905 with ninety-year-old Celia Dunne, it delightfully portrays the bustling life of her heir and grand-nephew, Humphrey Dunne, and his family of five rambunctious children. It follows the family over forty years -- through their youthful antics, merry parties, heartbreaks and loves and marriages, as each in turn comes to maturity and an understanding of the enduring satisfaction Dunnian gives to their lives.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/44/18/9780030204418.jpg', 'title_long': "Celia's House", 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.9 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}}, 'pages': 255, 'date_published': '1977', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction'], 'authors': ['D.
