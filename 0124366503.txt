{'book': {'publisher': 'Elsevier Science', 'synopsis': 'In this book, we study theoretical and practical aspects of computing methods for mathematical modelling of nonlinear systems. A number of computing techniques are considered, such as methods of operator approximation with any given accuracy; operator interpolation techniques including a non-Lagrange interpolation; methods of system representation subject to constraints associated with concepts of causality, memory and stationarity; methods of system representation with an accuracy that is the best within a given class of models; methods of covariance matrix estimation;<br/>methods for low-rank matrix approximations; hybrid methods based on a combination of iterative procedures and best operator approximation; and<br/>methods for information compression and filtering under condition that a filter model should satisfy restrictions associated with causality and different types of memory.<br/><br/>As a result, the book represents a blend of new methods in general computational analysis,<br/>and specific, but also generic, techniques for study of systems theory ant its particular<br/>branches, such as optimal filtering and information compression.<br/><br/>- Best operator approximation,<br/>- Non-Lagrange interpolation,<br/>- Generic Karhunen-Loeve transform<br/>- Generalised low-rank matrix approximation<br/>- Optimal data compression<br/>- Optimal nonlinear filtering', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/03/9780124366503.jpg', 'title_long': 'Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations, Vol. 74 (Mathematics in Science and Engineering)', 'edition': 2, 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.5070632026 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.5070632026}}, 'pages': 322, 'date_published': '1971-02-26', 'subjects': ['Mathematical Analysis', 'Mechanical', 'Linear', 'Mathematics & Statistics -> Calculus -> Introductory Linear Algebra', 'Mathematics & Statistics -> Mathematics -> Mathematics General', 'Trades & Technology -> Industrial Technology -> Mechanical'], 'authors': ['Anatoli Torokhti', 'Phil Howlett'], 'title': 'Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations, Vol. 74 (Mathematics in Science and Engineering)', 'isbn13': '9780124366503', 'msrp': 164.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0124366503', 'isbn10': '0124366503', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780080955834', 'binding': 'eisbncanonical'}]}}
