{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': 'In this delicious new novel, Tatiana Boncompagni creates a heroine everyone will love...and no one will ever forget.<br/>As Lily Bartholomew navigates kiddie birthday parties starring chart-topping entertainment, society dinner-dances where any woman larger than a size 2 can barely stand to show her Botoxed face, and vacations to exclusive hideaways with the mother-in-law from hell, she constantly wonders, "On what planet have I landed?"<br/>After all, she\'s just a down-to-earth gal from suburbia who felt as if she\'d landed in the middle of a fairy tale when she married Robert. He\'s handsome, rich, and—best of all—able to make her laugh, and she happily jumped headfirst into his world. But now Robert\'s lost his job, Lily hasn\'t lost her pregnancy weight, and their once-golden existence seems suddenly tarnished.<br/>Desperate to regain her self-esteem, Lily begins writing essays about life among the rich and snobbish, which tosses her into the spotlight and in the path of social disaster. But as Lily navigates her way through the shark-infested waters of Manhattan society, she starts to rediscover her own place in the world—and how to regain what truly matters.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/10/9780061451010.jpg', 'title_long': 'Gilding Lily', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.54 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.54}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 300, 'date_published': '2008-09-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'City Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Divorce', 'Domestic Life', 'Mothers & Children', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Tatiana Boncompagni'], 'title': 'Gilding Lily', 'isbn13': '9780061451010', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061982555'}, 'isbn': '0061451010', 'isbn10': '0061451010', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061982552', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
