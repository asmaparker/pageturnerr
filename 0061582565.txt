{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'From the best-selling author of Baseball 100<br/>“Posnanski offers an eloquent reminder that the great Cincinnati Reds teams—especially the ‘75 Reds—deserve a place of prominence in our memory, same as this book demands a place of prominence on your shelf.” —New York Post<br/>There are great teams in baseball—and then there are classic teams like the 1975 Cincinnati Reds. From 1972 to 1976, the franchise known as the Big Red Machine dominated the National League, and their 1975 season has become the stuff of sports legend.<br/>In The Machine, award-winning sports columnist Joe Posnanski captures all of the passion and tension, drama and glory of this extraordinary championship team considered to be one of the greatest of all time. Helmed by Hall of Fame manager Sparky Anderson, the lineup for the ’75 Reds is a “Who’s Who” of baseball greats, including Pete Rose, Ken Griffey Sr., and Joe Morgan.<br/>But that remarkable year was not without controversy: feuds, fights, insults, and run-ins with fans were as much a part of the season as hits, runs, steals, and strikeouts. Capturing this rollicking thrill-ride of a story, Posnanski brings to life the excitement, hope, and high-expectations that surrounded the players from the beginning of spring training through the long summer and into a nailbiting World Series, where, in the ninth inning of the seventh game, the Big Red Machine fulfilled its destiny, defeating the Boston Red Sox 4-3.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/25/61/9780061582561.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Machine: A Hot Team, a Legendary Season, and a Heart-stopping World Series: The Story of the 1975 Cincinnati Reds', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1.06 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.06}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2009-09-15', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'World', 'Sports & Outdoors', 'Baseball', 'Miscellaneous', 'History of Sports'], 'authors': ['Joe Posnanski'], 'title': 'The Machine: A Hot Team, a Legendary Season, and a Heart-stopping World Series: The Story of the 1975 Cincinnati Reds', 'isbn13': '9780061582561', 'msrp': 25.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0061582565', 'isbn10': '0061582565'}}
