{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "Caldecott Medalist Paul O. Zelinsky illustrates Kelly Bingham's outrageously funny, critically acclaimed, and boundary-breaking story about a moose, a zebra, and the alphabet! Zebra wants to put on a show as simple as ABC, but Zebra's friend Moose has other (unexpected and hilarious) ideas!<br/>Zebra thinks the alphabet should be simple. A is for Apple. B is for Ball. Easy! But his friend Moose is too excited to wait his turn, and when M isn't for Moose (Mouse gets the honor), the rest of the letters better run for cover.<br/>Exuberant and zany storytelling brings to life two friends and one laugh-out-loud comedy of errors that's about friendship, sharing, and compromise.<br/>The incomparable Paul O. Zelinsky's artwork is bursting at the seams—literally—with child appeal. Breaking the borders of the page, and creating the art both digitally and traditionally, Zelinsky turns convention on its head. The result is a picture book that is innovative, hilarious, and begging to be read over and over again.<br/>Z Is for Moose will bring laughter and fun to every story time and alphabet lesson, whether in school or at home.<br/>Named a Notable Book for Children by the American Library Association", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/98/54/9780060799854.jpg', 'title_long': 'Z Is for Moose', 'edition': 'Illustrated', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.1 Inches, Length: 11.3 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 11.3}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.1}}, 'pages': 32, 'date_published': '2012-02-28', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Humor'], 'authors': ['Kelly Bingham'], 'title': 'Z Is for Moose', 'isbn13': '9780060799854', 'msrp': 17.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0060799854', 'isbn10': '0060799854'}}
