Trimming the hedgerow one sunny morning, those incomparable partners in crime, Nigel and Georgia Strangeways, discover a tarnished locket. Hidden inside are dark secrets which threaten the nation’s democracy.<br/><br/>Leaving Nigel disconsolate at home, Georgia sets off on an hilarious romp across the country, pursuing a clique of Little Englanders inspired by Fascist Germany.<br/><br/>In her battle for Britain she encounters reckless gamblers and a quiet village vicar, England’s top batsman and the Radiance Girls in flowing orange chiffon, and, most suspicious of all, a peer of the realm with more on his mind than a coronet. Who is friend? Who is foe? Who would destroy the sanctity of England’s green and pleasant land?', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/45/72/9780060804572.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Smiler With the Knife: A Nigel Strangeways Mystery', 'dimensions': 'Weight: 0.3 Pounds', 'dimensions_structured': {'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}}, 'pages': 243, 'date_published': '1988', 'subjects': ['Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery'], 'authors': ['Nicholas Blake'], 'title': 'The Smiler With the Knife: A Nigel Strangeways Mystery', 'isbn13': '9780060804572', 'msrp': 3.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060804572', 'isbn10': '0060804572'}}
