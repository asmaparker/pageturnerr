{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'In this revolutionary work -- a landmark that signals the true beginning of feminist medicine -- a doctor, a philosopher, and a scientist prove that by postponing marriage and motherhood, women have accelerated the aging process, resulting in earlier menopause and, ultimately for thousands, earlier death. In Sex, Lies, and Menopause, T.S. Wiley, Julie Taguchi, M.D., and Bent Formby, Ph.D., turn thirty years of medical and cultural wisdom on its head, challenging both<br/>the medical establishment and modern feminists who believe women can delay childbearing that menopause, a natural state of female maturity, does not have to lead to potentially deadly medical conditions.<br/>Sex, Lies, and Menopause offers strong evidence that the use of synthetic hormones leads to cancer and advises women to turn to natural hormone replacement therapy -- derived from plants, not drugs -- to help them elevate their estrogen level for greater energy, libido, and intellectual capacity. A groundbreaking effort of creative insight and astute research, this book fearlessly tackles one of the greatest health crises facing American women today.<br/>Provocative, empowering, and scientifically sound, Sex, Lies, and Menopause addresses the inherent benefits of natural progesterone, reveals the lies advanced by the medical and drug establishments, and challenges women to demand a medical future where their health comes first. The research presented here will at last allow women to create their own plan of action by safely putting themselves on the path to better health and hormonal balance at any stage of life.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/37/9780060542337.jpg', 'title_long': 'Sex, Lies, and Menopause: The Shocking Truth About Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'height: 248 mm, length: 165 mm, width: 32 mm, weight: 680 g', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 165}, 'width': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 32}, 'weight': {'unit': 'g', 'value': 680}, 'height': {'unit': 'mm', 'value': 248}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2003-09-02', 'subjects': ['Health, Fitness & Dieting', "Women's Health", 'General', 'Sexual Health', 'Medical Books', 'Medicine', 'Internal Medicine'], 'authors': ['T.
