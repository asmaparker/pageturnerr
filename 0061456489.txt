{'book': {'publisher': 'Smithsonian', 'synopsis': "Do Cats Hear with Their Feet? traces the evolution of cats from the time they first adapted their feline form about 20 million years ago. Exploring every aspect of a cat's life—from predation, to play, to communication—Jake Page shows us what a cat's daily life is really like. He gives us a cat's-eye view of a bird hunt in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and explains why cats will hunt even when they are full, and why no self-respecting cat would eat vegetables. In sections that will be of interest to every cat owner, Jake Page demonstrates why territory is all-important to cats, investigates cat ESP, and shows that cats have, in fact, never been fully domesticated; they've just graciously decided to reside with us. Beautifully illustrated, this engaging book is full of surprising facts. Did you know: Black cats do better in the crowded conditions of cities than any other color? Cats are as allergic to humans as humans are to cats? Cats have survived falls from heights of over seven stories?<br/>Do Cats Hear with Their Feet? will show readers exactly why cats are such amazing creatures, and why humans have been crazy about them for centuries.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/64/80/9780061456480.jpg', 'title_long': 'Do Cats Hear with Their Feet?: Where Cats Come From, What We Know About Them, and What They Think About Us', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6 Inches, Weight: 0.91712300992 Pounds, Width: 0.81 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.81}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.91712300992}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 224, 'date_published': '2008-11-18', 'subjects': ['Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Cats', 'Science & Math', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals', 'Nature & Ecology', 'Fauna'], 'authors': ['Jake Page'], 'title': 'Do Cats Hear with Their Feet?: Where Cats Come From, What We Know About Them, and What They Think About Us', 'isbn13': '9780061456480', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'related': {'ePub': '006198020X'}, 'isbn': '0061456489', 'isbn10': '0061456489', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061980206', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
