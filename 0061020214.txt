{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Voyager', 'synopsis': '3000 A.D. Years ago, humans colonized Mars, bringing with them specimens of long-extinct Earth life for regeneration on this new frontier. But humankind has disappeared, and the animals have been left behind to fend for themselves. Icebones, daughter of Silverhair, had been the only adult mammoth taken to Mars. As such, she is now the only one of her kind who carries the accumulated knowledge of mammoth history, and it is up to her to teach her fellow mammoths how to survive -- and thrive -- without their human keepers.<br/>In the grand tradition of Watership Down, Stephen Baxter has created a complex society complete with elaborate myths and legends. With Icebones, he brilliantly and dramatically brings the acclaimed Mammoth trilogy to its resounding conclusion.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/02/16/9780061020216.jpg', 'title_long': 'Icebones', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.3 Pounds, Width: 0.72 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.72}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2003-01-28', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy', 'Science Fiction'], 'authors': ['Stephen Baxter'], 'title': 'Icebones', 'isbn13': '9780061020216', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'isbn': '0061020214', 'isbn10': '0061020214'}}
