{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': "Brind, who was raised with Sir Edmund's pack of hunting dogs, is the huntsman of Dowe Manor. Together with his best friend, the mastiff Glaive, and the rest of the pack, he protects Sir Edmund, Lady Beatrice, and their foster daughter, Aurélie.<br/>But suddenly a tragedy strikes, one that Brind cannot prevent. In a fit of grief, Sir Edmund throws Brind, Glaive, and Aurélie—and her puppy, Gabion—out of the manor. Everywhere they turn, the vicious and lethal Black Death closely follows, as though they are bringing it with them. Can they evade this invisible enemy, as well as the angry mobs, the rogue soldiers, and the other sinister figures now threatening them? Glaive and Gabion—born to hunt, not to be hunted—may be their only chance for survival. Plague-bringers or not, Brind and Aurélie will never stop fighting to keep themselves—and their small family—alive.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/01/9780060841201.jpg', 'title_long': 'Hunted', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.93 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.93}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 272, 'date_published': '2007-05-08', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Action & Adventure'], 'authors': ['Christopher Russell'], 'title': 'Hunted', 'isbn13': '9780060841201', 'msrp': 16.89, 'binding': 'Library Binding', 'isbn': '0060841206', 'isbn10': '0060841206'}}
