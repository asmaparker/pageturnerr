{'book': {'publisher': 'Ecco', 'synopsis': 'Virginia Woolf was already an accomplished novelist and critic when she was commissioned by the British edition of Good Housekeeping to write a series entitled "Six Articles on London Life." Originally published bimonthly, beginning in December 1931, five of the essays were eventually collected and published in 1981. The sixth essay, "Portrait of a Londoner," had been missing from Woolf\'s oeuvre until it was rediscovered at the University of Sussex in 2004. Ecco is honored to publish the complete collection in the United States for the first time.<br/>A walking tour of Woolf\'s beloved hometown, The London Scene begins at the London Docks and follows Woolf as she visits several iconic sites throughout the city, including the Oxford Street shopping strip, John Keats\'s house on Hampstead Heath, Thomas Carlyle\'s house in Chelsea, St. Paul\'s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, and the Houses of Parliament.<br/>These six essential essays capture Woolf at her best, exploring modern consciousness through the prism of 1930s London while simultaneously painting an intimate, touching portrait of this sprawling metropolis and its fascinating inhabitants.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/83/9780060881283.jpg', 'title_long': 'The London Scene: Six Essays on London Life', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.25 Inches, Length: 5.125 Inches, Weight: 0.45 Pounds, Width: 0.516667 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.516667}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.45}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}}, 'pages': 96, 'date_published': '2006-07-03', 'subjects': ['History', 'Americas', 'United States', 'Europe', 'Great Britain', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Essays & Correspondence', 'Essays', 'Politics & Social Sciences', "Women's Studies", 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Virginia Woolf'], 'title': 'The London Scene: Six Essays on London Life', 'isbn13': '9780060881283', 'msrp': 11.5, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060881283', 'isbn10': '0060881283'}}
