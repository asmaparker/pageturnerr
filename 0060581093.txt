{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': "Los Angeles writer Cece Caruso is thrilled that her biography of the legendary Dashiell Hammett is headed for the big screen. Even better, she's been hired to tutor Rafe Simic, the actor cast as the lead. Okay, so he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. At least he's easy on the eyes, and the money's good enough to feed Cece's addiction to vintage Yves St. Laurent.<br/>But in the midst of her teaching him the ABCs of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man, the body of a woman is discovered and Rafe's picture is found among her effects. The woman was an old flame, and the facts -- and Rafe's alibi -- just don't add up. Cece, who makes her living getting into the minds of mystery writers, can't help but ask questions.<br/>In a tale of thrills, suspense, and surprising twists that would confound even the best P.I., Cece sets out to find justice for the dead woman, even if it means pulling the plug on the movie -- assuming someone doesn't pull the plug on Cece first.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/91/9780060581091.jpg', 'title_long': 'Shamus in the Green Room: A Cece Caruso Mystery (also titled Sam Spade in the Green Room)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 1.05 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.05}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2006-05-30', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'United States', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths'], 'authors': ['Susan Kandel'], 'title': 'Shamus in the Green Room: A Cece Caruso Mystery (also titled Sam Spade in the Green Room)', 'isbn13': '9780060581091', 'msrp': 23.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060581093', 'isbn10': '0060581093'}}
