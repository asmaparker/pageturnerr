{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon A', 'synopsis': "In Mindy's yoga-obsessed, thirty-is-the-new-wife neighborhood, every day is a battle between Dunkin' Donuts, her jaws-of-life jeans, and Beth Diamond, the self-absorbed sancti-mommy next door who looks sixteen from the back. So much for sharing the chores, the stores, and the occasional mischief to rival Wisteria Lane.<br/>It's another day, another dilemma until Beth's marriage becomes fodder on Facebook. Suddenly the Ivy League blonde needs to be “friended,” and Mindy is the last mom standing. Together they take on hormones and hunger, family feuds and fidelity, and a harrowing journey that spills the truth about an unplanned pregnancy and a seventy-year-old miracle that altered their fates forever.<br/>Dear Neighbor, Drop Dead is a hilarious, stirring romp over fences and defenses that begs the question, what did you do to deserve living next door to a crazy woman? Sometimes it's worth finding out.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/37/75/9780061253775.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dear Neighbor, Drop Dead', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.79}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 319, 'date_published': '2008-07-22', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', 'Friendship', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Saralee Rosenberg'], 'title': 'Dear Neighbor, Drop Dead', 'isbn13': '9780061253775', 'msrp': 13.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061842982'}, 'isbn': '0061253774', 'isbn10': '0061253774', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061842986', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
