{'book': {'publisher': 'Merrill Pub Co', 'synopsis': 'From the Publisher      A thoughtful new text whose author believes early childhood education is vitally important...and treats the administration of early childhood programs as the serious business it is. While maintaining that quality childcare is the highest priority of an early childhood program, this text combines universal principles of early childhood administration with equally universal theories and practices of successful business management. Such topics as motivation, leadership, decision-making, and problem-solving are covered in greater depth than in other texts in the field, and the text specifically shows how proven theories of management can improve not only the administration of programs for young children, but the care of those children, as well.      From the Back Cover      A basic book for Administration and Programming subjects. This book covers all aspects on how to set up, manage and administer programs.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/04/12/9780024100412.jpg', 'title_long': 'Administration and Management of Programs for Young Children', 'edition': '1', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 1.66228545548 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.66228545548}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '1995-02-15', 'subjects': ['Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Education Theory', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Cynthia Jones Shoemaker'], 'title': 'Administration and Management of Programs for Young Children', 'isbn13': '9780024100412', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0024100412', 'isbn10': '0024100412'}}
