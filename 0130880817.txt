Focused chapters present effective strategies for young children, adolescents, and students of diverse backgrounds. Up-to-date content includes ADHD, peer monitoring and mediation, behavior management research, assessment tools, and cultural influences. Special coverage of preschool children highlights the special characteristics of this population and the special considerations they demand—also covering ethnic background, culture, and family customs as they relate to behavior management. For pre-service and in-service teachers in regular and special education environments at all levels—preschool, elementary, and secondary, and also for educational administrators, counselors, psychologists, and social workers.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/08/19/9780130880819.jpg', 'title_long': 'Behavior Management: Applications for Teachers (3rd Edition)', 'edition': 'Subsequent', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.5 Inches, Length: 7.75 Inches, Weight: 2.20462262 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 2.20462262}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.5}}, 'pages': 540, 'date_published': '2000-05-12', 'subjects': ['Science & Math', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Education Theory', 'Instruction Methods', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Thomas J.
