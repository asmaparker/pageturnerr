{'book': {'publisher': 'Farrar Straus & Giroux', 'synopsis': 'Product Description      Turned into a monkey by a wicked desert witch until a girl who shines like stars kisses him, Abeli plays the flute, at last Dunja breaks the spell      From Publishers Weekly      Abeli is the son of a gifted musician and, although he questions why his father does not "work" like everyone else, he becomes skilled at his father\'s craft. A desert witch, jealous of his ability, turns him into a monkey--a bondage that can be broken only by the kiss of a beautiful girl. Word of the musical creature travels quickly, and Abeli passes from hand to hand. Although he plays for no less than the Caliph, he finds happiness in the end with a humble bedouin\'s daughter, and henceforth his music brings cooling rains and makes the desert bloom. This exquisite picture book--Rehnman\'s first--not only testifies to the power of music to enrich our lives; it also demonstrates that storytelling and art can be similarly transforming. The illustrations merit particular note: brilliantly colored, and with the lush, intricate patterns of a Persian rug, they offer a sensual feast of desert and bazaar scenes. Ages 3-up.
