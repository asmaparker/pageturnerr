{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Dear Reader,<br/>These are two of my classic historical romances, and I love both of them.When I heard that they were going to be re-published together, I was thrilled. Connor d'Arcy, Lord Earl of Iveagh, the hero of Dark of the Moon, is one of my favorite heroes ever. (I'm still a sucker for tall, dark, brooding, masterful men with a secret!) Together, he and Caitlyn O'Malley steam up the eighteenth-century Irish countryside in an epic romantic adventure that made my heart pound while I was writing it and, I hope, has the same effect on yours as you read it.<br/>Joss, from Desire in the Sun, is another great hero -- still masterful, still sinfully handsome -- but unlike Connor, afflicted with a lady who is determined to rule him. The fireworks generated by those two will leave you breathless.<br/>I've re-read them several times myself, just for fun (it's great to be able to go back and read and enjoy your own books, by the way) and, for me, they're still magical. I think you'll find them magical, too.<br/>Enjoy!<br/>With warmest wishes,<br/>Karen Robards", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/75/31/9780060847531.jpg', 'title_long': 'Dark of the Moon and Desire in the Sun', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 1.15 Pounds, Width: 1.84 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.84}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 816, 'date_published': '2005-08-09', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical'], 'authors': ['Karen Robards'], 'title': 'Dark of the Moon and Desire in the Sun', 'isbn13': '9780060847531', 'msrp': 10.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060847530', 'isbn10': '0060847530'}}
