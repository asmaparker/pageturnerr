{'book': {'publisher': 'Amistad', 'synopsis': "African Americans have been drawn to the sea for hundreds of years. In this collection of biographies, Eloise Greenfield examines how that connection to the sea has influenced generations of African Americans -- from a shipbuilder-businessman during the American Revolution to the first woman and African American to hold the highest-ranking position in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps. The lives of the extraordinary men and women included here create a stirring image of the powerful tie between African Americans and the water that has both bound them and set them free. Jan Spivey Gilchrist's artwork is as evocative as the profiles of the people it illustrates.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/99/11/9780060289911.jpg', 'title_long': 'How They Got Over: African Americans and the Call of the Sea', 'edition': 'First American Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 7.25 Inches, Weight: 0.9 Pounds, Width: 0.601648 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.601648}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 128, 'date_published': '2002-12-24', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Biographies', 'Historical', 'Multicultural', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Multicultural Stories'], 'authors': ['Eloise Greenfield'], 'title': 'How They Got Over: African Americans and the Call of the Sea', 'isbn13': '9780060289911', 'msrp': 1.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060289910', 'isbn10': '0060289910'}}
