{'book': {'publisher': 'Harper Perennial', 'synopsis': "A congressional adviser and habitu√© of a cozy circuit of bars inside the Beltway, Joel Lingeman never quite felt middle-aged. At least not until he was abandoned by his partner of fifteen years and suddenly thrust into a dating scene with men half his age and no discernible trace of love handles. But this unexpected hole in his life inspires Joel's search for a 1964 edition ofan Esquire-like magazine that contained a swimsuit ad that obsessed and haunted him throughout his youth. Determined to find out what happened to the model shown in the ad, Joel slowly begins to understand what has happened to his own life. Sexy, smart, and deftly observed, Man About Town is a new twist on the idea that the personal is political and a must read for anyone who's ever wondered what happened to that first crush.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/22/9780007156122.jpg', 'title_long': 'Man About Town: A Novel', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.3125 Inches, Weight: 0.69 Pounds, Width: 0.92 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.3125}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.92}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.69}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 368, 'date_published': '2004-04-08', 'subjects': ['LGBTQ+ Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Political', 'Family Life', 'City Life', 'Romance', 'LGBTQ+ Romance'], 'authors': ['Mark Merlis'], 'title': 'Man About Town: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780007156122', 'msrp': 10.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '006204155X'}, 'isbn': '000715612X', 'isbn10': '000715612X', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062041555', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
