{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': '"Every story has a narrator. Someone who writes it down after it\'s all over. Why am I the narrator of this story? I am because it is the story of my life—and of the people I love most. . . ." Harry and Madeleine Winslow have been blessed with talent, money, and charm. Harry is a National Book Award–winning author on the cusp of greatness. Madeleine is a woman of sublime beauty and grace whose elemental goodness and serenity belie a privileged upbringing. Bonded by deep devotion, they share a love that is both envied and admired. The Winslows play host to a coterie of close friends and acolytes eager to bask in their golden radiance, whether they are in their bucolic East Hampton cottage, abroad in Rome thanks to Harry\'s writing grant, or in their comfortable Manhattan brownstone. One weekend at the start of the summer season, Harry and Maddy, who are in their early forties, meet Claire and cannot help but be enchanted by her winsome youth, quiet intelligence, and disarming naivete. Drawn by the Winslows\' inscrutable magnetism, Claire eagerly falls into their welcoming orbit. But over the course of the summer, her reverence transforms into a dangerous desire. By Labor Day, it is no longer enough to remain one of their hangers-on. A story of love, lust, deception, and betrayal as seen through the omniscient eyes of Maddy\'s childhood friend Walter, a narrator akin to Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby, Indiscretion is a juicy, richly textured novel filled with fascinating, true-to-life characters—an irresistibly sensual page-turner that explores having it all and the consequences of wanting more. Indiscretion also marks the debut of a remarkably gifted writer and storyteller whose unique voice bears all the hallmarks of an exciting new literary talent.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/10/72/9780062201072.jpg', 'title_long': 'Indiscretion: A Novel', 'edition': 1, 'dimensions': 'ePub', 'pages': 402, 'date_published': '2013', 'subjects': ['Literary', 'General', 'Contemporary', 'English & College Success -> English -> Fiction'], 'authors': ['Charles Dubow'], 'title': 'Indiscretion: A Novel', 'isbn13': '9780062201072', 'msrp': 11.99, 'binding': 'Kindle Edition', 'related': {'Paperback': '0062201069'}, 'isbn': '0062201077', 'isbn10': '0062201077', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780062201065', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
