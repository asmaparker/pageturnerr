{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': 'Originally published in 1988, Anthony Storr\'s enlightening meditation on the creative individual\'s need for solitude has become a classic.<br/><br/>Solitude was seminal in challenging the established belief that "interpersonal relationships of an intimate kind are the chief, if not the only, source of human happiness." Indeed, most self-help literature still places relationships at the center of human existence. Lucid and lyrical, Storr\'s book cites numerous examples of brilliant scholars and artists -- from Beethoven and Kant to Anne Sexton and Beatrix Potter -- to demonstrate that solitude ranks alongside relationships in its impact on an individual\'s well-being and productivity, as well as on society\'s progress and health. But solitary activity is essential not only for geniuses, says Storr; the average person, too, is enriched by spending time alone.<br/>For fifteen years, readers have found inspiration and renewal in Storr\'s erudite, compassionate vision of human experience.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/34/97/9780006543497.jpg', 'title_long': 'Solitude', 'dimensions': 'Height: 1.25 Inches, Length: 9 Inches, Weight: 0.3527396192 Pounds, Width: 6 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.3527396192}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.25}}, 'pages': 240, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Parenting & Relationships'], 'authors': ['Anthony Storr'], 'title': 'Solitude', 'isbn13': '9780006543497', 'msrp': 16.5, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0006543499', 'isbn10': '0006543499'}}
