{'book': {'publisher': 'Allen & Unwin', 'synopsis': "In Scotland and Nationalism Christopher Harvie argues that any proper understanding of the future of Scotland - and, for that matter, of Britain - depends on relating past history to present politics. He approaches this through three principal themes - the political nationalist movement; the institutions and orientations of Scottish society; and the role of intellectuals in first maintaining and then altering the political settlement. For with the end of Empire, and the failure to solve Scotland's economic and social problems, the foundations of the Union have been eroded, and the country is experiencing for the first time the political evolution which other European nations underwent a century or more ago.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/00/77/9780049410077.jpg', 'title_long': 'Scotland and nationalism: Scottish society and politics, 1707-1977', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'pages': 318, 'date_published': '1977', 'authors': ['Christopher T Harvie'], 'title': 'Scotland and nationalism: Scottish society and politics, 1707-1977', 'isbn13': '9780049410077', 'msrp': 2.43, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0049410075', 'isbn10': '0049410075'}}
