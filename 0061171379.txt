{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins Publishers', 'synopsis': "Not even a big budget can help Alex make her sister's wedding the event of the year. The usually calm and collected Alex is rattled when the man who walked out on her sixteen years ago to pursue a rock-and-roll career returns to be the best man. In desperation, she calls on her three best friends to help pull off the shindig, and keep her away from the devastatingly handsome Josh. Tomboy Ellen, shy Jan, and vivacious Sue Ann join forces to keep Alex on track. But fate won't be stopped in this small seaside town. Alex finds it as impossible to avoid Josh as it is to deny that he's a changed man. Is it too late for their love? Only faith, family, and best friends will tell.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/13/76/9780061171376.jpg', 'title_long': 'Wedding Bell Blues (The Piper Cove Chronicles #1)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.51 Pounds, Width: 0.68 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.68}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.51}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 292, 'date_published': '2007-06-26', 'subjects': ['Christian Books & Bibles', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'United States', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Mystery', 'Clean & Wholesome'], 'authors': ['Linda Windsor'], 'title': 'Wedding Bell Blues (The Piper Cove Chronicles #1)', 'isbn13': '9780061171376', 'msrp': 9.98, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061755583'}, 'isbn': '0061171379', 'isbn10': '0061171379', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061755583', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
