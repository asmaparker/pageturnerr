{'book': {'publisher': 'Rayo', 'synopsis': 'Standing at the podium, Victor Villase単or looked at the group of educators amassed before him, and his mind flooded with childhood memories of humiliation and abuse at the hands of his teachers. He became enraged. With a pounding heart, he began to speak of these incidents. When he was through, to his great disbelief he received a standing ovation. Many in the audience could not contain their own tears.<br/>So begins the passionate, touching memoir of Victor Villase単or. Highly gifted and imaginative as a child, Villase単or coped with an untreated learning disability (he was finally diagnosed, at the age of forty-four, with extreme dyslexia) and the frustration of growing up Latino in an English-only American school in the 1940s. Despite teachers who beat him because he could not speak English, Villase単or clung to his dream of one day becoming a writer. He is now considered one of the premier writers of our time.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/61/39/9780060526139.jpg', 'title_long': 'Burro Genius: A Memoir', 'edition': 'Later Printing Used', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8 Inches, Length: 5.31 Inches, Weight: 0.6 Pounds, Width: 0.79 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.31}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.79}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.6}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8}}, 'pages': 352, 'date_published': '2005-09-20', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Community & Culture', 'Hispanic & Latin', 'People with Disabilities', 'Memoirs', 'Regional U.S.', 'West', 'Reference', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Ethnic Studies', 'Education & Teaching', 'Schools & Teaching', 'Special Education', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Victor Villasenor'], 'title': 'Burro Genius: A Memoir', 'isbn13': '9780060526139', 'msrp': 11.98, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0060526130', 'isbn10': '0060526130', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061734267', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
