{'book': {'publisher': 'Avon', 'synopsis': "If he could really see the future . . .<br/>Logan Sinclair is nothing but a fraud. Or at least that's what Inspector Andie Darling, undercover on the streets of San Francisco, is determined to prove. Sure, the sexy Scotsman may say he's a clairvoyant, but Andie's never believed in second sight—or love at first sight. So why does his sweet talk turn her into a lovestruck fool?<br/>He'd know that Andie Darling always gets her man . . .<br/>Getting the goods on the elusive con man would get Andie out of boring Vice and into Homicide, yet all she can think about is getting into Logan's arms. But juggling her job and her heart leaves her with little time to protect herself from a crazed killer hot on her heels. Logan would love to help Andie—and get closer to her—but charm might not be enough to save them now . . .", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/07/46/9780060850746.jpg', 'title_long': 'Killer Charms (The Darling Detectives Trilogy, 3)', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.39462744898 Pounds, Width: 0.96 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.96}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.39462744898}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 384, 'date_published': '2008-08-26', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Feel-Good', 'United States', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Romantic Comedy'], 'authors': ['Marianne Stillings'], 'title': 'Killer Charms (The Darling Detectives Trilogy, 3)', 'isbn13': '9780060850746', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'ePub': '0061982733'}, 'isbn': '0060850744', 'isbn10': '0060850744', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061982736', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
