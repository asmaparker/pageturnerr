{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': '“A manual for fixing our culture…In writing that is elegant and penetratingly simple, [hooks] gives voice to some things we may know in our hearts but need an interpreter like her to process.”—Black Issues Book Review<br/>New York Times bestselling author, acclaimed visionary and cultural critic bell hooks continues her exploration of the meaning of love in contemporary American society, offering groundbreaking, critical insight about Black people and love.<br/>Written from both historical and cultural perspectives, Salvation takes an incisive look at the transformative power of love in the lives of African Americans. Whether talking about the legacy of slavery, relationships and marriage in Black life, the prose and poetry of Martin Luther King, Jr., James Baldwin, and Maya Angelou, the liberation movements of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, or hip hop and gangsta rap culture, hooks lets us know what love’s got to do with it.<br/>Combining the passionate politics of W.E.B. DuBois with fresh, contemporary insights, hooks brilliantly offers new visions that will heal our nation’s wounds from a culture of lovelessness. Her writings on love and its impact on race, class, family, history, and popular culture will help us heal and create beloved American communities.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/49/40/9780060184940.jpg', 'title_long': 'Salvation: Black People and Love', 'edition': 'First Edition', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.62 Inches, Weight: 1 Pounds, Width: 0.89 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.62}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.89}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 256, 'date_published': '2001-01-09', 'subjects': ['Self-Help', 'Relationships', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Love & Romance', 'Health, Fitness & Dieting', 'Mental Health', 'Emotions', 'Psychology & Counseling', 'Sexuality', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Medical Books', 'Psychology', 'Politics & Social Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Popular Culture', 'Ethnic Studies', "Women's Studies", 'Feminist Theory'], 'authors': ['bell hooks'], 'title': 'Salvation: Black People and Love', 'isbn13': '9780060184940', 'msrp': 22, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060184949', 'isbn10': '0060184949'}}
