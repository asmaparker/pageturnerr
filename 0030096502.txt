{'book': {'publisher': 'Harcourt College Pub', 'synopsis': 'Bazarov—a gifted, impatient, and caustic young man—has journeyed from school to the home of his friend Arkady Kirsanov. But soon Bazarov’s outspoken rejection of authority and social conventions touches off quarrels, misunderstandings, and romantic entanglements that will utterly transform the Kirsanov household and reflect the changes taking place across all of nineteenth-century Russia.<br/><br/>Fathers and Sons enraged the old and the young, reactionaries, romantics, and radicals alike when it was first published. At the same time, Turgenev won the acclaim of Flaubert, Maupassant, and Henry James for his craftsmanship as a writer and his psychological insight. Fathers and Sons is now considered one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century.<br/><br/>A timeless depiction of generational conflict during social upheaval, it vividly portrays the clash between the older Russian aristocracy and the youthful radicalism that foreshadowed the revolution to come—and offers modern-day readers much to reflect upon as they look around at their own tumultuous, ever changing world.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/65/01/9780030096501.jpg', 'title_long': 'Fathers and Children', 'edition': 'Rinehart Ed', 'dimensions': 'Height: 8.25 Inches, Length: 5.5 Inches, Weight: 0.61068046574 Pounds, Width: 0.5 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.5}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.61068046574}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 8.25}}, 'pages': 261, 'date_published': '1997', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Specialty Boutique', 'New, Used & Rental Textbooks'], 'authors': ['Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev'], 'title': 'Fathers and Children', 'isbn13': '9780030096501', 'msrp': 32.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0030096502', 'isbn10': '0030096502'}}
