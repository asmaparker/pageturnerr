{'book': {'publisher': 'HarperCollins', 'synopsis': "In the Newbery Medalist's first book, Muna searches for his father, a samurai warrior, in 12th-century Japan.<br/>Muna has never known his father—a samurai, a noble warrior. But Muna's mother has told Muna how he will know him one day: by the sign of the chrysanthemum.<br/>When his mother dies, Muna travels to the capital of twelfth-century Japan, a bewildering city on the verge of revolution. He finds a haven there, as servant to the great swordsmith, Fukuji. But Muna cannot forget his dream: He must find his father. Only then will he have power and a name to be reckoned with.<br/>His desperate search for the father he has never seen leads thirteen-year-old Muna to danger and adventure in the crowded, colorful capital city of twelfth-century Japan. But where should he look for him? And how will he recognize him? His father left before Muna was born—and his mother is now dead. All that the boy knows of his father is that he is a great warrior, a samurai...and that he bears on his shoulder a chrysanthemum tattoo.<br/>Wars between two powerful clans divide the city, making his search more difficult and dangerous. Muna is torn between his respect for Fukuji, the brilliant swordsmith who takes him into his home, and his loyalty to Takanobu, a former samurai who is now an outlaw. Tempered by fire and sword, Muna finally discovers who he really is.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23/23/9780064402323.jpg', 'title_long': 'The Sign of the Chrysanthemum (Harper Trophy Book)', 'edition': 'Reissue', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.62 Inches, Length: 5.12 Inches, Weight: 0.22487150724 Pounds, Width: 0.29 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 5.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.29}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.22487150724}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.62}}, 'pages': 144, 'date_published': '1988-06-03', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Action & Adventure', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Katherine Paterson'], 'title': 'The Sign of the Chrysanthemum (Harper Trophy Book)', 'isbn13': '9780064402323', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0064402320', 'isbn10': '0064402320'}}
