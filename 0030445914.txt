{'book': {'publisher': 'Holt, Rinehart, and Winston', 'synopsis': 'In 1798, Irish patriots, committed to freeing their country from England, landed with a company of French troops in County Mayo, in westernmost Ireland. They were supposed to be an advance guard, followed by other French ships with the leader of the rebellion, Wolfe Tone.
