The Water Snake is heading for Vinland, a place far across the sea inhabited by a civilization of people and new mysterious creatures, some good and some perilous.<br/>But dangers untold lie closer than Peer and Hilde could have imagined. The ship's captain and his sword-wielding son are not what they seem, and Peer is forced to flee alone into the wild unknown.

At the end of it all, where will his loyalty lie?<br/>In this final novel in the Troll trilogy, Katherine Langrish crafts a rich story where Viking legend is intertwined with Native American life and lore based on the Mi'kmaq people.
