{'book': {'publisher': 'Ebury / Random House', 'synopsis': "Adam Goodfellow and Nicole Golding run a stable in the Cotswolds and specialise in curing problem horses. It's never an easy task, and often requires changing the habits of the owner as much as the horse. The pair have travelled a long way to get where they are today - but they've been united by a common passion.After a chance meeting with Monty Roberts, they gave up everything to live out their dreams and show that it's possible for ordinary people to become 'horse whisperers'. Their world is extraordinary, particularly through their unusual methods of teaching, and as you meet the cast of characters, both animals and humans, that surround them, you'll find it impossible not to be won over by their life.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/27/23/9780091882723.jpg', 'title_long': 'Whispering Back: Tales From a Stable in the English Countryside', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9.25 Inches, Length: 6.25 Inches, Weight: 1.15301763026 Pounds, Width: 1 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.25}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 1.15301763026}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9.25}}, 'pages': 292, 'date_published': '2003', 'subjects': ['Crafts, Hobbies & Home', 'Pets & Animal Care', 'Horses', 'Science & Math', 'Agricultural Sciences', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Biological Sciences', 'Animals'], 'authors': ['Adam Goodfellow', 'Nicole Golding'], 'title': 'Whispering Back: Tales From a Stable in the English Countryside', 'isbn13': '9780091882723', 'msrp': 29.99, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0091882729', 'isbn10': '0091882729'}}
