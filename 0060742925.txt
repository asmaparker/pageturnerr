{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow', 'synopsis': 'Should you ever give up the fast track? Could you settle down with the spirit of adventure still in your blood? And just how do you say "Mr. Wrong" in Spanish anyway? Fueled by tango addiction, the hope of romancing a sultry porteño, and a one-way ticket to Buenos Aires, Marina Palmer is about to find out.<br/>Approaching her dreaded thirtieth birthday -- without a doting husband, a fabulous apartment, or children and a nanny -- Marina Palmer suddenly found herself adrift in anxiety. She was a successful advertising executive but was bored by her job. Lasting love was proving elusive and her weekly visit to the therapist had multiplied by three. Then, on a whimsical vacation to South America, Palmer discovered the passion that her life was missing. At a steamy two a.m. milonga, she caught her first glimpse of Argentina\'s signature dance and fell head over heels from the sidelines.<br/>Leaving behind her fast-track career and her desperation to meet "the One," Palmer returned to Buenos Aires to pursue a new dream. Moving thousands of miles from friends and family, she arrived in Argentina seeking a dancing partner, storybook love, and the tango lessons that might ultimately help her earn a place on the professional circuit. Exploring her new city by day and seducing sexy Argentines on the dance floor by night, her tango obsession ruled her life. She\'d never been thinner -- tango is the world\'s most erotic weight-loss plan! -- more confident, or closer to her definition of having it all.<br/>From auditioning for the Broadway hit Forever Tango, to becoming a street dancer on the infamous calle Florida, to discovering just how irresistible the sizzling porteños can be, Marina Palmer chronicles her exhilarating misadventures in Buenos Aires in no-holds-barred diary-style confessions full of adventure, romance, heartbreak, and steamy sex.<br/>Inspiring, outrageous, and bursting with passion, Kiss & Tango is the ideal book for anyone secretly daydreaming of taking their own gamble of a lifetime.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/29/28/9780060742928.jpg', 'title_long': 'Kiss and Tango: Looking for Love in Buenos Aires', 'dimensions': 'Height: 9 Inches, Length: 6.12 Inches, Width: 1.09 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.12}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 1.09}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 9}}, 'pages': 336, 'date_published': '2005-06-28', 'subjects': ['Arts & Photography', 'Performing Arts', 'Dance', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Arts & Literature', 'Dancers', 'Community & Culture', 'Women', 'Travelers & Explorers', 'Travel', 'South America', 'Argentina', 'General'], 'authors': ['Marina Palmer'], 'title': 'Kiss and Tango: Looking for Love in Buenos Aires', 'isbn13': '9780060742928', 'msrp': 24.95, 'binding': 'Hardcover', 'isbn': '0060742925', 'isbn10': '0060742925'}}
