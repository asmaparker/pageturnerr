{'book': {'publisher': 'Vermilion', 'synopsis': "Sue Martin was not three years old when she began life at her first children's home: a home that could at best be described as cold and regimented; at worst, torturous and terrifying. When her mother abandoned her to the protection of the home, Sue was soon to discover that behind the welcoming doors of this reputedly kind-hearted organization lay a world steeped in lies, cover-ups, victimization, and abuse. At its heart was Boagey, whose perverse bullying was targeted at Sue. Her attacks quickly progressed from the gratuitous punishment of an innocent child to sordid gratification of her sexual whims. Sue's story is one of institutional abuse— of physical, mental, and emotional torture of the most appalling kind— but it also a story full of joy, humor, and many victories— small and large— against her abusers. Utterly compelling and shockingly revelatory, No Way Home will astound, move, and inspire.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/73/71/9780091917371.jpg', 'title_long': 'No Way Home', 'dimensions': 'Height: 7.5 Inches, Length: 4.75 Inches, Weight: 0.4 Pounds, Width: 0.75 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.75}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.75}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.4}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}}, 'pages': 288, 'date_published': '2007-08-23', 'subjects': ['Biographies & Memoirs', 'Memoirs', 'Parenting & Relationships', 'Family Relationships', 'Abuse'], 'authors': ['Sue Martin'], 'title': 'No Way Home', 'isbn13': '9780091917371', 'msrp': 14.95, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0091917379', 'isbn10': '0091917379'}}
