{'book': {'publisher': 'Greenwillow Books', 'synopsis': 'Elana is thrilled to be living all the way up on the eighth floor of 514 Melon Hill Avenue, an apartment building in New York City. But with her new life come changes--and challenges. Is her shiny scooter up to the crags and potholes of city sidewalks? Will she be able to make new friends? Can she find a way to help out little Petey, who everyone says doesn\'t talk? And will the kids from Melon Hill win any blue ribbons at the Borough-Wide Field Day?<br/>As Elana coasts toward discoveries and surprises in her new home, she keeps one thing in mind: Anything can happen as long as you have a winning attitude and a cool set of wheels! Elana Rose Rosen and her mother have just moved to a new apartment, and this is Elana\'s story about the event-filled summer that follows and the new neighbors and friends that become an important part of her life. "A pleasure to read....A story, told with tremendous inventiveness, of the satisfactions and intellectual excitements of childhood, of the worlds seen, explained and illustrated through the remarkable eyes of a remarkable girl."--New York Times Book Review.', 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/96/81/9780064409681.jpg', 'title_long': 'Scooter', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 10 Inches, Length: 7.5 Inches, Weight: 0.9259415004 Pounds, Width: 0.44 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 7.5}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.44}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.9259415004}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 10}}, 'pages': 160, 'date_published': '2001-02-20', 'subjects': ["Children's Books", 'Growing Up & Facts of Life', 'Family Life', 'Friendship, Social Skills & School Life', 'Geography & Cultures', 'Explore the World', 'Where We Live', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Vera B Williams'], 'title': 'Scooter', 'isbn13': '9780064409681', 'msrp': 16.99, 'binding': 'Paperback', 'isbn': '0064409686', 'isbn10': '0064409686'}}
