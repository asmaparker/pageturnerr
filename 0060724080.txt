{'book': {'publisher': 'William Morrow Paperbacks', 'synopsis': "Though retired newspaper reporter Henrietta O'Dwyer Collins, Henrie O to her friends, once turned down a marriage proposal from Jimmy Lennox, he's still one of her most cherished friends. So when he asks for her help on behalf of his wife, world-famous documentary filmmaker Sophia Montgomery, Henrie O reluctantly agrees to join them on a Baltic cruise. Sophia is the stepmother to the now-grown heirs of a great fortune, who are none too happy that she controls their inheritance. But do they really want her dead? Jimmy thinks so, and he wants Henrie O to prove it.<br/>On the cruise, Henrie O soon realizes that this dysfunctional family is plunging toward destruction. As the ports of call pass—Copenhagen, Gdynia, Tallinn, St. Petersburg—death inexorably approaches. But Henrie O discovers that love, once kindled, never dies. When Jimmy is accused of murder and time is running out, she pursues a clever killer who won't hesitate to strike again.", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/40/85/9780060724085.jpg', 'title_long': 'Set Sail for Murder (Henrie O, 7)', 'edition': '~', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.19 Inches, Weight: 0.34 Pounds, Width: 0.8 Inches', 'dimensions_structured': {'length': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 4.19}, 'width': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 0.8}, 'weight': {'unit': 'pounds', 'value': 0.34}, 'height': {'unit': 'inches', 'value': 6.75}}, 'pages': 320, 'date_published': '2008-03-25', 'subjects': ['Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction', 'Family Life', "Women's Fiction", 'Domestic Life', 'Mystery, Thriller & Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Women Sleuths', 'Cozy', 'Amateur Sleuths', 'Thrillers & Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Self Service', 'Custom Stores'], 'authors': ['Carolyn Hart'], 'title': 'Set Sail for Murder (Henrie O, 7)', 'isbn13': '9780060724085', 'msrp': 6.99, 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061844829', 'ePub': '0061844829'}, 'isbn': '0060724080', 'isbn10': '0060724080', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061844829', 'binding': 'print'}]}}
