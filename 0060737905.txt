Now uneasy mem-ories from a decade earlier are beginning to surface for Claire—especially those of a woman whose body was found at the bottom of a cliff in Northern Ireland. It had looked like suicide, but clues suggested it might have been murder. And if it was murder, then the woman's enigmatic husband was likely to blame. But try as they might, Claire and her colleagues could not pin the murder on him.<br/>Flash forward ten years and, on holiday in the South of France, Claire runs into a man she has not seen for a decade: the elusive murder suspect. But did his wife really die at his hands? And if he is a murderer, why is Claire so violently attracted to him?", 'language': 'en', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/79/00/9780060737900.jpg', 'title_long': 'Meeting Point: A Novel', 'edition': '1st U.
